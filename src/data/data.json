All 193 member states agreed to the resolution. They recognised happiness as a global human goal. And they decided to make the 20th of March the International Day of Happiness.",

                    "‘I wish everyone around the world a very happy International Day of Happiness! The search for happiness is a serious business. Happiness for the whole human family is one of the main goals of the United Nations. Peace, plenty, lives of respect for all – this is what we seek. We want all men, women and children to enjoy all their human rights. We want all countries to know the joy of peace. We want both people and planet to be blessed with lasting development, and to be free of the terrible effects of climate change. Let us give thanks for what makes us happy. And let us give our efforts to filling our world with happiness.’",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But what makes people happy? Many people think that happiness depends on being rich and beautiful. But scientists and experts have studied happiness. They know this is not correct. Good and bad things happen to everyone. Many scientists and experts believe that happiness is something we can choose. They believe that happiness is not always about what happens to you. They believe that much happiness is about how you choose to react. You can choose to react to events in your life in a positive way. Dr. Amit Sood is an expert at the Mayo Clinic in the United States. He said,",

                    "‘Happiness is a habit or custom. Some of us are born happy. But most others have to choose it. We often, however, do not understand we have that choice. We also do not know how to exercise that choice. As a result we push happiness away. Do not let that not happen to you.’",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "So how can we choose to be happy? What do we need to do? Experts have a lot of different advice. But they agree that gratitude or being thankful is very important. You will learn to be happy or happier by being thankful.",

                    "Dr Robert Emmons is a leading expert on gratitude. He suggests many ways to become more thankful. One method he suggests is keeping a gratitude journal or book. Every day, write down things for which you are thankful. These things may be about you, events or people. He also suggests that you use the language of thankful people. You can use words like gifts, givers, blessings, blessed.",

                    "What things are people most grateful for? BUPA is a health organisation in the United Kingdom. BUPA did some research about the things that make people feel happy. They found that many small and simple things make people feel good. For example, sleeping in a clean, fresh bed. Another example: many people enjoy feeling the sun on their faces. Other people feel good when someone is kind to them.  Other people like laughing so hard it hurts or smelling freshly made bread.",

                    "It is a very joyful song. People around the world have enjoyed watching it. They have watched the song more than 750 million times on YouTube. And many people have even made their own versions of it. Williams told the BBC why he wrote the song.",

                    "‘It can be something as detailed as a long term goal. Or it could be something as simple as the way I feel when my son smiles. You should know that happiness is your right. It is a reaction to something, or someone, or a time.’",

                    "“My driver’s license came up for renewal. I needed to take a written test of the traffic laws. For days, I studied a little book of all the rules. My boyfriend David would try to persuade me to spend time with him. He wanted me to join him for a walk or to go to a party or even just to talk. I told him I could not take the time. Of course, I got perfect marks on the test. I ran to tell David. “My love,” he said, “why would you want to do that?” It was not the response I had expected. Suddenly I understood that I had sacrificed a great deal for a test that was not very important. I had spent days studying for it that I could have spent in much better ways.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This story is from Rachel Naomi Remen. She is from the United States. In that country, every driver must take a written test to get a driving license. But this test is not difficult. And the driver only needs to pass the test. A perfect result does not matter! Remen’s efforts to study were extreme – and unnecessary. This was a sign that Remen had a problem.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today, Remen is a doctor who studies human health and emotions. She also calls herself a “recovering perfectionist.” That means she used to be a perfectionist, but she is trying not to be one now. She tells the story of her driving test to show the problems of trying to be perfect. What is a perfectionist? Why was it so important to Remen to get a perfect result on her driving test? Today’s Spotlight is on being perfect.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Perfectionism is a very complex behaviour. It is part of a person’s character or personality. Perfectionists always try to do everything perfectly – without any mistakes, errors or faults. Some perfectionists may expect other people around them to be perfect too. On her website, Dr. Remen says:",

                    "“Before I began recovering from perfectionism I felt that I was always falling short. And so was everyone else. Who we were and what we did was never quite good enough. I sat in judgment on life itself. Perfectionism is the belief that life is broken.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many cultures place a high value on working to achieve perfect results. It can be good to always aim to be excellent. For example, some sports people may be perfectionists. They work hard for the best possible result. They try to perform perfectly in a competition. People also think the famous artist Michelangelo was a perfectionist. This quality probably helped him create his amazing works of art. Sometimes we even depend on the high expectations of perfectionists. For example, when a specialist is performing a surgery on our hearts, we would like it to be perfect.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "But perfectionism can often have negative results. Some people feel that they need to be perfect. They have very high expectations for themselves. Perfectionists measure their worth, or value, by how well they do everything. This kind of perfectionism can even become a mental disorder. Experts have identified three different kinds of perfectionism.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The first kind of perfectionism is based on the self. This is when a person requires himself to be perfect. Then, when he fails to do this, he is very disappointed. A man named Paul told his story about this kind of perfectionism to the Mental Health Foundation:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“I had been trying to do too much, too well and trying to please too many people. I had been expecting too much of myself for too long and putting too much pressure on myself. I was creating too much stress. That is a lot of ‘too muches’ for one person. I stopped looking forward to anything. I felt like I was useless and hopeless.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another kind of perfectionist expects other people to be perfect. People in relationships with the perfectionist often feel that they are always being criticized. They may feel that they can never be good enough to be loved. Kathy Miller is a perfectionist. She gives a small example of how her husband was never perfect enough for her:",

He led me into the kitchen and announced, “I washed the dishes for you!” As I put my arms around him and said, “Thank you!” I looked over his shoulder. I noticed pieces of food and drops of liquid on the table. “But you have not cleaned the table!” I thought. “You have not finished the job!”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "A third kind of perfectionism relates to social conditions. This kind of perfectionist believes that other people expect her to be perfect. This kind of perfectionism often begins when children have very demanding parents. Doctor Randy Frost has studied perfectionism for many years. He tells the magazine Psychology Today:",

                    "Voice 6",
                    "“Overly demanding and judgemental parents put a lot of pressure on children to achieve. Our studies show that is connected to perfectionism. Sometimes the parent is happy only when the child achieves something or spends a lot of time working at something. The parent’s high expectations are not spoken out loud but they are made clear by the environment.”",

                    "All three of these kinds of perfectionism can have negative effects. Perfectionism can lead to other emotional problems such as depression, using too much alcohol or other drugs, eating disorders or even suicide. Perfectionism can also be connected to other physical problems such as stress problems and heart conditions. However, there are many ways to reduce the need to be perfect. Ann Smith wrote a book called “Overcoming Perfectionism.” She gives some good ideas about having healthier expectations:",

                    "“The change starts with acknowledging our humanness. We learn to accept the best and worst of who we are. Some things about us will never change. Other parts of ourselves may be altered by life experiences. In the meantime, you are good enough for today – perfectly imperfect.”",

                    "It is not easy to stop being a perfectionist. Remember Kathy Miller who was not happy with her husband, even when he was helping her? She says that she is trying not to expect perfection. Her Christian faith has helped her to accept her husband, and herself. Miller writes:",

                    "“Giving myself grace has been a slow growth process. But I believe that God understands our mistakes. And he is willing to forgive them.

And minimalism is not about seeing how little you can live with. Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus write, teach, and speak about minimalism. They run the website theminimalists.com.

But they choose a small one. Some even build a house that is as small as a single room. A small house costs less money to build. It takes less time to clean. It costs less to heat and cool.

But people who practice minimalism say it is not just about the things people own. It is about people and relationships. It is about living the best life you can and choosing what is important.

It lasted for a long time. Then people began to use paper and liquid ink to mark the surface. When this happened, it was easier to write and send messages far away. But it was also easier to lose or destroy writing. Then pages of paper were collected in the first book. So, people could write more. Ballpoint pens let people write faster and more neatly. In fact, the whole history of writing is really people’s attempt to find ways to write faster and more clearly. In this way, computers and smartphones are just another step forward in writing.",

Then, you will make a line across, nearer to the top of the first line. However, if you are from a country like Japan, China, or Taiwan, you will probably use a different method to make an English “t”. It is common for people there to make the line across first. Then, they will make the line up and down. The line across will be closer to the middle. Adrienne Bernhard believes this difference in writing gets lost in typing. She wrote for the BBC,",

Look at the things that are particular to teenagers in almost all cultures – risk, seeking new experience and wanting to be with people their own age. That is the perfect mix of things to push you if you are 14 or 18 years old. These things make you get out and explore the world. It’s hard to do, and the risk is very great.

David Dobbs writes in National Geographic Magazine:",
                    "Voice 5",
                    "“Seeking new experience can lead to dangerous behavior. But it can also produce positive behavior – like the urge to meet more people, for example. This can create a wider circle of friends. This often makes us healthier, happier, safer, and more successful.”",
                    "Voice 2",

                    "Voice 5",

Earlier we heard that Charles Dickens said that laughter is infectious. This makes laughter sound like a disease. In fact, in an incident from 1962, laughter seemed like a virus. In that year three girls started to laugh at their school in Tanzania. They could not stop laughing. More girls started to laugh. Six weeks later 95 girls were laughing and could not stop. The school had to close. The laughing spread to other schools and villages. By the end of the incident, about 1,000 people had been affected.",

The other half watched something neutral. The researchers found that people who had watched something funny increased the time they could suffer pain.",

For example, instead of eating unhealthy food snacks, plan healthy things to eat. Make a resolution to eat more fruits and vegetables.

Write it on a piece of paper. Put it where you will see it every day. It could be in your kitchen or bathroom. You could make it into the wallpaper on your phone. This will remind you of your bigger goals.",

                    "The second tool of managing your time well is to plan out your week. When you plan out a week, you can make sure that you are spending time on things that are important. Plan out everything! Plan time for work, but also plan time for learning, exercise, rest, and time with family and friends. You may think this means you cannot have any fun. But a good plan can create freedom. Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky wrote a book called “Make Time”. In it, they write,",

But a completely planned day provides the freedom to concentrate on the moment. You do not have to think about what to do next. You can trust the plan set out by your past self.”",

Employees spend 28 percent of their time dealing with interruptions and then trying to get back to work.”",

                    "Distractions and interruptions are everywhere. But the fourth way to manage time is to minimize distractions. You cannot avoid all distractions – that is impossible! But you can try to have fewer distractions in your day. Turn off your phone. Turn the internet off on your computer. If possible, go somewhere that is not your office. Even if you only focus for an hour, you can get a lot done. There is very little in life or work that cannot wait one hour.",

While this man was in prison, he met a young woman. She was the daughter of the prison guard. She visited this man’s prison cell often. They could not always talk together. So he and the woman began to pass notes to each other through the prison bars. They fell in love with each other. When it was time for the prison to execute the man, he sent her one last letter. The last note he sent to her was a love note. He ended it, “from, your Valentine.”",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "There are different kinds of nursery rhymes. Some nursery rhymes are for helping a child to fall asleep. “Rock-a-bye Baby” is one of these. Other nursery rhymes are educational. They teach children about cultural traditions or about good behavior. Some nursery rhymes are games – they include movements. The children must do these movements with their hands or bodies.",

                    "Let’s listen to some different kinds of nursery rhymes from around the world. This first nursery rhyme is from Uganda in East Africa:",

                    "This nursery rhyme teaches children about healthy food. And it teaches children to take care of their bodies. Because it has rhyming sounds, this song is easy to remember! Parents and teachers often use songs to teach lessons. Songs can help children to remember important things – like cleaning their teeth.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The next nursery rhyme also uses rhyming to teach. This poem is from China. It teaches about the traditional customs of a very important Chinese holiday. It is called ‘Chinese New Year’:",

                    "You will find whenever the New Year comesthe Kitchen God will want some plums.The girls will want some flowers new;The boys will want firecrackers, too.A new soft hat will please PapaAnd a sugar cake for dear Mama.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This nursery rhyme teaches children about the special customs of the Chinese New Year holiday. For example, families celebrate Chinese New Year with special food. The nursery rhyme also teaches children to share with their family members. By repeating this rhyme, children will remember their traditional customs.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many cultures also have nursery rhymes to teach children about right and wrong actions. Here is a nursery rhyme from Thailand. It is named after a large fruit. The jackfruit has a hard, green skin. But inside, it has soft, yellow fruit around big seeds:",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are two more interesting things about this nursery rhyme. One is that it uses words that are not real! The beginning words – “Jum-Jee” – do not mean anything. These are just words that sound fun. They rhyme to make the song sound good. Many nursery rhymes have these kinds of words in them.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The Jum-Jee nursery rhyme is also a game. While the children sing it, they sit in a circle. They all put their hands into the middle. Then, one child counts the other children’s fingers while they sing together. When the song is finished, the child stops counting. The person with the finger last counted must pull their hand away. The song continues until only one child has a hand left in the middle of the circle.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many other nursery rhymes can also be used for games. Some have special motions for the children to do. They sing and move parts of their bodies at the same time. Listen to this nursery rhyme from Switzerland in Europe. It is a rhyme about a child named Joggeli riding a horse. Imagine how children would move while saying it.",
                    "Voice 7",
                    "Joggeli, can you ride?Yes, yes, yes.Have you got one leg each side?Yes, yes, yes.Did you give the horse some hay?Yes, yes, yes.Did you water it today?Nay, nay, nay.So let’s ride to townAnd go three times around.But then the horse starts buckingAnd Joggeli falls down down down.",

                    "Nursery rhymes can teach many things! They can teach children about being healthy and behaving well. They also teach about traditional culture. Nursery rhymes often use language in a fun way. And they can be used for movements or games. But one of the most important things about nursery rhymes is that they help create relationships.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Nursery rhymes help children create friendships with each other. They help teachers to give good lessons. And they also help create closeness between a child and her parent. Nursery rhymes are a way for parents to teach important lessons.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Lastly, parents use nursery rhymes to put their children to sleep – like the first rhyme we heard.  The last nursery rhyme is also a song from a parent to his child. The child is named Iro. This rhyme is from the Mina language of Benin, in West Africa. It shows the most important lesson that a parent can teach a child: that her mother and father love her.",

Some companies require a person on sabbatical to volunteer or further their education. But other companies place no requirements on what a person must do.",

This week’s program is about the COVID pandemic and our stories during that pandemic – how the pandemic affected each of us and how people experienced that worldwide problem. This program was written before we knew very much about the Delta variant and other variants that are affecting populations all around the world. And while this program does have a hopeful ending – and I do think that we will get through this – we also want to acknowledge and let you know that we know there is still a lot of pain around COVID around the world. This is not a problem that is going away soon and it needs all of us working together to make it go away and to make it better. So we hope that when you listen to this program you hear about the experiences that people around the world have had. We want to hear about your experiences too. But we also want you to hear the hope that people do have for finally getting through this pandemic. We hope that you enjoy this program.",

                    "“It was almost midnight. My roommate and I had been hanging out. It had been more than a week since we had left the house, because of the lockdown. So, we decided to go for a walk. No one was wearing masks, then. But there was also no one around. We walked to an intersection of streets. Normally, it would be crowded with people. Even on the weekdays, many people went to the bars. And a lot of cars travelled through. But there was no one. I remember I walked to the middle of the street. And then I lay down. I lay there for several minutes. No cars came. Nothing that night seemed real. Nothing seemed real for many nights after.”",

It led to the disease COVID-19. And it changed everyone’s lives. Countries shut down. People had to make big changes to the way they worked, shopped, and had relationships. When the pandemic began, these changes seemed strange. But soon, the restrictions seemed normal. Today’s Spotlight is on the coronavirus pandemic. It is about how that first year felt. We tell stories from different people around the world. We look at their experiences during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

I saw the new shopping mall I had not visited yet. I saw the restaurant where I had rice noodles last year. I saw the shop where I got a globe model when I was a child. All of these memories rushed into my head with the beautiful, but empty night view. A strong sense of isolation came over me. I felt extremely alone. I have no previous experience with such an outbreak. I was only a high school student when SARS happened. It did not affect my life very much.”",

Her father lived in a nursing home, where medical professionals would take care of him. COVID-19 was especially dangerous for older people. Someone in this nursing home caught COVID-19. The disease spread like a fire in a dry forest. And June was not able to see her father. She told NPR:",

Scientists did not know very much about it. People did not know how it would affect their loved ones. Angela Brangaccio had just given birth. Then doctors told her she was positive for COVID-19.

I could not think how this virus would feel in a three-month-old body. The pain that you feel when you are sick: If my baby feels like this, I cannot go on. <br>In the end, I decided I would move into a different room. I did not spend much time with my baby. I could not kiss her. I kept my mask on all the time. It was so hard. I am not joking when I say it was the worst 14 days of my life.”",

By early 2021, some countries had vaccinated some of their population.",

Normally, when Hoving sees an old, large marble statue, his first word is “old”, “beautiful”, “ancient”, or even “heavy”. Hoving has been around art for many years. His experience makes it easier for him to choose between real art and copies of real art. And when he looked at the statue, the first word he thought of was “fresh”. His snap judgement made him think the statue was not thousands of years old. It was new.",

You decide to turn right. You do not see that you have just stepped out on to a busy street. You look up and see that there is a car driving toward you.

Our past experiences help to form our decisions. This is what helps to make them natural. Snap judgements come from the unconscious part of our brain. So, we do not know we are making snap judgements until after we make them. We often do this when we meet people.",

                    "Snap judgements come from experience. But our experiences of people can be limited. Many of us do not know people of a different ethnicity or race. We mostly know people who are like us. So, when we see someone who looks different, our snap judgements are not based on experience. They are based on ideas from other people. Or they are based on stories in radio and television. These are prejudices. And snap judgements based on prejudice are often wrong.

                    "It is natural to make snap judgements about other people. However, these judgements are not always true. For example, imagine that you see a person with a different skin color than yours. You may have a thought like “I am smarter than he is” or “He is mean”. These are not good snap judgements. Thoughts like these are judgements about a person’s character and abilities.",

                    "People make snap judgements every single day. But we can decide how we let the snap judgements affect our lives.

At the time, it was popular to use groups of letters to signal words. It was also common to spell the words incorrectly, using the wrong letters, as a joke. A Boston newspaper used the letters “O” and “K” to mean “oll korrect.” The O meant “all”, and the K meant “correct”.",

His political party used the saying, “Vote for OK.” Van Buren was from a town in New York called Kinderhook. In this case, he used the letters OK to mean “Old Kinderhook.” The saying tried to give the message that Old Kinderhook was “all correct.” Van Buren lost the election. But many language experts think that the election saying helped to make “OK” a common word.",

For example, the word “waw-kay” in the Bantu and Wolof languages, or “o ke” in the Mande language. These words also commonly signal agreement. West African people were brought to the United States as slaves. The theory is that African slaves used these words when speaking English.

In today’s Spotlight we will look at some of these methods. Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good student.",

Often, students who are having a difficult time believe it is because they are not intelligent.  But this is not true! Learning is how you become intelligent. All of us begin, as children, with no knowledge. From there, we learn and grow. Being a student means continuing this process. It means knowing you may not seem intelligent now, but you will be. Believing that you can learn is the most important step in being a good student. Geoff Nixon is a writer at Gemm Learning. He writes about the importance of confidence.",

They might learn well by listening to podcasts, audiobooks, or even Spotlight English! But other people learn best by doing. It helps them to apply the knowledge. They might need to speak to others to learn best. Some people are social learners, and study best with others. Others must be alone to learn.

When you have no idea what is going to happen, you can feel worried, anxious, and out of control. Your fear response can turn on. Routines reduce stress naturally. They give some control back to you”.",

                    "Good students also study over many days. They do not try to study everything all at once. Instead, it is better to repeat the same information several times over a longer period.  Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist. He also studied memory. In 1885, he discovered that people forget at a fixed rate. If we learn a fact once, we lose that information quickly. But, if we learn it again after a short period, it will stay in our memories.

And that can cause shame and embarrassment. But if you do not ask, no one will be able to help. Questions are how we naturally seek answers. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. She studies the science of learning. She wrote that “Asking questions is what our brains were born to do.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "People also remember things that are similar to what they already know. This is because of the structure of the brain. Most of the brain is made of cells called neurons. When we learn something, different neurons connect to each other. When these neurons stay connected, it forms a memory. The more connections a memory has, the stronger it will be. For example, think of a person you know. When you think of that person, the same neurons become active in your brain – every time!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Memories can also link to other memories, making them stronger still. This is why memories with multiple senses last longer. For example, a memory where you experienced something by hearing, tasting, and smelling, may be very strong because you used more senses in the experience. These memories connect different parts of the brain. Think of the person you just remembered. Do you remember what their laugh sounds like? Do you remember the sound of their voice?",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Finally, we make memories when we have repeated experiences. Each time we do the same thing, our brains make new connections. Scientists say our neurons activate, or fire.  Richard Mohs uses practicing music as an example.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“If you play a piece of music over and over, certain cells in your brain fire repeatedly in a certain order. This makes it easier to repeat this firing later on. The result: You get better at playing music. You can play it faster, with fewer mistakes. Practice it long enough, and you will play it perfectly.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Practicing, or repeating information, is one of the most popular methods of remembering. If a person has vocabulary cards, they are using this method. But this is not always the best way to memorize. There are many methods which use the other ways we remember – or combine them.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another memorization method is called a mnemonic device. One well known mnemonic device is called an acronym. Acronyms are helpful in memorizing words. To create an acronym, find a list of words you would like to memorize. It is usually helpful if there is something similar about them. Then, take the first letter from each word. Organize those letters into a word or phrase. You have now made an acronym. Each letter in the final word stands in for another word. So, to memorize many words, you only have to remember one. One famous acronym for learning English conjunctions is FANBOYS. The F stands in for the word “for”. A stands for “and”. The rest stand for nor, but, or, yet, and so. Acronyms work because they make the information simple.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Another memorization method is visualization. In visualization, you think of an image or picture that represents the thing you are trying to remember. For example, imagine a person is trying to remember the name Melanie. He might think of a picture. In the picture, a woman is holding a melon fruit. She is crushing the melon with her knee. The sound of the two images will remind him of the name Melanie. The image is also very strange. It is easier for the mind to remember unusual things. Visualization works because it makes the foreign information into something familiar.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "One of the most interesting mnemonic devices is called the method of loci. It is also called a memory palace. To create a memory palace, a person must think of a familiar area, like a house, or a street. Then, she must imagine a journey through that space. In the journey, she stops at different, familiar areas. In each of these areas, she places an item. The item must have something to do with the thing she is trying to remember. Melanie Pinola is a writer and mental athlete. She competes with others to remember long lists of numbers or words. She wrote about the memory palace technique for Lifehacker.com.",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“For everyday use, the memory palace is helpful for remembering a list of things. Start a journey beginning at a place you know very well, like your home. Begin at your door. If you want to remember a grocery list, imagine the items you need. Imagine a container of milk overflowing on your doorstep. When you get inside, perhaps two giant steaks attack you in your doorway. Continue to your living room to find pretzels dancing on the rug. Again, the more movement, strange experiences, and senses you put into your memory palace, the better for your memorization.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This may seem like a lot of work, creating more information than the person needs to memorize. But the method of loci is actually a way of “hacking” the brain. To remember something, the brain needs a network of information. Without this network, the memory will fade quickly. The method of loci creates a new network. It uses multiple senses. And then, it attaches the network to something familiar. This way, what you are trying to remember enters the long-term memory.",

Interesting facts are easy to memorize. But information that can be used directly in someone’s life is even better. Imagine a history class. It is very difficult to learn the names of famous people who lived long ago. Event dates are difficult to remember. But if you were learning the history of another country where you were going to move, things might be different. It might be very important that you know the information.",

                    "People also learn better when they can connect the subject to something they already know. Imagine teaching someone to repair a car. If they have no experience with machines, it could be very difficult. But if they had worked on engines before, it would be easier. This is true of all subjects, whether it is language, art, or mathematics. We remember things that are useful to us. And if we do not have context, our minds will not recognize information. This is true even if you believe what you are learning is important. It might be very important to repair your car engine. But if you do not know the parts of an engine and what they do, you will not be able to learn. A good teacher will help connect new information to something you already understand. Or they will give you a wider base of knowledge to understand.",

                    "“Constructive criticism is something that should always be shared in private. Begin by telling the student the good things you see about him or her. This will get you started in a good way. Then, tell them what you think is delaying their progress. Then, tell them how they can make a positive change. After, remind them that you believe in them as an individual. If you share your concerns in the right way, it is possible that the student will do what you suggested.”",

                    "Finally, it is important to let your students be creative. They should not be afraid to ask their own questions. Much teaching in the past treated children as listeners only. Teachers gave students knowledge, and students accepted it. If a student could not learn, teachers decided the student was not intelligent enough. But today, we know that learning works differently. Students learn best when they believe they have the power to ask and explore. Sometimes, it is even good when they get things wrong!",

Then, you will forget it. But what if, instead, your teacher asks you how you would solve the problem? You might not know the correct formula. But you can guess and work it out yourself. You think about the problem for several minutes. When you finish, your answer might be incorrect. And your teacher will finally tell you the answer. But while you are working on the problem your attitude changes. The question becomes a puzzle. Now, you want to know the answer to this puzzle. You care about the answer.

But all people with anxiety have one similarity: an overactive amygdala. The amygdala is a part of the brain. It keeps emotions even and regular. It also tells the body when something dangerous is around. It causes the emotion of fear. In a healthy person, the amygdala does not activate much.

And it can hurt their lives, socially. One of these disorders is called obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD. A person with OCD has disturbing thoughts. These fears will not go away. But a person with OCD will try to get rid of them. She will perform particular actions to get rid of her anxiety. For example, if she is afraid of getting sick, she might wash her hands. But this does not make the fear leave. So she will wash her hands many times in a row. She will wash until her fears go away. Sam Wicky is a sculptor. He has OCD.

                    "Fear of Friday the 13th is mostly a Western tradition. It is even a part of popular culture. For example, there are some horror films called Friday the 13th. They are very violent and frightening. Many people watch them because they enjoy being frightened. In some of these movies, the violence begins on the day Friday the 13th.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Where does this fear come from? Experts believe that the fear of Friday the 13th comes from two separate fears that come together. They are the fear of the number 13, and the fear of the day Friday. Many people believe each separate thing is already unlucky. But when you combine them, they are even more unlucky!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are many stories about where the fear of Friday the 13th came from. Donald Dossey is a folklore historian. He studies ancient stories from many different cultures. Dossey tells National Geographic Magazine about the beginning of the fear of the number 13. He says the first writing about the fear of the number 13 comes from an ancient Norse story. Adam Navis tells this story:",

Loki liked to play tricks. He told another person to shoot an arrow at Balder. Balder died and the whole Earth got dark. The whole Earth mourned. It was a bad, unlucky day.”",

                    "In some traditions people refuse to serve a meal to exactly 13 people. They believe it is very bad luck. In France, there used to be people called “fourteeners.” People having a dinner party did not want to have 13 guests. So they would invite one more person to be at the table – a fourteener.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Some people also believe the number 13 is bad because of a story from the Christian Bible. 13 was the number of people at Jesus’ last meal before he died. His follower, Judas, was the 13th person to arrive at the meal. Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These things made people mistrust the number 13. Many high-rise apartment buildings and hotels do not even have a 13th floor. Most of these buildings go from floor 12 to floor 14. Or they use a different letter or number for the 13th floor. Many airports also do not have a 13th gate. Hospitals and hotels often have no room number 13.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But this fear of the number 13 is only one half of the fear of Friday the 13th. The other half of fearing Friday the 13th is a fear of the day Friday. The fear of Friday also comes from stories in history. Jesus was killed on a Friday. In the Christian Bible, and in other religious books, there is a story of a great flood that destroyed the earth. Some people say the flood rains started on Friday. Long ago, some people refused to start new projects on a Friday because of these stories.",

                    "“The British Navy wanted to stop sailors’ fear of Friday. They wanted to show them there was nothing to be worried about. So, they planned a new trip. They chose the sailors on a Friday. They launched the ship on a Friday. They named the ship the H.M.S. Friday. They even chose a man named James Friday to lead the trip as the Captain. Then, one Friday morning, the ship set sail for its first trip. It was never seen or heard from again.”",

                    "Even today, fear of Friday the 13th is common in Western cultures. Some research shows that more people go to the hospital on Friday the 13th. Some people refuse to even go to work. Some people try not to plan an important event like a wedding for Friday the 13th.",

They do not do all the business they would normally do.  Many of these people may not even know the stories about the history of Friday the 13th. They have a superstitious fear of the day. That is, they fear it for no good reason.",

And most of all, they can be prepared to take control of their future.”",

The reason may be death, illness, or even parents that are present, but too stressed. When this happens, the oldest child can become like the parent to the other children. The older child needs to learn about all the things a parent must do. A child is rarely prepared to do any of them.

It is your first day of work. Now, you are walking into your work place on the first day. You see your supervisor – the person who will be your boss and tell you what to do. Your supervisor reaches out a hand. Suddenly you are not sure what to do! Should you reach out your hand too? Should you say something or wait for your supervisor to speak first? What should you do?",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today’s Spotlight is on work culture. Each work place has its own culture. This culture guides the way supervisors and employees talk to each other. The values of a company influence a workplace culture. The culture of the country where you work can also influence work culture. Some people may move to a new country to take a new job. They may not know what to expect in a new culture. It can be difficult to know the right behavior in new situations. It can even be difficult to know the best way to communicate. In today’s program we share a few things people can do to learn the culture at their work place.",

                    "“People in the U.S. have many different kinds of jobs. Work culture and office environment may be different across different industries and different parts of the country. Even different companies in the same industry and in the same area may have different work cultures.”",

                    "Immihelp is a website particularly for people living in the US. But this idea is true no matter where in the world people work and live. Every work culture is different. So it is difficult to make or follow an exact list of rules that helps in every situation. However, there are some general methods people can follow to learn the culture of a work place. This advice can be helpful for any person starting a job. This advice may also be helpful to people who are experiencing problems at their current job.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Everyone who works should know the rules. When you begin working at any job, you can ask for the employee manual. Most work places make this list of rules. Read through the rules. They should tell you rules about taking holidays or vacation, policies about using the computer, and other helpful rules.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "An employee manual will also tell the dress code. The dress code tells what clothes are good to wear at that work place. Some work places require employees to wear a uniform.

                    "A written rule guide is very helpful. But many work culture rules are not written. One good way to learn a work culture is to observe your co-workers, the people that you work with. For example, observe how people greet each other. Is it different when a boss greets an employee? What happens when co-workers greet each other? It can be helpful to watch these greetings and then use them yourself.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "You can also learn other social rules from observation. For example, different cultures have different rules about how close to stand to another person. The website skillsconnect is for immigrants finding jobs in Canada. They write this advice on their website.",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“Watch your co-workers’ body language and change yours to fit in. For example, Canadians are most comfortable with 18 inches between each other when meeting or talking. Standing closer is considered rude and invasive. Standing further away appears that you are not interested in the other person, or that you are too shy.”",

Kumar studied computers there. Then he got a job in the United States. He noticed the work cultures of the two countries were very different. Kumar began a blog to tell other people from India coming to work in the US what they could expect. On his blog he says that a simple thing can help you gain trust from your co-workers.

                    "Kumar explains that while you are all eating a meal, you can talk about things other than work. You can talk about a person’s family or the things they are interested in. It is also a chance to ask about the culture you are in, and to share information about your own culture. Most of all, it is a chance to build a personal relationship.",

                    "The Museum of Failure takes its display of failed products from place to place. When you visit, you will see of some of the world’s most wonderful, and stupid, inventions ever sold. But the Museum of Failure is not only there so you can laugh at failed products. It also shows how very successful companies often fail – even companies like Apple, Amazon, and Twitter. And you can see how these companies learned from their mistakes. Today’s Spotlight is on the Museum of Failure.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Dr. Samuel West is a psychologist. He studies corporate behaviour – how and why large companies act the way that they do. He noticed that people do not like to talk about their failures. They cause us shame. But Dr. West believes that failures are important. Failure often leads to success. And, to make something new, it is often necessary to fail. Doctor West started the Museum of Failure so that people could talk about failure more openly. He spoke to the PBS News, about creating the Museum of Failure.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“If you explore new methods, new products, and technology, you will probably fail. In fact, ninety percent of new projects fail. This is the real obstacle to change. People are afraid of failing. I was thinking: “what can I do to communicate that we need to start accepting failure, rather than fear it?”",

                    "So, Dr. West began gathering failed products and telling their stories. At first, his collection was small. But soon, he gathered over 150 examples of failure. And he opened a museum in Sweden to display them.",

When you put it on, the mask would send small electric shocks onto different parts of your face. Its inventors claimed that the shocks from the mask would make people look younger. But wearing the mask hurt. The mask looked very strange. And there was no evidence that it worked. The product failed soon after its release.",

                    "This product seems like a bad idea from the beginning. But it does show the importance of trying. Many people have better ideas than the Rejuvenique mask. But they do not act on them out of fear. The Rejuvinique mask shows that making something new is easier than you think. If someone can fail as badly as this, the risk you are taking does not seem as terrible.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sometimes, though, these failures can have terrible consequences. One of the most important failures at the Museum of Failure is thalidomide. Thalidomide is a drug invented in the early nineteen fifties. Today, doctors use it to treat cancer and leprosy. But thalidomide has a dark history. When it was first released, its creators said it was a wonder drug. It helped people sleep. It treated anxiety and worry. It even helped with morning sickness, an illness that sometimes happens during pregnancy. Thalidomide was very popular, and it was supposed to be safe. In some countries, you could even get it without a note from a doctor.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the makers of thalidomide did not test it well. Or they ignored their tests. Thalidomide was safe for adults. But if a pregnant woman took it, the drug hurt the baby. Thalidomide causes serious birth defects in early pregnancy. It can damage a baby’s brain, its eyes, and its arms and legs. Many thalidomide babies were born with very short arms and legs. Many died. Doctors no longer give thalidomide during pregnancy. But over 24,000 children were hurt after the drug was released.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Thalidomide was one of the greatest disasters in medical history. But its failure did have some positive effects. Before thalidomide, companies did not have to report the results from all of their tests. There were fewer rules for what they had to test. After the thalidomide disaster, countries forced drug makers to test in more ways. Thalidomide hurt many, many people. But it also made the drugs we take today safer.",

                    "Some of the products at the Museum of Failure show that failure can even be the secret to success. Teflon is a chemical used in many different products. It makes surfaces very slippery. Nothing gets stuck to Teflon. So, people use it in non-stick cooking pans. It does not let electricity pass through it. A lot of electronic devices have Teflon in them. People also use it in electrical  wiring. And it can also make fabric resistant to stains and water.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But the creation of Teflon was an accident. Roy Plunkett was the chemist who created Teflon. He worked for the American company DuPont. He was trying to mix different chemicals. One night, he left some of these chemicals in a very cold environment. But, when he came to work the next morning, the chemical had changed. Instead of being a liquid, it had turned into a white powder. And Plunkett had no idea what it was.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Plunkett could have ignored the material. He could have thrown it away. But, instead, he decided to test the material. He spent six months trying to understand what it was. And interest in the chemical began to grow. Soon, Du Pont was making millions of kilograms of Teflon each year. Plunkett had made a mistake. But he was able to turn his mistake into great success.",

Summers claimed that men were more highly skilled in math and science. He said that people should consider that genetics could be the reason more men than women are in STEM work. Some people were so angry at this comment that they walked out of the conference! The next day, media around the world were talking about Lawrence Summers’ comments. It is true that fewer women than men have STEM work. But is genetics the reason? Could it be culture, or history? Are women able to be as good at STEM jobs as men?

These included the US, Korea, India, and Europe. They found that less than 30% of women study STEM subjects. However, the problem is even more serious.

                    "A man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.",

                    "If you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Bees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Bees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.",

                    "The day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.",

                    "The hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.",

So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.",

But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use.

But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.",

Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars.

Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!",

But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines. And they require less gasoline to operate.",

Many large car companies are researching this new technology. Right now, it is difficult to use hydrogen because it does not last very long. One tank full of hydrogen may only be able to fuel a car for a very short time. But people are hopeful that new technologies will help make hydrogen work in the future.",

It may be possible that there will be no single replacement for the internal combustion engine. In the future, there may be many different kinds of cars, each with different fuels. Or people may use cars less.  Either way, it is important to continue to invest in these new technologies. It is important not only for the future of the car, but for the future of humanity.",

For example, in 2016 there was a Maker Faire in Shenzhen, China. At the Faire people taught wooden knife making, drawing, and how to build a robot out of LEGO building bricks.

Repair Cafés began in Amsterdam, but have also spread around the world.

But Lasn began to question the ways advertisers influenced people to buy things. He also questioned the culture of buying. Was it good to make people feel like they should always want more and more? “Buy Nothing Day” criticizes this culture of consumerism.",

                    "Lasn recognizes that people need to consume things. They have to buy things to eat, live and even enjoy life. But Lasn believes that many companies encourage people to consume far more than is necessary. Advertising this way helps companies make money. But Lasn believes it hurts people and culture. Lasn told The Sun Magazine,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Companies have reduced us to consumers. They encourage us not to take part in society. We are just supposed to listen and watch advertisements and then buy. The media tells us that our desire to belong can be satisfied at any store, for the right price.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "So Lasn decided to use advertising against companies. Adbusters tries to help people understand some of the false values and ideas behind advertising. The main value Adbusters fights is the idea, “You must consume more to be happy.” And one way they do this is by encouraging people to celebrate “Buy Nothing Day!”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "“Buy Nothing Day” is celebrated on the fourth Friday of every November. Adbusters chose this day for a very important reason. It is the biggest buying day of the year. Advertisers call this day Black Friday.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Black Friday is particularly famous in the United States. It is the day after the country’s Thanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving, people in the United States gather with family and friends to eat a meal and give thanks. In recent years, stores began to reduce their prices the day after Thanksgiving. They wanted to encourage people to start buying gifts for the Christmas holiday in December.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "However, in recent years, Black Friday has become famous for something else: greed and violence. On Black Friday, stores offer extremely reduced prices. But they only offer limited amounts of product. So people come early in the morning – or even the night before – to stand in lines outside stores. Sometimes, people push or fight to be first into the store. Some people have even died in Black Friday riots!",

                    "“Buy Nothing Day” hopes to end the greed and violence of Black Friday. But its message is bigger than just Black Friday. “Buy Nothing Day” is for people in the United States and around the world. Many other countries also have growing problems with too much consumption. Sixty-two different countries, from Germany to Japan, already celebrate “Buy Nothing Day”. And the message is the same everywhere – buying too much hurts people, culture and the planet. The British “Buy Nothing Day” website explains,",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“Buy Nothing Day is a simple idea. It fights consumer culture by asking us to stop buying for a day. Anyone can do it if they spend a day without buying.”",

                    "For some people, “Buy Nothing Day” is a protest. For other people, it is a party. Some groups go to stores and encourage other people not to buy things. Other people gather together to make Christmas gifts instead of buying them. And some people use the day to create works of art that protest against consumer messages. Often, people celebrate by enjoying the free gift of nature. They go for walks or watch the sunset together. The only rule of “Buy Nothing Day” is not to buy anything!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Some people question if “Buy Nothing Day” can really change culture. It is only one day. And telling people not to do something often does not work! Other people say that consumers should not just buy less, but they should buy better. These people encourage consumers to buy things that are made in ways that do not hurt people or the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But “Buy Nothing Day” does get people thinking about the negative effects of buying too much. Kalle Lasn told The Independent news organization,",

So, they want a shoe they can remove easily. Babouches cover most of the foot. But they do not cover the heel, or back of the foot. This makes the shoe easy to put on and to remove.

                    "People apologize in many different ways and for different reasons. Some people say “sorry” more often than other people. And saying sorry is also cultural.

                    "People find all sorts of reasons to avoid saying “I am sorry”. They justify what they did. That is, they explain how it was the best thing to do. Sometimes a person who should say sorry only sees what the other person did. They point out what that person did wrong. People do this because saying that you are sorry means admitting that you hurt someone else. People do not like to feel guilty.",

                    "But what is a real apology? Many experts say there is more to a good apology than just saying the words “I am sorry”. There are several steps. The first step is to admit that you did something wrong. Be clear, not general. Name what you did. For example, do not say, “I am sorry I hurt you.” Instead, say, “I am sorry that I broke your glasses.”",
                    "Voice 1",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Next, you need to admit responsibility. You can explain why you did what you did. You can tell the other person that you were not trying to hurt them. But try to imagine what the other person is feeling. And take responsibility for what you did.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Finally, you need to tell the person that you will not do that thing again. Explain how you will change your behavior. This can help them rebuild the trust in your relationship.

                    "Also remember that sometimes, one apology is not enough. Sometimes, when a person is hurt very badly, or has lost their trust in you, it may take a long time for them to accept your apology and forgive you.",

                    "“An apology is a show of strength. It is an act of honesty because we admit we did wrong. It is an act of generosity because we are giving worth to the people we hurt. It offers hope for a new relationship, possibly even a stronger one. The apology communicates that we are serious about the relationship. Saying “I am sorry” is an act of courage because it opens us up to shame and the risk of feeling stupid, being rejected, and experiencing new pain from the person we hurt.”",

But here is the strange thing. One way they show each other love is to take their mouths and press them together. They may even put their tongues into each other’s mouth!

                    "Second, there are kisses of greeting. These kinds of kisses are different from country to country. They are governed by the rules of that culture. For example, in Argentina, when two people meet, they give each other a kiss on the right side of the face — the cheek. But it is usually not a real kiss. The cheeks touch and they make a small kissing sound. No lips or mouths touch at all.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In some places of Italy, people greet with not one, but two cheek kisses. They first kiss one side. Then they kiss the other side. In the Netherlands, people kiss three times: first one side, then the other, then back to the first side. And some places have even more complex rules about greeting kisses. People in many countries in the Middle East greet each other with a kiss. But this is not appropriate between everyone. An unmarried man and unmarried woman should not kiss. So what do you do if you are travelling and don’t know what to do? A good rule is: if you do not know what to do, do not kiss.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Scientists do not agree about why people kiss when they are in love. But there are many ideas. The first idea is that kissing helps us understand other people in a chemical way. When we kiss someone we get close to them. We smell their body and their breath. We taste their mouth. We feel their face. The fluids in their mouth carry chemical signals that may communicate to our brain if they are a good mate.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Most animals do not kiss. But they are much better at smelling things than humans. Humans need to be much closer to each other to smell. Melissa Hogenboom wrote for BBC.com,",

                    "“Humans have a terrible sense of smell. We learn a lot from getting close. Smell is not the only way we measure someone as a mate. But studies have shown that smell is an important part in choosing a mate.”",

                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Kissing appears to have two main uses. In the short-term, the kiss is more sexual. It serves as a tool for choosing a good sexual partner. In the long-term the kiss expresses a connection between people. It is a way to keep and build feelings of closeness in the relationship.”",

Women are more likely to think kissing is a way to connect with another person.",

                    "Kissing is not part of every culture. If you watch films and television, it is easy to believe that romantic kissing is part of life everywhere in the world.

Some of the people were victims of crimes. Other people were criminals. Brian took pictures of each person. Marina asked each person to tell their story.

Instead, he goes to his computer. And, he plays video games for the entire day Sometimes, his mother comes to bring him food.

                    "Japan has a very unique society. Traditionally, parents and children live together for many years. Several generations often live together at a time. And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.",

They have been hurt by their human relationships there. Other cases might be people who have had bad experiences at school.  Or, they have been through troubles, accidents, or illnesses. Some have stopped working to stay at home and look after their aging parents. There are many different reasons.

A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work. Or, they did not find work at all. This economic time period is known as the lost decades.",

They are in this middle place because they are not with people their own age. But they do not fit in with the parents, either. Parents look at them as a child. It is important for that sibling to talk with someone who is in a similar position, or to family members or friends. No one should have to take this work all on their own.”",

They would carry everything they needed. They planned everything well. But a few days into their hike, the family had no more food. However, they did have a book that identified which plants they could eat. They survived by eating plants they found. Boutenko explains in his book about finding food,",

                    "“Wild food grew everywhere along the trail, so it soon became the main thing we ate. By the end, most of our diet was wild plants. All of the new plants we used in our meals were fresh and very good for our bodies. We were amazed how much we enjoyed the flavor of our food and always looked forward to the next meal. In short, discovering wild food let us successfully finish our hike.”",

                    "This event started Boutenko’s love for finding food in nature. There are many people just like him in many parts of the world. They love to forage or search, for food. Foraging can save money, improve health, and change how people see the world. Today’s Spotlight is on foraging for food.",

                    "For most of human history, people did not get their food from a store. There were no large factory farms that put food in boxes and cans. People ate the food they grew on their own land. They hunted wild animals. And many people want to return to this way of living.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Foraging has become popular in recent years. People like Boutenko understand that there is food all around us. People have just forgotten how to see it.

                    "Voice 4",
                    "“There is a lack of connection in our modern lives. It cannot be replaced with the latest iPhone, dress, bag, shoes or party. Many people live and work surrounded by concrete and steel. They eat processed foods. This limits contact with nature. Eating and gathering wild food brings me to nature. I know when I am eating more wild food, I feel more alive. I think of food as the greatest medicine and wild food is full of so much goodness that it heals me from the inside.”",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Foraging can also change the way you see the world. When you can walk through a park or a forest and see food all around you, it changes you.

                    "If you want to start foraging there are a few steps you should follow before you start eating what you find. First, find an experienced forager. Not all plants are edible. Some can make you very sick. An experienced forager will help you know which plants are safe to eat.  Many places around the world have foraging groups or clubs. People in these clubs forage together. They share knowledge and information about what plants are good to eat and what plants to avoid.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Second, get a good guide book. A good guide book will identify all the edible plants where you live. It will have pictures of the plants. It will also tell you what parts of the plant you can eat. Plants have leaves, roots, stems, flowers and fruit. Just because you can eat one part does not mean you can eat all parts.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Third, learn the common poisonous plants in your area before you begin to forage. This will help you feel more comfortable foraging. And before you eat any plant you find, you should know it is completely safe to eat. Never guess if a plant is safe or not.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Fourth, use all of your senses to identify plants you find. Plants smell, feel, and look different from each other. Use all of these senses to identify a plant.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Finally, foragers must remember a few simple rules for foraging. Robin Shreeves wrote about foraging in Finland for the website Mother Nature Network. She suggested a few general rules to follow when you forage.",
                    "Voice 5",
                    "“For your own safety, know how to correctly identify edible plants. Many plants can be poisonous. If you are in an area that has been sprayed with chemicals, like a public park, the edge of a farm, or someone’s back yard – those wild plants could be covered with chemicals. Also, take only what you will use. Leave at least half, even if you could use more. Do not step on other plants to get to your desired food. And make sure you have permission to forage on the land. If you are on private property or publicly owned property such as a park or nature area, foraging may not be permitted. Finally, if a plant has damaged leaves, mold, dark spots or other signs of being unhealthy, do not eat from it.”",

Then, she places three scoops of tea for each guest into the tea bowl, or chawan. She puts the right amount of water into the chawan. And then she mixes it using a chasen. She needs skill to mix the powdered tea in the correct way – to make it become a thick liquid. Then she bows. She lifts the chawan with her right hand. And she places it on her left hand. She turns the chawan to the right three times, using her right hand.",

Alcohol addiction can cause people to lose their job, friends, or even their lives. But even in situations that are not as bad, alcohol can have negative effects. When people drink alcohol they do not make the same decisions they would if they were not drinking. People who drink alcohol are more likely to do risky things. This could include driving a car, fighting, taking drugs, or having sex. These risks do not always just affect the person drinking – they can affect other people too. For example, when a person decides to drink alcohol and drive a car, he or she could kill another person.",

Experts encourage people to drink in moderation. That is, they drink a moderate, or responsible amount. When people drink in moderation, it can bring people together. In 2012 Psychological Science published a study. They found that alcohol helped people in social situations feel connected to each other. It increased the amount of time people talked to each other. And it reduced the amount of negative emotions they expressed. Drinking alcohol with other people creates community in the same way that laughing, singing and dancing can.",

They are so small that we cannot see them. But some of them can cause disease.  Many dangerous micro-organisms live in soil, unclean water, animals and people. They can also live where we make food, especially if the places are dirty. Micro-organisms can move from one surface to another surface very quickly and easily.  Even a small touch can pass dangerous micro-organisms onto our hands, clothes, cooking tools, and cutting surfaces.  But if we keep everything clean, the micro-organisms do not get a chance to spread.",

                    "People should separate raw, or uncooked food from foods that are already cooked and foods that will not be cooked. People should store raw meat, chicken, and fish in containers, or in separate areas. Raw foods should not touch prepared foods. The WHO also says that people should use separate equipment and tools for touching and preparing raw foods. For example, if a person uses a knife to cut raw chicken, he should not use that same knife to cut a cooked piece of chicken. He should wash the knife, or use a different knife.",
                    "Voice 1",

                    "People should cook eggs and meat, like birds, seafood, and animals, especially carefully.  These foods may carry more micro-organisms than other foods. When meat is fully cooked the liquid from it will be clear, and not pink or red. People should boil food with a lot of liquid, such as soup, for at least a minute. That way, the pieces of meat and vegetables in the soup will be cooked completely. It is also important that people re-heat cooked food completely.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When food is completely cooked, the micro-organisms inside it die. Then the food is safe to eat. The WHO says that heating foods to 70 degrees Celsius makes sure they are safe. Thick pieces of meat like whole birds, must reach 70 degrees even in the middle. A thermometer can be very helpful to make sure that the food reaches the correct cooking temperature.",

                    "People should eat cooked food immediately, while it is still hot. It should be above 60 degrees Celsius if possible. And food should not stay out for longer than two hours. When people are finished eating, they should keep the food that is left cold. The food should be stored in a refrigerator, or electric cooling device, below five degrees Celsius. And people must not store food for too long in the refrigerator.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "At room temperature, about 20 degrees, the amount of micro-organisms can increase very quickly.  But temperatures above 60 degrees or below five degrees control the growth of micro-organisms. They cannot grow as quickly in a very hot or very cold environment.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "People should use safe water or treat the water to make it safe. People should choose fresh foods. They should wash any fruits or vegetables in clean water, especially if they do not plan to cook them. The WHO says that people should choose foods that have gone through special processes to make them safe.  For example, pasteurization is a process that destroys many harmful micro-organisms. Milk is often pasteurized to make it safe.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many dangerous micro-organisms and chemicals can live in places that people may not expect. Water and ice can look clean, but may still contain dangerous micro-organisms.  Damaged or old food may develop harmful chemicals called toxins as it gets older. In some cases, these toxins can cause death. This key also says that washing and taking the skin off vegetables can also reduce the risk of harm from micro-organisms.",

Then he shakes cinnamon spice and sugar over it. It is a sweet snack!  Another famous Mexican street food is Elote. This food uses corn on the cob. That is, the corn is freshly picked from the plant. Then, the vendor takes the rough covering off the corn. He pushes a wooden stick through the corn cob. He cooks the corn over a fire. Then, he covers the corn with a good tasting mayonnaise sauce. He puts spicy chilli flakes and cheese on the corn. Finally, he squeezes a sour lime fruit over it.",

This will press the liquids out of the shark’s body. It stays like this for six to 12 weeks. After the shark is cured like this, it is cut into long thin pieces. The pieces hang to dry for a few months. They develop a hard brown outer layer. It also has a particular smell. The shark meat is now fully fermented. The outer layer is cut off and the shark is cut into smaller pieces.",

They were small and dark brown. As he tested the beans he discovered a chemical inside them: caffeine. Today, caffeine is the most used drug in the world. Many people depend on caffeine to help them start the day. And more and more products contain caffeine. But there are negative results from using too much caffeine. How much is too much? Today’s Spotlight is on caffeine.",

Through history, people from all over the world have grown and used plants for the effect of caffeine. But today, people commonly get caffeine through coffee, tea, or soft drinks like Coca-Cola.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In a plant, caffeine is a natural pesticide – it makes insects unable to move and then kills them. But in a person’s body caffeine acts very differently. It speeds up a person’s central nervous system, inside the body. It stimulates the brain – that is, it makes a brain act and react faster. Some people feel that they can be more creative when they drink caffeine. It makes people feel more awake. And it can also increase physical performance in sports.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Caffeine affects a person quickly. Imagine a person who is drinking a cup of coffee. The drug begins to affect him about five minutes after he starts drinking it. In 30 minutes, the caffeine affects the person most strongly. After about four and a half hours, his body has used about half the amount of caffeine. And by the next day, the caffeine is gone. Caffeine does not stay in the body.",

People who try to stop drinking caffeine may be very tired, have muscle pains, or even have stomach pain. But these symptoms usually stop in about a week. Too much caffeine can also cause problems. People who have had too much caffeine may have head pain or stomach pain. They may have a rapid heartbeat. They may feel anxious, worried or nervous. Too much caffeine can make a person unable to sleep. But there are also more serious effects when people take extremely high amounts. These effects include a feeling of not knowing where you are, body movements you cannot control, or even death.",

And even though it increases blood pressure and a person’s heart rate, it does not seem to cause problems with a person’s heart.

The tea leaves are ready when all the water from the leaves is evaporated. There are many ways to prepare the leaves before making the tea drink. Some tea leaves are left open to the air before they are dried. This makes the leaves darker. They will taste stronger.

This was popular among wealthy people. They would drink tea and eat small sandwiches of meat and bread. This meal happened around three o-clock in the afternoon. The other meal was called “high tea.” High tea was a larger meal eaten later in the night. It was popular among poorer people.",

To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.",

Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce.

He begins to push and pull the dough, kneading it into a round shape. The sweet smell of bread fills the room. Then, after some time, he places the dough in an earthen tagine.

                    "Yeast is not an ordinary ingredient, like salt or pepper, or sugar or flour. Yeast is a very small living organism. It is a kind of fungus, related to mushrooms. You cannot see it unless you look at it through a microscope. Yeast feeds on sugars. When yeast eats these sugars, it produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is called fermentation. Carbon dioxide is what causes bread to rise. And the alcohol gives bread its special flavour.",

                    "There are hundreds of different kinds of yeast. Some are useful for making food. But others do not work as well. One popular kind of yeast makes a bread called sourdough.

Drinks made with yeast had a lot of advantages. Of course, people liked the effects of alcohol. But drinks made with yeast were also safer than water. In ancient times, drinking water could be dangerous. It could make a person sick very easily. But alcohol kills many of the diseases that live in water. So, you could drink it without getting sick. Many civilizations used this to their advantage. In ancient Greece, people mixed water with strong wine. This killed the bacteria in the water. And, because it was mixed, they could drink it most of the day without being drunk.",

Kefir is a fermented drink made from milk. It is from Eastern Europe. For most people, milk is very difficult to digest after childhood. This is because of a sugar called lactose, which most people cannot digest. But the yeast in Kefir breaks lactose down. Because of this, Kefir has almost no lactose in it.

                    "So, Don Raffaele created three pizzas. But he designed one pizza especially for the Queen. He added three toppings to the pizza. The first topping was mozzarella cheese. Mozzarella cheese was made from the milk of a water buffalo – a kind of local cow. It is a white cheese. The next topping was red tomatoes. Finally, Don Raffaele added basil leaves. Basil is a green plant with a mild spicy taste. These three toppings were white, red and green – the colors of the Italian flag. He called this pizza the Margherita Pizza. The Queen was very happy — she loved the pizza! And the Margherita Pizza is still a very popular kind of pizza today!",

You can mix different foods from different cultures and create something wonderful. Who would have expected that such an ancient and simple food would be popular today?

A person often makes a bias because he does not understand people from another group. Often, we do not know people who belong to different religious or racial groups than ourselves.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Second, you can educate your community leaders about hate. Help them understand the causes and effects of hate. Leaders may not understand that hate affects every member of a community. Hate is a serious community problem. When good leaders know the facts about hate, they want to stop it quickly.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Third, the SPLC says we need to demand that authorities react to a hate-based incident or a hate crime quickly and seriously. It is important that authorities completely investigate hate-based crimes. Local media like newspapers, radio, and television often report on crimes in an area. The media can show people the effects of hate. The media can encourage communities to accept other people no matter who they are or what they believe.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Fourth, expect leaders to speak against hate-based incidents strongly and publicly when they do happen. Leaders represent large groups of people. When a leader speaks against hate, she influences her listeners. She also influences her listeners when she speaks for tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means to respect every person equally. If a leader does not speak against hate, she is still sending a message. She sends a message that the community accepts hate.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Fifth, leaders must clearly name the problem. Sometimes it is difficult to speak clearly and openly about hate. Leaders may try to avoid using the word “hate.” Or they may try to forget about the problem. But forgetting about the problem of hate makes victims of hate crimes feel unsupported. A community without honesty becomes divided. It suffers. And it lets hate continue.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Lastly pressure your leaders when they do not act. Leaders in a community must be involved in the fight against hate. Ask leaders to be involved by speaking at peace events. Ask them to attend community meetings. Ask them to help create long-term ways to solve the problem of hate. Leaders who fight against hate have stronger communities. Victims in their communities feel supported. Whole communities feel safer. And they know how to react to future hate-based incidents.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These are all good ways to pressure your leaders to encourage tolerance. But what happens when a leader makes a racist comment? What happens when elected officials, police, or community leaders encourage hate instead of tolerance?",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The SPLC believes that community members have power to encourage, or pressure, leaders in that case too. The SPLC encourages community members to put pressure on hate-filled leaders. They say you can organize a group of people who believe in tolerance. Encourage your group to write letters to the leader. Encourage your group to organize public events. Leaders who encourage hate will damage their communities. Work to educate and communicate with these kinds of leaders in your community. Help them understand that leaders need to be involved in the fight against hate.",

You may have to work for a long time to get rid of it. This Spotlight program is about how to fight hate when the problem is too big or too deep to go away quickly. Big problems like discrimination and racial hatred may take a long time to heal. People must work hard to get rid of hate in their communities. That hard work may take a long time. People must look toward the future.",

But when people do not look at or deal with the problems, the problems seem bigger. They become more difficult to solve. And the future of the community looks frightening. This is especially true with the problem of hate in a community. So, the SPLC encourages communities to stay engaged. That is, it is important that communities do not give up in the fight against hate. They must plan for the community’s future.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The problem of hate does not usually come from outside a community. Instead, hate begins inside a community. Groups of people may blame each other for problems in the community. Or people may feel as if they have no voice in their community. They feel unsupported and powerless. Differences and change can cause fear. And fear can lead to hate.",

                    "Communities can deal with fear and hate. The SPLC says that a tolerant and united community can stand against hate.

                    "There are many ways to encourage children to celebrate differences in school. The SPLC even offers a Teaching Tolerance program.

They can look at how the media presents different races, religions and ethnic groups. They can decide if they agree with the films and television programs. Some films and television programs use stereotypes. That is, they present groups of people as being all the same. People can see the dangers of presenting a group of people using stereotypes.",

                    "These are just a few ways that the SPLC talks about teaching tolerance to children in school. But school is not the only place for children to learn tolerance.

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Every adult is a teacher to children. Children copy the actions and words of adults in the community. You can teach a child tolerance by being a good example for her to follow.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Acceptance is important for people of all ages to learn. You can examine your own thoughts and opinions. Are you tolerant of people who are different to you? Are there people in your community that you avoid, ignore, or try to forget? These things can be just as harmful as treating someone badly. We can all work to be more tolerant people.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Applause is a form of cheering. A group of people make noise at an event like a music show or a sports game. They sometimes make noise with their mouths.

Applause was a way for the crowd to say ‘thank you’ to the performers. But it was also more than this. People could also communicate how much they liked the performance. If they liked it very much they would applaud very loudly and for a long time. But if they did not like it, they would only applaud a little bit. In this way, a crowd could communicate as a group.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Applause also connected people to their leaders. Political leaders in ancient Rome gave long speeches to the people. And people could talk back through applause. Greg Aldrete is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. He studies politicians in ancient Rome. Aldrete told The Atlantic magazine that leaders would listen to the applause of the crowd. They would measure how long and loud it was. From this they would understand if the people supported them.",

                    "Politicians and performers even began to pay people to applaud loudly. They hoped that if the crowd heard people clapping loudly, they would all clap loudly too. In 17th century France, there was a group of people called the ‘claque.’ An actor or politician could pay them money. The claque charged money for different kinds of cheering services. They would clap and shout. The claque would even boo a performance. This showed that they did not like it.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Applause developed into a complex system of clapping and other noises. In this way, the crowd did not just watch the theatre or political speeches. They were able to be involved. Greg Aldrete explains some of the different ways a crowd could communicate:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Their ways of using applause included much more than clapping alone. Crowds made noises like thunder but they also buzzed. They also trilled. Crowds developed ways to express how much they liked the person or persons before them. They used claps, snaps of the finger and thumb and even waved the edges of their clothing.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In more modern times people stopped using this kind of complex clapping. It became more important for a crowd to know when to clap. For example, at some kinds of music performances, people should wait to clap until the end. This is good manners. Aldrete says:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Knowing when to stay silent, as well as when to clap, became a mark of education and class. It was a new kind of system for audiences to learn. Applause became a matter of “do” or “don’t,” “all” or “nothing”. It lost much of its old complexity.”",

They do not shout. And in America standing up to applaud is common. People stand immediately and make lots of vocal sounds – lots of shouting ‘Bravo.’ In Germany, you can actually count to three or five slowly after the music stops. Then the applause starts. It is almost like a spiritual feeling. They want to have that spiritual feeling or silence. And then they clap for much longer than anyone else on the planet!”",

In ancient Egypt, men would remove all their hair. Egyptians thought hair made humans more like animals. They would even remove their eye lashes – the small hairs over their eyes! In ancient Greek culture, beards were a sign of power, wisdom, and being a real man. Some Greek men would cut their beard off as a sign of mourning. Or they had to cut it off as a punishment.

Men who cannot grow a beard usually have normal levels of testosterone. They simply have genes that make it difficult to grow a beard. And yet, many people continue to think that a beard shows that a man is strong, able to have children, and would make a good mate. This leads to the other reason men grow beards.

And what it means to be a man or woman is changing in lots of ways. It makes sense that men would consider a beard as a way to think about being a man. It is a move toward the natural. I think that for a lot of men, that has got to be an important piece of what it means to be a man today – or maybe just a human being.

If a medical emergency comes up, the women can use this money to help their families.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Finally, Awamaki is helping to save traditional weaving methods. To weave their cloth, Quechua weavers use a backstrap loom. This kind of weaving is special to Quechua weavers. A weaver working with this loom will sit on the ground. One end of the loom attaches to a pole or stick in the ground. The other end of the loom attaches to the weaver by a strap around their back. The backstrap loom is very easy to carry. A weaver can roll it up and take it with her. If she is watching her sheep or llamas in the field, she can bring her loom. If she is visiting friends, she can bring her loom. Awamaki wants to protect this way of weaving.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Through Awamaki, the women also learn new weaving skills. They go on field trips to meet other weavers. By meeting other weavers, they have a chance to learn and improve their skills. Awamaki is also teaching the Quechua women how to use natural dyes. These dyes colour the cloth. In the past, Quechua people dyed all cloth naturally. They would use things like plants, insects, roots, fruits, and seeds. More recently, traders have been bringing new chemical dyes to the weavers. These dyes are cheap. They are also easier – the women do not have to take time to gather and prepare natural dyes.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "As a result, many Quechua women forgot or never learned how to use natural dyes. This tradition was about to be lost. But Awamaki trains their weavers to use the natural dyes again. The women are re-learning the old ways of dying wool. The natural colors are much softer, and more beautiful.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "These Quechua women are changing their lives. Their work is valued. They earn a fair payment for their weavings. And they can depend on this money each month. They are learning new dying, spinning, and weaving skills. They are able to take care of their families. Through Awamaki, they are building their community.",

She has a mask on her face to keep water out of her eyes. She dives deep down into the water. She does not have an oxygen tank. She holds her breath. The woman gathers shellfish from the bottom of the ocean. Then she swims back to the surface with her catch. She will do this up to 100 times this day. And she is 70 years old! This woman is part of the haenyeo. In Korean this means sea women. There are thousands of haenyeo on Jeju Island. Today’s Spotlight is on these strong women of the sea.",

                    "Jeju Island is mostly made of black volcanic rock. Before modern farming equipment, people could not grow much food here. So, they dove into the sea for food. Many creatures live in shells deep in the ocean. The people of Jeju ate and sold this shellfish to support their families. But by the 1600’s many men from Jeju left the island. They went to fight or to work on ships. The work of diving for shellfish became a job for women – the haenyeo.",

                    "The money earned from the haenyeo’s shellfish trade is a large part of Jeju’s economy. But being a haenyeo is also a way of life. They have a deep respect for the ocean. They also have a close connection to each other. And the haenyeo hold a special place in Korean society. Here, it is not common for women to do physical work as the main support for their families.",

Today, the haenyeo have diving masks and wetsuits. But these smell very strongly. And the women are often sick from the sea. Working in the ocean is also very dangerous. They dive up to six hours a day. The haenyeo must hold their breath for up to two minutes at a time. Diving can cause injury and even death.

But people there did not really celebrate Halloween until almost 100 years later – during the early 1900’s. For most children today in the US, Canada, the UK and other places, Halloween is about candy and fun clothes.

It is the ‘Festival of the Hungry Ghosts.’ The people there believe that spirits visit the world for 24 hours. Some people burn pictures of fruit or money. They believe that the spirits can see these burned pictures. And the burned pictures bring calm and peace to the ghosts. This celebration is not a time for games or dressing up.

It is a time to remember friends and family members who have died. A three-day celebration begins on October 31. During this time, families make special places in their homes to honour their dead friends and family. They place candy, photographs, fresh water, flowers, and food and drink in this special place. They burn candles and strong smelling incense to help spirits find their way home. The last day of the celebration is called ‘All Soul’s Day’.

They would wake up in the middle of the night to talk or pray or do quiet activities. But today, most people just have one sleep for about eight hours at night. However, there is no correct way to get enough sleep in a day. People around the world have different customs for sleeping at night, and during the day. Today’s Spotlight is on one particular sleep tradition called the siesta.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "This system began when Spain was an agricultural country. Many people worked outside in the field. These workers could not work well in the early afternoon. It was too sunny and hot. So they took a long break after eating lunch until it was cooler. But today, the economy of Spain is no longer mainly agricultural. People do not need to break when it is hot. But some people still take a break in the middle of the day.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Some people think that the siesta is a good custom. It gives people time to rest in the middle of the day. And there is some scientific evidence that taking naps can make people’s bodies and minds work better. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA did a famous scientific study in the 1990s. They studied how airplane pilots performed after they took naps and when they did not nap. NASA found that naps provided a 34% increase in pilot performance. Naps also provided a 100% increase in physiological alertness. Of course, not everyone needs to be as alert, or awake and able to react quickly as the pilot of an airplane! But many individuals, organizations and companies are interested in how to make people happy and able to work hard.",

                    "Even though a siesta might be helpful, it does not work for everyone. Some businesses do not let people stop working. Some people live far from the city and cannot go home during the day. Other people use the time to do small personal errands or shopping. The result is that a lot of people in Spain are not getting enough sleep.",

And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.",

A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work.

                    "Voice 2",
                    "South Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Rhinos are protected by the laws of the country. But people still hunt them. Some people think that the rhino horn has special powers. They will pay a lot of money for it. Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But even with punishments and armed rangers, the rate of rhino deaths in Kruger Park was still very high. Authorities needed another solution to save the rhinos. So they formed a new group in a nearby area called Balule Nature Reserve. This group has reduced trapping and poaching in their area by 76 percent!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This new force is made up only of women. They are named the Black Mambas after a deadly kind of snake. The Black Mambas do not carry guns. Instead they concentrate on protecting the animals and natural environment in the Park. Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Black Mambas. She explains to The Guardian why her group is so important.",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“There were men rangers carrying guns. But still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached.",
                    "I think they said, ‘Let us start something and add women and see what happens.’ Women are more loyal to their jobs. So they feel very strongly about what they do.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Since 2013, the Mambas have patrolled the metal fence which marks the Park area. They watch for poachers. They remove traps, or snares, set by poachers. And they report everything they see. The Mambas also go into the community. There, they educate people, especially children, about protecting animals.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "And the women of the Black Mambas have made a big difference. The Guardian says in the six months before they began, 16 rhinos were killed in Balule. In the year after the Black Mambas started, only three rhinos were killed. Siphiwe Sithole says:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“The Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching. We have zero acceptance of rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "People all over the world have noticed the Black Mambas’ success. The New York Times published pictures of them. They won an award from the UK organization Helping Rhinos. And the UN gave them the Champions of the Earth prize in 2015 for their courage. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Achim Steiner said:",
                    "Voice 5",
                    "“Their many successes are a result of their great courage and strong desire to make a difference in their community. The Black Mambas are an inspiration, not only locally, but across the world to all those working to stop the ugliness of the illegal wildlife trade.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Winning awards like this shows people that it is possible to prevent poaching. It also shows local people that the Black Mambas are valuable. Mamba Felicia Mogakane explains:",
                    "Voice 6",
                    "“It is about knowing that people in South Africa love and are thankful fo what we are doing. They are so happy that there are Mambas. Some years ago, they used to say this job is for men. Now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job. Jobs are limited in South Africa. So this is a big chance for me because I am able to take care of my family.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The Black Mambas are doing important work to save rhinos. But they are also doing important work in their communities. They are supporting their families by earning money. And people respect and honour them because of the work that they do. The Black Mambas show that communities and nature can work together. They bring hope for both people and animals in South Africa. We close our program today with the words of another Mamba, Collette Ngobeni, who share her hope for the future:",

They use food colouring to turn the water green! They use about 18 kilograms of this vegetable-based dye for the water. They do this to celebrate an Irish saint – Saint Patrick.",

And if you do not, someone may just pinch you. They may pull a little bit of skin between two fingers. But Chicago is only one place that celebrates Saint Patrick – people in cities and countries around the world celebrate him.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland. He is known for his religious work on that island. Historical church documents tell us some things about his life. But he also recorded his life and passion for his Christian faith in his letters.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Saint Patrick was bornin Britain around the year 386. At this time, the Roman Empire in Britain was ending. Violent groups from Ireland invaded the land. They stole land, money, animals, objects and even people. When Patrick was 16, people from Ireland raided his family’s home. They took Patrick and held him as a slave. He was kept in Ireland for six years. There, he worked as a shepherd and spent most of his time out in the fields caring for sheep Patrick wrote in his letters that he depended on God when he felt lonely or afraid.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "After being held for six years, Patrick escaped. In his letters, he writes that he had a strange dream. In the dream, he heard the voice of God telling him to leave. So Patrick left. He walked almost 322 kilometres toward the Irish coast. There, he was able to get on a ship to Britain and return to his family.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In Britain, Patrick studied to become a Christian priest. He lived with other religious men, as a monk. But then, Patrick’s writings say that he had another dream, this time from an angel. This angel told Patrick to go back to Ireland.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Historical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "He also added a circle to the common Christian cross. This became the Celtic cross or the cross of Ireland. The circle was the symbol of the sun. The sun was a powerful Irish symbol for many people. Patrick combined the circle and cross. This showed that Jesus was like the sun.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "St. Patrick is also closely connected to the green shamrock plant. It has three leaves. It is often used as a symbol of Ireland. Some stories suggest that St. Patrick used this plant to teach people the Christian idea of the Trinity – that God is three but also one.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But just how did the world start celebrating St. Patrick’s day on March 17th every year? That is because March 17th is the anniversary of St. Patrick’s death. He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day. Then they returned home to eat, drink and dance.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "As Irish people moved to other countries, the traditions went with them. The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was in New York City, in the United States, in the year 1762. Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.",

                    "In the 17-and 1800’s, large groups of Irish immigrants moved to the United States. This spread Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations to many communities there. But the United States and Ireland are not the only placed that celebrate this holiday. People in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Japan and Russia all celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. People have even celebrated this day on the International Space Station!",

Today, in the city of Dublin, about one million people take part in Saint Patrick’s Festival. This celebration is five days long! It includes parades, music, dancing, outdoor plays, fireworks and more!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In the past, Saint Patrick’s Day was mainly a religious celebration. Until the 1970’s, Irish law even said that the bars must be closed on March 17th. But now in most places, it is more a celebration of Ireland and Irish culture. But no matter why you celebrate, make sure to wear green on March 17th – or you may get pinched!",

But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.",

But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them!

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Tea comes from the camemellia senensis plant. People pick the leaves off the plant. They set the leaves to dry. The tea leaves are ready when all the water from the leaves is evaporated.  There are many ways to prepare the leaves before making the tea drink. Some tea leaves are left open to the air before they are dried. This makes the leaves darker. They will taste stronger. Some people mix tea leaves with flowers, oils, and other plants to give teas different tastes. The people who originally discovered tea developed these methods many years ago.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The story of tea begins in China. Chinese history says that over five thousand years ago, Chinese emperor Shen Nung discovered tea. Stories say that a dry leaf from the tea plant fell into the emperor’s cup of hot water. The emperor saw that his water turned dark. He tasted the water and liked it. This was the first cup of tea.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "However it started, tea became very popular in China. People believed that tea was healthy. People in China also created many different ways to prepare tea. In fact, a man named Lu Yu wrote a book just about tea, late in the eighth century.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Shortly after this, tea travelled to Japan. Japanese Buddhist priests travelled to China. And they brought tea back with them. In Japan, people developed special ceremonies to serve tea. Serving tea became a new form of art. It was most common among wealthy people.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Tea was an important part of both Chinese and Japanese culture. It had travelled to other Asian countries too. But tea had not yet travelled anywhere else in the world. Finally, in the late fifteen hundreds, Portuguese travellers brought small amounts of tea back to Europe. Portugal was one of the first European countries to trade with China. Portugal worked with the Netherlands to move the tea through Europe. Dutch ships took tea to France and other countries on the Baltic Sea.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Only very wealthy people had enough money to drink tea in Europe. It took many months to transport the tea from Asia. And only a limited amount was transported. But more countries started to trade with China. They also brought tea back to Europe. Prices became lower, and more people could drink tea.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today, England is the European country most known for tea. British traders started shipping tea to England in the late 1600s.Tea trade had become a very profitable business. England imported about 18,000 kilograms of tea a year in 1699. Ten years later, the country imported six times that amount of tea!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "British colonists also brought tea wherever they settled. Tea became very important in India. It is still a very important crop there. And Indian tea is known around the world.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Tea played an important part in one British colony you might know. This colony is now known as the United States of America. England sent tea to America. But, as time went on, England raised the taxes on the tea and other goods it sent. The people living in the colonies did not like these taxes. To protest the high taxes, a group of colonists took a large shipment of tea and threw it into the ocean. Today, this event is known as “The Boston Tea Party”. It was one of the most important events in the American Revolution.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Tea has also changed over many years. In the past, people drank tea by putting the leaves directly into the water. But around 1908 an American inventor developed a new method – tea bags. Thomas Sullivan put the tea in a small silk bag. This bag of tea could be put directly into the hot water.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "At first people in Britain did not like tea bags. But, during World War Two, people could not get their normal tea. So they had to use tea bags. Today most tea bags are made of paper. And they are very popular in many parts of the world.",

                    "Today, people on every continent drink tea. But people in different places drink tea differently. In the United Kingdom, tea became part of the daily meal.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Traditionally, two meals involved tea in British homes. These meals became popular in the 1600s [sixteen hundreds]. The first was afternoon tea – or “low tea.” This was popular among wealthy people. They would drink tea and eat small sandwiches of meat and bread. This meal happened around three o-clock in the afternoon. The other meal was called “high tea.” High tea was a larger meal eaten later in the night. It was popular among poorer people.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In Western Asia and the Middle East, a popular way to enjoy tea is as Masala Chai. Masala Chai is a drink made from black tea. But this drink has sugar, spices and milk in it.",

                    "Around the world people boil plants and flowers to make drinks similar to tea. These are called tisanes. A tisane is any drink made from hot water and any plant material, except from the tea plant. They are also often called herbal teas.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In areas of South America people enjoy a particular tisane. The drink is called Mate. People make it from the leaves of the yerba mate plant. A person puts dry yerba mate leaves into a dry gourd. This is a container made from a dried vegetable skin. He then adds water to the gourd. He drinks the liquid through a thin metal tube – a bombilla.",

                    "People in Southern Africa make a drink called rooibos. This hot drink is made similar to tea. But instead of tea leaves, it uses the leaves from the rooibos plant. The drink is a red color and is often called red tea.",

                    "More than five centuries ago, two armies fought a great battle. The battle ended years of civil war in England. On one side of the battle field was the army of King Richard III. On the other side was the army of Henry Tudor. Henry wanted to become king.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "During the battle, King Richard saw a chance to kill Henry. Richard rode his horse quickly toward Henry.  He killed many of Henry’s soldiers. But then, King Richard’s horse became stuck in the wet battlefield. The king fell. He fought hard, but there were too many enemy soldiers around him. The soldiers crushed Richard’s head and killed him. Later, they carried his dead body through the streets for all the people to see.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Religious leaders finally buried Richard’s body in a nearby church. But years later the church was destroyed. And Richard’s body was forgotten. Today’s Spotlight is on the recent discovery of Richard III’s body. This news about his death has caused many people to look again at his life.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Richard III was the last king of England to die in battle. His body did not receive honour. He was not buried in Westminster Abbey, the great Christian church in London where many English kings are buried. He was also not buried where he wanted to be. Richard wanted to be buried at his family home near the ancient city of York. Instead King Richard was buried in the city of Leicester, near the battle field where he died. And there he lay, forgotten.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Hundreds of years went by. The church building had been destroyed long ago. The city around Richard’s body had changed. No one knew where his bones were. Then, in 2012, a team of experts began a new search.  These archaeologists were looking for the body of King Richard. But they were not looking in a place that would honour a king. The team was digging under a car park, a place where people leave their cars.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Soon, the team found human bones. Immediately, they thought it was King Richard. They thought this because the skeleton’s spine was unusual.  This bone in the middle of a human’s back is usually straight. However, the spine they found was bent or crooked. And history books had long told of how King Richard’s spine was crooked.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The archaeologists wanted to be sure it was King Richard. So, they performed many tests on the skeleton. Many things proved that the bones were Richard III’s, including DNA tests.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "However, many people believed it was Richard just because of the reports about the crooked spine. For hundreds of years, people had remembered Richard for this. Artists painted pictures of Richard with one of his shoulders higher than the other. And writers told stories of ‘crooked’ Richard. However, crooked has another meaning too. For example, people say that criminals are crooked. This means that their character is not straight and honest.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many people say that Richard III was a crooked king – both in the way he looked and in his character. This is how England’s greatest writer, William Shakespeare, described King Richard. Over 400 years ago, Shakespeare wrote a famous play about Richard III. At this time, many people believed that a disability was a sign of evil. So Shakespeare made Richard even more disabled in his play. His character did not just have a crooked back. He also had an arm that did not work. In the play, Richard also murdered his brother. And he made secret plans to steal power.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Shakespeare’s play is not historically true. However, his work has shaped many people’s opinions of King Richard III. Shakespeare wrote his drama when the granddaughter of Henry Tudor ruled England. And here is the problem. Most of our information about Richard III comes from people who supported Henry Tudor and his family.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There is another famous story about Richard’s crooked character. This is not a story from literature. It is a mysterious story from history. But no one knows the full truth. It is the story of ‘The Princes in the Tower.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Richard’s older brother, Edward, had been king before him. He died, but his two sons were too young to rule the country. So Richard took his brother’s place. He was supposed to protect the young boys from their enemies. He was supposed to take care of the country, until his oldest nephew could rule.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the boy princes disappeared. They were never seen again. Richard became king instead. Followers of Henry Tudor said Richard killed his brother’s sons. Others believe that Richard cared for the boys, but that Henry had them killed when he became king. However, what exactly happened is still a mystery today.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "We do know some facts about Richard. Richard lived in a dangerous time. Powerful men spent much time plotting against each other. And he did have many of his strongest enemies killed.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But other facts do not match the stories about Richard’s crooked character. While his brother Edward was king, Richard was loyal to him. As a soldier, he fought for Edward in many battles. Richard also had a loving relationship with his wife and his own son.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "We also know that his people loved Richard. He gave money to universities and churches. He did many things to help the poor. This does not seem like the kind of person who would murder his brother’s children!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "We may never know the truth about Richard III. The history of his life seems to be crooked too! However, like all people, Richard was probably a mix of good and evil. This is exactly what Philippa Langley believes. Langley is a film writer. She has long believed that Richard was not as evil as many people think. She is part of an organization that defends Richard’s character. And she was one of the people responsible for finding Richard’s body. Langley hopes the discovery will create discussion about his life. Langley told the New York Times newspaper,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“The truth will turn out to be somewhere in between. Richard III was a man of his time. But what we know of him does not equal him being a vicious man and a purely evil killer. Now, we may be able to finally discover who the real Richard is.”",

People write emails, and text messages, instead of letters. In many places, people do not even use physical money to pay for things any more. All these technologies are replacing one of the most important materials in history: paper. Today’s Spotlight is on paper, its history and its importance in the world today.",

                    "Many people believe that paper started with the ancient Egyptians. However, this is not exactly true. Instead, 5000 years ago, Egyptians used a material called papyrus. They made papyrus from the stems of river plants. They put these flat pieces together, to create a larger flat sheet. Ancient Egyptians wrote on these sheets like paper.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the paper we know today did not exist until 3000 years later. It was created in China. Before the invention of paper, people in China would write on pieces of bone, bamboo or costly cloth. No one knows who first invented paper. But history does tell us about one man who improved the process. It was in the year 105. A man named Cai Lun began to experiment. He used many materials to make paper. He took bark from the outside of trees, pieces of net normally used to catch fish, and pieces of cloth rags. He broke these materials down into very small pieces. He put all these materials into a large container of water, to mix them. Then he removed this material, using a screen. When he pressed out the water, all that was left was a thin sheet of paper. He presented this new way of making paper to the Emperor. The Emperor was very happy and gave Cai Lun much money.",

From the Middle East, paper travelled to Europe and then the Americas. For many years paper cost a lot of money and time to create. But in the 19th century, people began to use steam powered machines to create paper from wood. Paper is still made from wood today in large factories around the world.",

Government officials would write important laws on it. Explorers drew maps of the world on it. But normal, common people did not use it. As paper became easier to make, it was used for more things. People wrapped it around gifts. Anyone could use paper to make notes and write down information. Paper was also used as money.",

But a lot of paper simply becomes waste, or garbage. It is burned for energy, or stored in large landfills. Paper does biodegrade, or break down over time but it does not happen quickly. As the paper breaks down it releases harmful gasses into the air. In the United States, paper makes up one third of all waste. In just that country, that is 85 million tons per year!",

But today, most paper comes from trees. Many of these trees come from very old forests around the world. Today, only 20 percent of the world’s ancient forests still exist. Around the world, every two seconds, people cut down more than 4,000 square meters of trees. And many of those trees became paper.",

                    "These ancient forests cannot be replaced. Forests provide oxygen for animals and humans. They store the gas carbon dioxide, which can cause global warming. Cutting down trees can also destroy environmental systems. The birds, plants and animals that live there may also die. Some companies plant new trees when they cut down forests. But it takes a long time for new trees to grow. Often, these newly planted trees are all the same kind of tree. This is called a monoculture. A monoculture forest can get diseases easier.

Each side on the Pyramid of Kukulcan has 91 steps. And there is one more step at the top of the pyramid. In all, there are 365 steps on the pyramid. This is the same as the number of days in a year.

Experts say that the observatory is one of the most complex structures the Maya built. A set of steps went up and around and around the observatory tower. The steps made the observatory tower look like a large shell – like a snail’s shell. The top of the observatory tower was a dome, that is, it was shaped like a half circle. And there were windows in the tower. Each window had a purpose. Experts believe that a person looking through one of these windows could see particular stars on particular dates. The Maya may have believed that studying the stars could tell them the future.",

Chichen Itza had the largest game area, or court, in Central America. The Maya probably played a game that was a little like football. Pictures of past games cover the walls of the ball court.

Using a credit card, a person borrows money from a bank, when he buys something. Then, at the end of the month, he pays the bank. This makes it easy to spend money! Money experts say that it is too easy. When people use paper money or coins, they spend less money. When they use a credit card, people spend more money – even too much money.

But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them!

It was a lighthouse. This tall building, a tower with a bright light at its top, would guide him. It warned those at sea to keep away from the rocks around it. With its light, the sailor knew where to sail to keep safe. Lighthouses like this have been guides for sailors for hundreds of years. But what is their future? Today’s Spotlight is on lighthouses.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Imagine a world without GPS or computers. How would you know where you are in the dark? Sailors depended on lighthouses for many hundreds of years. They were built on the coast, on islands, rocks, and even the sea floor. Lighthouses guided sailors. The lights showed sailors where to sail and where not to sail. But lighthouses also helped sailors to identify where they were. Each lighthouse was different. Each had its own colours and marks. And each lighthouse had its own system or pattern of light flashes. So sailors knew where they were just by looking at the lighthouse both in the day and at night.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Before lighthouses existed, fires on top of hills sometimes guided sailors. Later, people built towers to make the fires more noticeable.

                    "Experts say that the age of modern lighthouses began in the 18th century. In this period engineers improved the way that lighthouses were lit. Some lighthouses used coal fires to create the important light. Others still used wood fires. And some used oil lights or even wax candles. But all these forms of light produced smoke. And the smoke made the glass of the lighthouse black and dirty. When the glass was dirty, sailors could not see the light.",

                    "Over the years, lighthouses used different methods of shining a light out into the sea. But in every case, someone needed to look after the light in the lighthouse. Someone had to light it at night. Someone had to keep the equipment working. So, lighthouse keepers were needed. George Medlicott was a lighthouse keeper in the United Kingdom for 32 years.

                    "Often a lighthouse keeper had to live away from his family. But sometimes his family stayed with him. Ebonee Gregory had an unusual time as a child.

He felt that it was important to have a person in a lighthouse in case anything went wrong with the technology. As he prepared to leave his lighthouse home and job he talked with the BBC.

And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars.

                    "Harrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "It took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "However, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "So in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.",

In this case, luxury can represent high quality. Or it can also just represent the image of a particular brand name. The Oxford Dictionary defines luxury as both a state of being and as a thing. It says that Luxury is a state of living with ease and excess. And it says Luxury is a thing that is not needed, but desired, expensive, and difficult to get.",

                    "So why are luxury goods so popular, especially since they are difficult to get? One of the reasons is because they are so difficult to get. It makes people feel like they have status, or a high position, that other people do not have. The website Psychology Today states,",

                    "Luxury brand names want to stay exclusive, or only available to a few people. They encourage the sense that people who buy their products are better than others.

She wrote about her desire for luxury products. Brock travelled several times to Japan. There, she saw many women with expensive, $5,000 bags. Then, she wanted one. She wrote about it on her blog ProlificLiving. She said that buying particular brands is very popular in Japan.",

                    "The inequality of people living in poverty and in luxury is very clear. And it brings up an important question: is luxury morally WRONG? Is it wrong to spend 16 million dollars on a golden bed for a baby? Is it wrong to spend thousands of dollars on shoes? That money could buy food for very poor people. It could support schools. It could do many other things too",

Non REM and REM are the main sorts of sleep. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. In non REM sleep our eyes do not move much. But in REM sleep our eyes move quickly. We also dream most during REM sleep.",

People in Egypt also have an afternoon sleep called Ta’assila. Some tribes in Botswana and Zaire sleep when they feel like it – at any time of the day or night. People who live in Japan sleep less at night than people in many other countries. But the Japanese have developed a tradition of sleeping at work.

They say you should make sure that the place where you are sleeping is dark. Melatonin is a chemical produced by the body. This chemical helps control sleep. Melatonin reacts with light. That is why people find it much harder to go to sleep in a light room. The blue light from modern technology is a particular problem. Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard told the BBC,",

                    "HIV/AIDS has been a major world issue since the 1980s. The World Health Organization says that since that time, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV. About 35 million have died of HIV. Thirty years ago there was a lot of bad or false information about HIV/AIDS. But most people today know much more about the disease. They know that they cannot get HIV from just touching someone. The virus does not pass through sweat, saliva or urine. This improved information helps people react to the disease in a better way. So what is happening with HIV/AIDS in our world now?",

But in East and South African countries, the number of people with HIV/AIDS has gone down by nearly 30 percent since 2010.

Botswana has a government program that treats EVERY person no matter their age, sex or economic status. And they have seen particular improvement in one area: passing of HIV from mothers to their babies. The rate in Botswana has dropped from 40 to less than two percent! Many other countries have a similar drop in mother to child transmission. This is one of the major successes against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

By using ARVs correctly, people with HIV/AIDS can live long, productive lives. UNAIDS is the United Nations’ global effort to end AIDS. In a report, they said that for the first time, 53 percent of the people who need ARVs are able to get them. This is more than twice the number of people who were able to get them in 2012.",

Most of the cases of HIV/AIDs in countries like Russia and Ukraine are in particular parts of the population. HIV/AIDS is most commonly spread in this area by injecting illegal drugs.",

They give another group of people a ‘placebo’ medicine. The placebo looks exactly like the medicine but it is not. It does not contain any healing elements. The people do not know which medicine they are taking – the real one or the placebo. The medicine has to produce better results than the placebo to prove that it is effective.",

                    "The team performed a series of experiments. First the researchers showed a group of people unpleasant pictures, like images of dead bodies. The people rated how they felt after seeing the pictures. They gave the highest number to the pictures that gave them the worst feelings. The researchers then gave the people a calming drug. They told the people that the calming drug would reduce the unpleasant feelings from the pictures. When the team showed the pictures again, the people said that they felt much calmer.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "After taking the placebo, the people’s ratings still changed. Their unpleasant feelings reduced by almost 30%. It seems that taking the placebo made them feel calmer. During the experiment scientists also used special equipment to look at, or ‘scan’ the brain. They wanted to see if there was a change in the way the brains’ emotional centres were behaving. The scans showed that the brains’ emotional centres were more rested after the people took the placebo. The scientists claim that this is important new evidence. It means that placebos may reduce emotional pain. Dr Predrag Petrovic managed the experiment. He told the BBC:",

And some people have deep spiritual needs – which only God can meet. Dr. Palmer says that God is concerned with our bodies, minds and spirits – and that we should be too.

Their tongue may be very sensitive to sour foods. So the sour lemon is too much taste for them to enjoy. Other people may love coffee. They may NOT be very sensitive to bitter foods. So the bitter taste of coffee is a perfect balance. What you like to eat is based on your tongue. You may never be able to make someone love a food that you love.

                    "There is a lot of advice for pregnant women. Some of this advice is cultural. Different cultures offer different advice for pregnant women. Or it seems like there is too much advice. A pregnant woman may feel like it is all too much to do! But these tips are general. They are simple ways that pregnant women can be a little healthier.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The first tip for pregnant mothers is to eat good foods. A baby still living inside a mother’s body is called a fetus. The fetus gets all it needs from what a mother eats. For a baby to be healthy, it needs healthy foods as a fetus. Pregnant women should eat vegetables and fruits. They should eat whole grains like oats and rice. Protein is also important. It is found in foods like eggs, beans, nuts, and meats. It is also good to eat some cheese or yogurt.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "However, there are some foods pregnant women should avoid. Many health experts say that pregnant women should not eat unwashed foods, soft cheeses, or meat that is not cooked. These foods can contain harmful bacteria. This bacteria can cause the woman to lose important nutrients in her body. It can even cause the woman’s body to reject the fetus. Some experts also say that pregnant women should limit their caffeine. This is the drug found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks. Too much caffeine can result in the baby having unhealthy low birth-weight.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But the two things that women should ALWAYS avoid during pregnancy are smoking and alcohol. Smoking can result in early birth before the baby is ready. It can also cause the fetus not to grow properly. And pregnant women should avoid all alcohol. The Center for Disease Control in the United States writes on their website about alcohol and pregnancy. They say:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time during pregnancy to drink. All kinds of alcohol are equally harmful. This includes wine and beer. Alcohol in the mother’s blood goes into the baby. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, death, and several physical, behavioral, and mental problems.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "One thing a woman should drink while pregnant is clean water. Water is a good drink for all people. Water improves blood flow, skin health, and digestion. If a woman does not drink enough water during pregnancy, she may not produce enough breast milk. She may get a headache or feel more tired.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Another tip for a healthy pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin. These vitamins are designed to help pregnant women. Sometimes it is difficult for a woman to get all she needs through food. But a good prenatal vitamin will include iron for the blood, calcium for bones, folic acid for the health of the baby, and many other things.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "The next tip for a healthy pregnancy is to sleep a lot. It can be difficult to sleep during pregnancy. As the fetus grows inside the mother, it pushes her internal organs around. Woman can suffer from back pain and difficulty breathing. But sleep can help everyone. When people sleep enough, they reduce stress, build muscle, repair body tissues, and process things they have learned that day.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "A pregnant woman may have to try new things to be able to sleep. The best position for her to sleep in is on her side. Sleeping on her back or stomach can cause problems. A woman can use pillows or other soft things to get into a comfortable position. If possible, a woman’s partner should encourage her to sleep longer. He could take on a few more morning duties for her. Or he could encourage her to sleep during the day.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But even if a pregnant woman is sleeping more, she still needs to stay active and exercise if she can! This is the sixth tip for a healthy pregnancy. Exercise is good for most people. This is true for pregnant woman as well. It is important that women talk to their doctor before beginning any exercise program. Staying physically strong during the pregnancy can also help with the birth and recovery.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The final tip for a healthy pregnancy is to think about a plan for the birth of the baby. Labor is usually painful and can be frightening. Thinking about what the birth might be like can give a woman some control over what is happening. She can make a plan for how she would like things to go or about who she would like to be there.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "People cannot always control if there is a healthy birth or not. But there are things that women can do to have the most healthy pregnancy possible. And there are things their partners can do to encourage them in this work. A healthy pregnancy sets up a healthy baby. And a healthy baby can mean a healthy life.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "The first way to have a healthy childhood is to take care of the physical body. If a child lives in a dangerous situation, they cannot have a healthy life. Parents cannot stop all hurt and harm. Children often get hurt playing hard or falling down. This is one of the ways children learn about what is safe and what is not. But parents should work to keep children as safe as possible. Parents need to be careful around water, especially with young children. Other concerns are fire, guns, and knives. Children like to explore. But they should not explore things that could lead to injury or death.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Parents should also take children for regular medical tests. Doctors examine if children are growing. Doctors also give vaccines.

However, according to the United States Center for Disease Control website:",

                    "“Children ages three through five should be encouraged to move and be active. They should do things such as throwing games and bicycle or tricycle riding. To strengthen bones, young children should hop, skip, jump, and roll around. A target may be three hours each day. This can be all kinds of exercises: light, moderate, or fast. Children ages six through 17 years can achieve most health benefits by doing moderate and fast physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes or more each day.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Remember that most children learn by watching what adults do. If adults are eating good food and exercising, children will also want to do these things. And if adults around them smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol, children may do that. If adults spend hours looking at a phone, then children will want to do that too. Parents need to teach with their words. But they also need to show children with their actions.",

Any time you spend around your children can be a chance for connection. It does not have to be complex. With a baby, it could be as simple as 30 seconds of play or touching her toes. With older kids, it can just be taking time to stop and look at something your child is interested in. You can comment on it and see the world through her eyes. It could be playing a game — even a video game. Or it could be having a teenager show you what he is posting on Instagram. The important thing is to get on their level, be in their world.”",

                    "The human body is an amazing thing. It can fix itself. This is a miracle that most people do not think about. Julie K. Silver is a doctor who specializes in helping people recover after serious sickness or injury. She is amazed at how the human body works to repair itself after an injury. She wrote for AARP.com:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Your body works hard to help you recover. Even if you do little to help the process along. There is a lot happening in your body, both day and night, to help you to heal. When you are injured, white blood cells go to the injury to stop things getting worse. Other blood cells remove dead cells and help to control inflammation. If you break a bone, bone cells build the rough edges back together. There are so many cells assisting us in healing that we could never count them all. These processes happen on their own. But there are things smart patients can do to speed and strengthen their recovery.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "So what are these things that can help people heal faster and better? The first and best thing you can do is to sleep more. Everyone knows that a good night of sleep makes you feel great. But scientists in many different fields of study believe sleep helps in growth, recovery, and mental health. Most healthy people are not getting enough sleep. And Dr. Silver says that people recovering from an injury need even more. She says,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“If you are like most people, you need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. During sickness you may need more rest than that. Your body’s healing processes require sleep to work. For example, your body produces the chemical melatonin when you sleep. This chemical increases your immune system and helps repair your body. It may even help prevent some forms of cancer. But if you are not sleeping enough at night, your melatonin levels can be reduced.”",

                    "The next tip for recovering after injury is to continue to move in healthy ways. Do not make the injury worse. Many athletes continue to exercise and play sport when they are injured. They do not know the difference between pain from effort and pain from injury. In these cases, they may need total rest. But many experts say that light activity can help people heal faster. In fact, a study from 2005 showed that wounds healed faster when people moved.",

                    "Researchers from Ohio State University in Columbus studied a group of older adults from ages 55 to 77. All the adults were healthy. During the study, about half of the adults exercised three times a week for three months. The other half did not exercise during this time. Each person in the study also received a small but deep wound on the upper part of their arm. Researchers took pictures of the wound over time as it healed. And the adults recorded their exercise. At the end of the study, researchers discovered something amazing. The wounds of the people who exercised healed about ten days faster than the wounds of the people who did not exercise.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The next tip to recover after an injury is to eat good food and drink enough water. Food is the first medicine. What we put in our bodies becomes our bodies. Foods like fish, eggs, and yogurt can help with broken bones. Meat, nuts, and seeds can help our blood. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C. Vitamin C helps people stay healthy and heal from cuts on the skin. Eating good food is important for all people. And it is very important when recovering from a sickness or injury.",

                    "The final tip to help recover after an injury is to work on the mental parts of recovery. An injury often requires us to change the way we live. This can be frustrating. We want to be able to live at the same fast speed that we always did. But an injury can make us slow down. Carrie Cheadle is a professor of sports psychology at John F. Kennedy University. She told Outside Magazine how people cannot deny what it will take to recover. She says:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“You should not ignore the frustration and sadness that come with injury. But you should look at all the good things in your life. Let yourself have some joy. It makes you understand that everything is not horrible. It is often as simple as focusing on something that makes you happy that is not exercise or sport. You may even try keeping a journal and writing down three things you are thankful for every night. This can help move your thoughts away from your injury.”",

Erik Erikson was a famous psychologist. He developed a series of steps of human life. Kendra Cherry wrote about Erikson’s work for the website VeryWellMind.com. She writes:",
                    "Voice 4",

They can face the end of life with a sense of wisdom and no regrets. Erikson defined this wisdom as an “informed and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself.” Those who feel proud of their achievements will feel a sense of wholeness. These individuals will get wisdom, even when looking at death. Those who are not successful during this time of life will feel that their life has been wasted. They will experience many regrets. This person will be left with feelings of bitterness and no hope.”",

Throughout life, a person learns a lot of different skills. Some skills are learned at work. But some skills are learned through hobbies or other life experiences. A person can use the skills he has learned to improve the community around him. A person can discover meaning and purpose to life when they find a way to add to their community. It is also a good way to help those people that they care about.",

In some parts of the world, half of the people who got sick with smallpox died. But doctors in Europe had found a way to protect people from getting smallpox. They infected people with a similar virus called cowpox. Cowpox did not make people as sick. When they got better from cowpox, their bodies knew how to protect them from getting the smallpox virus too.",

But all people with anxiety have one similarity: an overactive amygdala. The amygdala is a part of the brain. It keeps emotions even and regular. It also tells the body when something dangerous is around. It causes the emotion of fear. In a healthy person, the amygdala does not activate much.

But a person with OCD will try to get rid of them. She will perform particular actions to get rid of her anxiety. For example, if she is afraid of getting sick, she might wash her hands.

                    "A man is in his kitchen. His name is Seamus Blackley. In front of him is a large, flat wooden board. Blackley covers the board in a special powder. It is a kind of flour made from a grain called einkorn. This is one of the oldest forms of wheat. Then he takes a large ball of dough from a bowl. He begins to push and pull the dough, kneading it into a round shape. The sweet smell of bread fills the room. Then, after some time, he places the dough in an earthen tagine. And he puts it into a hot place to bake. The dough begins to bake. Soon it will be a large loaf of bread.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But this is no ordinary bread. Blackley is making the bread with ancient grains and ancient methods. But Blackley is also using a special yeast. The yeast will make the bread rise or expand. But this yeast is not the kind people normally use. This yeast is also ancient. Using a special process, Blackley took the yeast from Egyptian baking bowls. It is the same yeast used 4,500 years ago!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Yeast is one of the most important ingredients ever discovered. People use it to make bread, alcoholic drinks, and fermented foods. People have been using yeast for almost 10,000 years! Today’s Spotlight is on the history of yeast.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Yeast is not an ordinary ingredient, like salt or pepper, or sugar or flour. Yeast is a very small living organism. It is a kind of fungus, related to mushrooms. You cannot see it unless you look at it through a microscope. Yeast feeds on sugars. When yeast eats these sugars, it produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is called fermentation. Carbon dioxide is what causes bread to rise. And the alcohol gives bread its special flavour.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are hundreds of different kinds of yeast. Some are useful for making food. But others do not work as well. One popular kind of yeast makes a bread called sourdough. Sourdough has a special, tart flavour. Other yeasts make alcoholic beverages. Koji is a yeast used in Japan. The Japanese use it to make a drink called Sake. But there are even yeasts that people do not use much. These are called wild yeasts.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Humans first started using yeast in food before people invented writing. Experts think the first use of yeast was probably an accident. Wild yeast probably fell into a sweet drink. And the drink started to ferment. When people tasted it, they found it was good. So, they took some of the drink, and used it to make more. They were taking yeast and growing more, though they did not know it. These were the first brewers.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "From this point, yeast began to change. People began breeding the yeast. If they made something that they liked, they would repeat the process. And they started breeding different yeasts for different things. The yeast began to specialize. Kevin Verstrepen is a scientist at the University of Leuven. He studies yeast genetics. He spoke to Science Daily about this process.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Sometimes, early brewers had a very good fermentation. They were smart enough to harvest the yeast. They used it to start the next batch, even if they did not know what was in it. Reusing the yeast to make beer separated it from nature. The yeasts were changing in the brewery.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Remember Seamus Blackley from the beginning of this program? When Blackley started making his bread, he was excited because of these changes. The Egyptian yeast was a lot like sourdough bread. But what was yeast like almost five thousand years ago? Blackley did not know what it would taste like. When he finally tasted his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter about his experience.",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“The bread is light and full of air, especially for a loaf made from these ingredients. The smell and flavour are incredible. It is very different. You can easily tell the difference, even if you are not excited about bread.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The first evidence of people using yeast comes from China. The ancient Chinese made a drink called Kui. They used water, honey, rice, and fruit. Drinks made with yeast had a lot of advantages. Of course, people liked the effects of alcohol. But drinks made with yeast were also safer than water. In ancient times, drinking water could be dangerous. It could make a person sick very easily. But alcohol kills many of the diseases that live in water. So, you could drink it without getting sick. Many civilizations used this to their advantage. In ancient Greece, people mixed water with strong wine. This killed the bacteria in the water. And, because it was mixed, they could drink it most of the day without being drunk.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But making foods with yeast also makes them more delicious and healthier. These are fermented foods. The yeast breaks down sugars that may be difficult to digest. Kefir is a fermented drink made from milk. It is from Eastern Europe. For most people, milk is very difficult to digest after childhood. This is because of a sugar called lactose, which most people cannot digest. But the yeast in Kefir breaks lactose down. Because of this, Kefir has almost no lactose in it. The yeast makes milk safe for people who cannot drink milk!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many ancient people also used yeast to help in food storage. Fermenting foods in this way is called pickling. Fermenting, or pickling, makes food last longer. But it also changes the flavor. Kimchi is one of the most famous pickled foods from Korea. Kimchi is fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radish. In ancient times, people made kimchi so that these vegetables would last through the winter. But soon, people began to make kimchi because they liked the taste.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today, we do not need yeast to clean water or to preserve food. But over the years, humans have developed a taste for fermented foods. We eat them now because we like them! We continue to make them because they are part of our traditions. And they connect us to people who lived thousands of years ago. When he made his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter:",

                    "Voice 2",

People who are rhesus negative cannot receive blood from people who are rhesus positive. Hospitals are very careful not to give people the wrong blood type.",

It changed everything at the time.”",

                    "Doctors used the antibody they found to develop an injection. The injection is called Anti-D. It is the only known way to fight rhesus disease. And the donor that Falkenmire is talking about is James Harrison. Anti-D can only be made from the blood of particular donors like him. Doctors give injections of Anti-D to pregnant women at risk of rhesus disease. This stops the mother’s body from attacking the baby’s cells. Then there is a much better chance of having a healthy baby. Millions of women need these injections. But only a few people have the antibodies needed to make Anti-D in their blood.",

                    "In some places in the world they do not even have the choice of receiving Anti-D. In many countries there is not enough information about rhesus disease. In 2018, researchers Zipursky, Bhutani and Odame did a study. They looked at rhesus disease as a major public health problem in developing countries. They published an article in The Lancet. It states that rhesus disease is the cause of death of over 150,000 babies every year, worldwide. They hope that there will be more global research about this important issue.",

The Sydney Morning Herald reports that in Australia, there are only around 150 people able to give blood to make Anti-D. And about 17 percent of Australian women are at risk. So James Harrison has been an important part of the blood program there for 60 years. Robyn Barlow is the Rh program coordinator. She first asked James to donate his blood for this cause.

It is a race started as a celebration of human ability. But it limited that celebration to only a few until the 1970s. Now it is a race that shows the best of what South Africa has to offer. By doing that, it permits South Africans to compete against the very best in the world. More importantly, the Comrades puts such mental and physical demands on its runners that differences of race, ethnicity, gender and class are meaningless.

At night they sat around their open fire with their many children. “Mama” the children cried. “Sifuna izindaba! We want stories! Tell us some stories, mother!” Manzandaba would think and think.

Her grandmother stretches out her arms to receive the little girl.",

The story encourages them to help people in need.",

                    "Unconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God’s love and heaven – especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day — heaven.",

Superheroes with amazing powers used to keep the United States safe. But now, most superheroes have retired or lost their power. People in the United States are afraid. They fear nuclear war. They worry it could happen at any time.

                    "Early graphic novels started in the 1930s as comic books. A comic book tells a short story with pictures and few words. Each page of a comic book includes several squares with pictures. The pictures show what is happening in the story. The pictures also have words with them. These words express what the characters are saying or thinking. And each picture tells the next part of the story.",

                    "At first, comic books were like magazines. Each monthly comic would include a small part of a larger story. Often these stories were about superheroes or other non-human characters. People would have to wait each month to read the next part of the superhero’s story. But in the 1970s, publishers began creating longer comic books. They did this by putting together the stories from all the comic books in a series. Soon, writers wrote longer and longer stories using comic book design. They called these longer books graphic novels.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Graphic novels combine two kinds of storytelling – writing and narrative or story art. Sometimes, a writer can have a good story idea, but she wants to tell her story with more than just words. So she creates pictures of her characters.  These pictures show what a character looks like.  But they can also show what the characters are doing.  By combining pictures and words, the writer can show special details. She can also tell a more complex story with fewer words.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Like all stories, writers create graphic novels for many reasons. Some graphic novels teach a moral lesson. Some are just for fun. And others help readers learn about other people, times and cultures. Not all graphic novels are about superheroes. In fact, some of the most famous graphic novels are true stories. They are about events and situations that happened to real people.",

They must imagine what happens between the pictures and few words the writer provides. They must work harder to understand the story. And for many readers, this helps them remember the story better.",

                    "The Quechua people live in the high Andes mountains in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile. They live a simple life. It is centred on farming and family. They raise sheep. But they also raise many kinds of camelid animals – llamas, alpacas, vicuña, and guanacos. They use these animals for food. But they also use their hairy wool to make clothing and art.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Each kind of camelid animal has a different kind of wool. Llama wool is very rough. They use it mostly for making rope or bags. Vicuña wool is very soft, but can only be harvested every few years. However, people can harvest alpaca wool often. This fine wool is softer and warmer than sheep wool. Baby alpaca wool is the softest and most valued alpaca wool. It is used for fine clothes and scarves for warmth.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The Quechua people also use the wool from these animals to make weavings. Then, they use these weavings to make warm clothes, pieces of art, blankets, and more. The images in Quechua weavings are shared through generations. A weaver repeats images again and again in a weaving. Weavers choose images for their meaning and history. These images include animals, plants, gods, people from history, water, and the stars. The image may not be clear immediately. For example, the whole animal may not appear. The weaver may only show the marks from its feet. A talented weaver combines many different images.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Awamaki is based in the town of Ollantaytambo. Ollantaytambo is in what is called “The Sacred Valley” of Peru. This area is high in the Andes between Machu Picchu and Cusco. More than 500 years ago, it was part of the Incan empire – this people group ruled a large area stretching through many countries in South America. Ollantaytambo is a beautiful example of a traditional Incan town. People still use the original Incan walls, farming terraces, and irrigation channels, used to bring water to farms and villages. Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists come through this area each year. They want to see these Incan places, and the Quechua people. Many women in this area weave traditional cloth. And they sell the clothes and other products to tourists. But in the past, they did not get fair prices for their work. They did not know the best things to sell to tourists. And this is how Awamaki helps.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Awamaki has four main goals. First, they want to make sure the tradition of Quechua weaving continues. They are helping the Quechua women bring their work to the market, and get a fair price.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Second, Awamaki wants to help the women sell their work around the world. They sell the traditional weaving and clothes over the internet. But Awamaki also connects the women with clothing designers in other countries. They work together to make new and interesting designs.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Third, Awamaki also wants to improve the lives of the weavers, their families, and their communities. The women of Awamaki have a regular income. They can depend on earning money each month. The money earned also goes back to their communities. Some of the money is saved in a medical fund for the women and their children. If a medical emergency comes up, the women can use this money to help their families.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Finally, Awamaki is helping to save traditional weaving methods. To weave their cloth, Quechua weavers use a backstrap loom. This kind of weaving is special to Quechua weavers. A weaver working with this loom will sit on the ground. One end of the loom attaches to a pole or stick in the ground. The other end of the loom attaches to the weaver by a strap around their back. The backstrap loom is very easy to carry. A weaver can roll it up and take it with her. If she is watching her sheep or llamas in the field, she can bring her loom. If she is visiting friends, she can bring her loom. Awamaki wants to protect this way of weaving.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Through Awamaki, the women also learn new weaving skills. They go on field trips to meet other weavers. By meeting other weavers, they have a chance to learn and improve their skills. Awamaki is also teaching the Quechua women how to use natural dyes. These dyes colour the cloth. In the past, Quechua people dyed all cloth naturally. They would use things like plants, insects, roots, fruits, and seeds. More recently, traders have been bringing new chemical dyes to the weavers. These dyes are cheap. They are also easier – the women do not have to take time to gather and prepare natural dyes.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "As a result, many Quechua women forgot or never learned how to use natural dyes. This tradition was about to be lost. But Awamaki trains their weavers to use the natural dyes again. The women are re-learning the old ways of dying wool. The natural colors are much softer, and more beautiful.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "These Quechua women are changing their lives. Their work is valued. They earn a fair payment for their weavings. And they can depend on this money each month. They are learning new dying, spinning, and weaving skills. They are able to take care of their families. Through Awamaki, they are building their community.",

But he remembers many happy days on these hills. When he was a child, he ran over the grass and climbed trees. But when he was young, nobody called him Isadore Charters. The only name he knew was Yenmo Ceetza. His family called him Yummo. But one sad day, officials took Yummo away. They placed him in a government school, far away from his family. And they called him Isadore Charters. Officials took Charters away from everything he knew. And it has taken him many years to find peace and recover from this hurt.

Officials took Charters and his brothers. They put the boys in the truck. The truck was filled with other crying children. All the children were from first nations tribes. And the government was placing them in government managed residential schools – far from their homes. The Canadian government threatened the native parents.

From 1876 to 1996, the Canadian government forced 150,000 first nations children to attend residential schools. The goal of these schools was to force native children to become part of the majority culture. School officials worked to rid Canada of first nations culture.

Over time, Charters struggled with the idea of becoming a Christian. The school was managed by Christian leaders that did not respect him or his culture. But he believed strongly in God, and he wanted to become a saint – a holy person of the Christian church. So one day, he got on his knees. He placed his back toward the school and his face toward the grass of the fields. He told God that he wanted to become a Saint. Charters told Spotlight,",

He made pictures of snakes coming out of peoples’ mouths and pictures with knives and blood. After a short time, Charters began to drink alcohol. He thought alcohol would help get rid of his pain. By the time he was 12 years old, Charters was an alcoholic. He could no longer control his use of alcohol.",

He also points out that even unique national foods are made of ingredients. Each of these ingredients come from somewhere different. For example, the caprese salad is a very Italian dish.

                    "Imagine a painting of two women. They have the same face. But one is wearing a white European-style dress. The other wears a traditional Mexican skirt. You can see both of their hearts. And a single blood vein connects them. The woman in the white dress has cut a vein with scissors. Her dress is stained with blood. The women are holding hands. Behind them, there are dark clouds, like a coming storm.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This is a painting called The Two Fridas, by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. This is a painting of herself. She painted it after she and her husband divorced. It symbolizes the pain and longing of this lost relationship. Kahlo often painted herself. But she did not just paint what she could see. Her painting expressed what she felt, with symbols. Using these symbols, she was able to paint about disability, love, and the traditional Mexican life. She is still an important artist today. Today’s Spotlight is on Frida Kahlo.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Frida Kahlo was born in Mexico, in 1907. She began painting when she was very young. But she did not think of it as a job. Instead, she wanted to be a doctor. She even attended school to become a doctor. But when she was 18, she was in an accident. Kahlo was riding on a bus. The bus driver crashed into an electric train, going full speed. The crash hurt Kahlo very badly. She broke her legs, foot, pelvis, and collar bone. Worst of all, a metal rail speared her through the stomach. It shattered parts of her spine. And it made it so she could not have children. Because of the crash, she lived in pain for the rest of her life.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Later, Kahlo would paint about her pain. One of the most famous of these paintings is called Broken Column. It is another self-portrait. In it, she is naked from the waist up. Small, white tears fall from her eyes. All over her body, nails stick out from her skin, though there is no blood. But this is not the strangest part. From her neck to her waist, there is a huge gash. It looks as if it has been left by an earthquake. Inside the gash is a tall, stone column. It is like those that hold up old houses. And the column is broken into pieces. A yellow desert stretches off behind her.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The crash destroyed Kahlo’s body. She would never be a doctor. But the crash also gave her time to paint. And, in 1928, she met Diego Rivera. Rivera was a famous Mexican painter. He painted murals. In making a mural, a person paints directly onto a wall. Rivera’s murals were very large, public pieces. They showed the indigenous people of Mexico and industrial workers. Kahlo asked Rivera what he thought of her painting. He wrote later about that first meeting with Kahlo. He said her paintings: “had a deep honesty, and an artistic personality of their own.” He said it was clear “that this girl was a true artist.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Rivera encouraged Kahlo’s painting. And soon, they fell in love. They married in 1929. Together, Kahlo and Rivera traveled the world, painting. But the marriage was not easy. Both of them had many affairs. They often lived apart. They divorced, and re-married. But they also loved each other deeply. Once, Kahlo wrote to Rivera in a letter:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Nothing compares to your hands. Nothing is like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from you.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many of Kahlo’s paintings are about their troubled relationship. In 1943, she painted Diego on my Mind. It is another self-portrait. In this painting, she wears a traditional Tehuana costume. This white robe wraps around her like a butterfly’s chrysalis. Strange, white threads stretch out from her body. It is like they are holding her in place. And on her forehead is a picture of Rivera. Kahlo painted this after their divorce. It shows that, even though they were apart, she was still thinking of him.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Kahlo did not find immediate success as a painter. Rivera helped her meet many people. And after a time, she began to show her paintings in galleries. But many people did not take her seriously. They did not believe her art was there because of her skill. They believed she found success because her husband was famous. In 1938, Kahlo went to New York. She had her first solo exhibition. The gallery only displayed her paintings. But the news media did not treat her with respect. A writer for Time Magazine saw the exhibition. He said that Kahlo’s paintings were weak. He did not like the bright colors. And he compared her paintings to ideas of a child.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But soon, people began to recognize Kahlo’s work. The Louvre is a famous art museum in Paris, France. In 1939, the museum bought one of Kahlo’s Paintings. The painting was called The Frame. The Louvre had never purchased a painting by a Mexican artist before. It was a great achievement for her to be the first. Other artists also encouraged Kahlo. André Breton was a French writer. He called her art “a ribbon around a bomb”. He helped her find places to show her work.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But Kahlo was most famous in her native country, Mexico. This is partly because she used images from Mexican culture. For example, one of her paintings is called The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl. The painting shows the universe as a mother. This woman holds Kahlo and Rivera in her arms. From those arms grow the plants of Mexico. The painting also shows Cihuacoatl  holding her. Cihuacoatl is a goddess from Aztec stories. The Aztecs were one of the original peoples of Mexico. And Cihuacoatl was their mother goddess. By including Cihuacoatl, Kahlo shows a motherly love for her husband. But she also shows that her mother is Mexico. It is the thing that gives her life.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Just as Kahlo was becoming more famous, she began to get sick. Her health was always bad. But it began to get much worse. The pain in her back made it so she could not stand or sit long. In 1953, doctors removed one of her legs after an infection. She lived either in a bed or a wheelchair. And she abused medicine to manage her pain. Later in the next year, she got sick from pneumonia. This made it hard for her to breathe. She had a terrible fever and was in a lot of pain. She died in 1954. She was only 47 years old.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In the years since she has died, Frida Kahlo has become very famous. Her paintings are world-famous. In 1984, the Mexican Government even declared that her paintings were part of their national heritage. Women celebrate her for her fearless images of female life. But more than anything, people remember her for her talent and special vision. As Rivera once wrote to the Spanish Painter Pablo Picasso:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“I recommend her to you, not as a husband, but as an admirer of her work. It is acid and tender. It is hard as steel and fragile as a butterfly’s wing. It is as lovable as a beautiful smile, and as cruel as the bitterness of life.”",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Like many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.",

                    "William Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“",

But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Blake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:",

                    "“I attempted every morning for two weeks to follow your directions. But I found all of my attempts were unsuccessful. So, I decided to show an independence that I know will please you better. I will not follow the path of another, however wonderful that path may be. At any rate, my excuse must be: I could not do anything else. It was out of my power!”",

                    "But though Blake was not wealthy, he continued to make his own art. He created his own way of engraving on copper. And, he began writing poetry. Blake created many books of poetry. And, he would make images to go along with his poems. Some of these books were about the future as Blake imagined it.",
                    "Voice 2",

                    "Mozart died in 1791. He was only 35 years old. There was a false rumor about his death. It said that someone poisoned Mozart. But today, experts believe he probably died of a common infection or sickness. He was buried in a place for people who do not have much money. Since it was a common grave, it was not marked with a stone just for Mozart. So, even today, no one knows where Mozart is buried.",

Richard Taruskin is a music teacher and writer. He wrote about Mozart for the New York Times. He argued that for many people, listening to Mozart’s music became a sign of being wealthy, educated, and high-class. But he does not think this should be. He believes that everyone should listen to Mozart. In his article, Taruskin shares a quote from another famous music composer. It is the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.",

A much bigger man kicked sand in his face. Angelo felt shame. He was so small that he could not fight back. He knew he could not win the fight. So he decided to change his body. He decided to get stronger.",

                    "There were not many exercise programs or classes for him to join. And he did not have enough money to pay for training. So Angelo started exercising by himself, in his own home. He started by lifting things that were heavy and making his own equipment. But this method was not very successful. And he did not have money to buy more equipment.",

                    "Then one day he visited the zoo. He watched the lion’s strong muscles as it moved. He understood that the lion was getting stronger as it stretched its body. This gave Angelo the idea to change how he was exercising. He would add stretching and call his program Dynamic Tension.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Dynamic means movement. And tension happens when two things oppose, or are against, each other. Angelo’s system combined moving and stretching, tightening muscles for tension, and breathing. It did not require any equipment or weights. It used the weight of a person’s body to create strength. Today, this method is commonly called isometrics.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Angelo practiced Dynamic Tension for a few months. As a result he was no longer small and weak. He was big and strong. His friends noticed his new body. They told him that he looked like a statue that was on the top of a local hotel. It was a statue of Atlas. Atlas is a god from old Greek stories. The story says that Atlas was so strong that could hold up the whole earth on his shoulders. Angelo liked this name. So he changed his name to Charles Atlas!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "With his new body, Charles Atlas began posing as a model for many artists making statues. Around this time, he also took part in competitions to find the “World’s Most Beautiful Man” and the “World’s Most Perfectly Developed Man”. He won both titles. Soon after this, he decided to make his success into a business. He found a business partner and started to sell his exercise plan. Now other people could become strong and well-developed just like him.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Charles Atlas wanted to show people that his method really worked. He often demonstrated his strength. He worked in travelling shows. He lifted heavy weights. He balanced on his hands. The writer Jerry Cowle described meeting Charles Atlas at a summer camp.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“First he tore a thick paper phone book in half. Next he bent an iron bar into a horseshoe shape with just his hands. Then he put a long iron bar in his teeth and had two men hang from it, one from each end. Finally he lay on a bed of sharp nails while the same two men stood on a piece of wood across his chest. We all cheered. Atlas deserved the title ‘World’s Most Perfectly Developed Man’.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Atlas made his Dynamic Tension exercises into a 12-week program. He used his own story to sell the program. Young boys read about the program in the back of comic magazines like Superman, Batman, or Spiderman. The comic story advertisement showed a small boy getting sand kicked in his face. Then the boy did Dynamic Tension. He was then able to defend himself.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Charles Atlas never stopped building his business. He performed acts of strength often. He also cared about the people who bought his program. Many people liked that Atlas himself would write to people who bought the program. And he never stopped working to improve the program. He continued to make new and better exercises.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "By the 1950s, Atlas had sold over a million copies of his exercise program. People from all over the world bought it. They wrote to thank him for changing their lives. The program was translated into seven different languages. For the next 20 years it was the most popular exercise program in the world. In fact, people can still buy it today!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Atlas also believed his success came because of how he lived his life. He did not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. He encouraged people to go to church. He told people to get up early in the morning. He thought it was important for boys and girls to keep their rooms clean and organized. And even though he was a wealthy man, he lived in a simple home with his family.",

Atlas’ Dynamic Tension program is just one of many exercise programs. But Charles Atlas showed the world that you do not need complex equipment to become strong. You do not need to pay someone lots of money to teach you to be healthy. All you need is your own body, hard work, and clean living.",

                    "Matt Stutzman was born in 1982. When he was born, he did not have arms. He was disabled, but he was healthy in every other way. When Stutzman was 4 months old, his parents decided that they could not care for him.  They wanted someone to adopt him. So, they surrendered their parental rights. They hoped that other parents would care for their son – and make him a part of their family.",

They taught him to work hard. And even though he had a disability, they encouraged him to try and do anything he wanted to do. Jean Stutzman wrote about Matt’s story on the website mattstutzman.com.

Stutzman believes this has helped him succeed at many things in life – including archery. Today, Stutzman lives a completely un-adapted life. He has not changed anything in his home or car to make it easier for him to live without arms. He also does not use prosthetic arms – arms created by doctors and scientists.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "So Stutzman had to teach himself. He learned to hold the bow with his feet. He also learned to use the side of his mouth to guide the release of the arrow from the bow. It is an unusual method for shooting a bow and arrow. But Stutzman believes that his lack of arms is helpful in archery. He told the MSNBC news organization,",

And in September of 2012, he won a silver medal award at the London Paralympic Games. Stutzman hopes this is just the beginning of his success. He told the KCCI news organization,",

She founded TNI in 1999. It began as a place where girls who ran away from FGM and early marriages could continue their education.

                    "One of TNI’s programs involves different ceremonies for girls to become women. As a member of the Maasai tribe, Pareyio knows how culturally important FGM is for many women. She wants to offer another choice that protects young girls from FGM but still honors Maasai traditions. The traditional ceremony for Maasai girls to become women is four days long. The girls dress in their best clothes and wear their most beautiful jewelry. They sing traditional songs, and tribal leaders bless the girls with milk and water. A leader performs FGM on the girls. And at the end of the ceremony, the community welcomes them as women.",

She wondered if the accident might have been God’s answer to her prayer. Tada began to study the Christian Bible. She read what God teaches about pain, suffering, and healing. Tada says:",

Outside, the city of New York was full of lights. These lights were the result of an idea the old man had had many years before. This man was once famous for his idea.

As a young boy, Tesla had a dream or goal. He knew about the great waterfall, Niagara Falls, in the United States. At Niagara Falls, a large river flows over a cliff. It drops more than 50 meters! Tesla wanted to turn this great waterfall into electricity. This was not a normal dream for a young boy. But Tesla was not a normal boy!",

He too was experimenting with how to best transport the power of electricity. But Tesla worked for Edison for less than a year. Tesla was sure his AC motor was the best way to capture and transport the power of electricity. However, Edison thought his way of using direct current or DC was better.

It was more powerful than DC and it was proved safe.",

And after Tesla’s death, the United States courts decided that Marconi did use Tesla’s ideas. But by this time people had forgotten about the debate.

They opposed the state-approved Nazi church. When pressure from the government increased, this group changed. They became the illegal Confessing Church. The Confessing Church believed that Christians should follow God first, not the nation or Hitler. Bonhoeffer served as the head of the Confessing Church’s school.",

But Bonhoeffer began to hear stories of Jewish people being killed and his ideas changed. He decided that pacifism was a good theory, but to not act was to act. If he did not act, he was letting Hitler win. If he did nothing to fight the evil he saw, he was supporting the evil.",

                    "So he went home. He could not support Hitler’s government. But he could not do nothing. He believed that killing was wrong, but he also believed it was wrong not to help people in trouble. During this time, he spent a lot of time thinking and writing about the correct thing to do as a Christian. After a time, he decided to join a group planning to kill Adolf Hitler.

He was on the floor praying to his God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed. He believed and was so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a prayer. Then he climbed the steps to the gallows. He was brave and calm. He died in a few seconds. In the almost 50 years that I have worked as a doctor, I have never seen a man die so completely accepting of the will of God.”",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Achebe was born in Nigeria in 1930. His full name was Albert Chinualumogu Achebe. His parents named him in honor of Prince Albert, in England. Achebe’s father was a teacher in a missionary school. And his parents were strong Christians. But they also taught him many values of the surrounding traditional Igbo culture.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Achebe was a skilled student. At university he studied English, history, and theology, or faith. He also studied broadcasting. At university, Achebe also rejected his given British name, Albert. Instead he took his middle name – an African name – Chinua. After university Achebe travelled in Africa and America. He also worked in radio and was a teacher.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But in 1958 Achebe made a permanent mark on the world. He wrote a book called “Things Fall Apart.” Today this book appears in more than 50 languages. It has sold more than 11 million copies. This book began a new kind of writing about Africa.",

                    "“Things Fall Apart” is the story of a very successful African man. His name is Okonkwo. In the story, Okonkwo is a leader in his village. But after a terrible accident, he must leave his village. “Things Fall Apart” tells about Okonkwo’s life. It tells Okonkwo’s religious beliefs and his traditions. It tells about his children, and the way the people in his village live.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This seems like a very normal story. And it is a very normal story. That is why it is so important. The characters in the book are very real.  Achebe showed the world what African people really felt, and said, and how they acted. This was a very new way to write stories about any African people.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Achebe writes stories about Africa for a particular reason. For a long time, Achebe was interested in language. He listened to the people around him in Nigeria. They loved language. He heard them speak with “great eloquence.” They spoke beautifully. But Achebe did not see the same sort of eloquence and beauty from African people in modern literature of the time.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "A popular writer of the time was Joseph Conrad. One of his most famous books is called “Heart of Darkness.” He wrote it in 1902. The story tells of a European man and his travels in parts of Africa. In those days many Europeans called Africa ‘the dark continent.’ Many believed that African people were not intelligent. They looked at them like animals. They believed the ceremonies and traditions of the Africans were foolish, and even evil. Some people believed that Joseph Conrad’s book showed Africans in this way.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Achebe tells about the longest group of words said by an African character in ‘Heart of Darkness.’ The character says only eight words. And he is not very eloquent. The African man says: “Catch him! Give him to us! … Eat him.” The African man who says this is a cannibal. He is looking for someone to eat. In other parts of the novel this man does not even speak. He shouts in high tones like an angry bird and makes animal noises.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Achebe saw this short speech as an insult to the people of Africa. So, he wanted to do something different. In an interview with Lorene Cary at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Achebe tells why he wanted to write a book about his people. He says:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "The people I was writing about wanted their story told. They people of my village wanted their story told. I wanted my story told. I was very young, but I had begun to read other people’s stories. And I was beginning to wonder: where was mine?”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Achebe believed that no one had told the real story of the real people of Africa. Africans in literature did not seem human. These stories lacked the beautiful language Achebe heard around him. And he felt that taking away this language took worth away from Africans. He told Lorene Cary,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“When I am talking about my story, giving me back my story, I mean giving Africans back the story in which we are human. No matter how damaged or bad we are as humans. We cannot give language to some people and take it away from others. … That is what “Things Fall Apart” is about. What I say must be true. I cannot act as if the Africans I am writing about are angels – that they are perfect. They are not. I have to say that they are human… I lived in the village and I knew the people of the village. They were not people without language.”",

                    "Achebe’s books test old ways of thinking about African people. He believes that language and literature greatly influence people. In the past, bad representations of Africa and Africans influenced people all around the world. These bad representations even influenced Africans themselves. They started to believe they were not as modern or as good as white European cultures. But Achebe writes books to show the African cultures as they really are. He educates foreign readers. And he encourages African readers. He helps his people understand how valuable their culture is.",

He influenced many artists who came after him. But Van Gogh was also unwell. He suffered from mental illness all his life. He died without much money, at a very young age. Few people knew about Van Gogh when he was alive. But today, he is one of the most well-known artists in the world. Today’s Spotlight is on the life and illness of Vincent Van Gogh.",

When he was young, Van Gogh did not impress many people. He had mood swings. Sometimes he was very happy, and sometimes he was very sad. These emotions were very strong. They often annoyed family and friends. He was not able to control these emotions. And the people who loved him did not know what to do.",

But the church did not accept him. He often lived without much money. And he sometimes lived on money that his parents gave him.",

Later, Theo invited Vincent to live with him in Paris. Living in Paris was very important to Van Gogh. That was where many other interesting artists lived.

                    "But Paris was also where Van Gogh’s mental illness really began. He had always been very emotional. Often, he was very depressed. He abused alcohol. He especially drank an alcohol called absinthe. But in Paris, things began to get worse. Sometimes, he would become terrified for no reason. At other times, he would lose consciousness. He would forget where he was.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "After a few years, Van Gogh tried to leave Paris. He found a house in a town called Arles. He hoped leaving Paris would help him get better. Instead, it made things worse.",

                    "Paul Gauguin was a famous artist. He lived with Van Gogh in Arles. Van Gogh admired Gauguin. He wanted to work with Gauguin. But Gauguin began to dislike Van Gogh. They fought often. Van Gogh told his brother, Theo:",

Later that day, he approached Gauguin with a razor blade. Van Gogh did not hurt him. But Gauguin felt threatened. He left soon after. That night, Van Gogh began to hear voices, even though he was alone. They tortured him. To make them quiet, he picked up the same razor blade. He cut his own ear off! Then, he went to a brothel. He gave his ear to a prostitute. Then, he disappeared.",

During this time, Van Gogh made some of his most well-known paintings, like the painting described at the beginning of the program. He painted similar things to other artists, like flowers and fields. But the way he painted was very different. He did not just paint these things. He painted what he felt about them. And he used colors in ways no one had seen before. People began to recognize his works.",

He felt so strongly and loved what he did. He fought through many years of difficulty, and changed the world of art. But Van Gogh did not see this. He died thinking he had failed.

It symbolizes the pain and longing of this lost relationship. Kahlo often painted herself. But she did not just paint what she could see. Her painting expressed what she felt, with symbols. Using these symbols, she was able to paint about disability, love, and the traditional Mexican life. She is still an important artist today. Today’s Spotlight is on Frida Kahlo.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Frida Kahlo was born in Mexico, in 1907. She began painting when she was very young. But she did not think of it as a job. Instead, she wanted to be a doctor. She even attended school to become a doctor. But when she was 18, she was in an accident. Kahlo was riding on a bus. The bus driver crashed into an electric train, going full speed. The crash hurt Kahlo very badly. She broke her legs, foot, pelvis, and collar bone. Worst of all, a metal rail speared her through the stomach. It shattered parts of her spine. And it made it so she could not have children. Because of the crash, she lived in pain for the rest of her life.",

                    "Later, Kahlo would paint about her pain. One of the most famous of these paintings is called Broken Column. It is another self-portrait. In it, she is naked from the waist up. Small, white tears fall from her eyes. All over her body, nails stick out from her skin, though there is no blood. But this is not the strangest part. From her neck to her waist, there is a huge gash. It looks as if it has been left by an earthquake. Inside the gash is a tall, stone column. It is like those that hold up old houses. And the column is broken into pieces. A yellow desert stretches off behind her.",

                    "The crash destroyed Kahlo’s body. She would never be a doctor. But the crash also gave her time to paint. And, in 1928, she met Diego Rivera. Rivera was a famous Mexican painter. He painted murals. In making a mural, a person paints directly onto a wall. Rivera’s murals were very large, public pieces. They showed the indigenous people of Mexico and industrial workers. Kahlo asked Rivera what he thought of her painting. He wrote later about that first meeting with Kahlo. He said her paintings: “had a deep honesty, and an artistic personality of their own.” He said it was clear “that this girl was a true artist.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Rivera encouraged Kahlo’s painting. And soon, they fell in love. They married in 1929. Together, Kahlo and Rivera traveled the world, painting. But the marriage was not easy. Both of them had many affairs. They often lived apart. They divorced, and re-married. But they also loved each other deeply. Once, Kahlo wrote to Rivera in a letter:",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many of Kahlo’s paintings are about their troubled relationship. In 1943, she painted Diego on my Mind. It is another self-portrait. In this painting, she wears a traditional Tehuana costume. This white robe wraps around her like a butterfly’s chrysalis. Strange, white threads stretch out from her body. It is like they are holding her in place. And on her forehead is a picture of Rivera. Kahlo painted this after their divorce. It shows that, even though they were apart, she was still thinking of him.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Kahlo did not find immediate success as a painter. Rivera helped her meet many people. And after a time, she began to show her paintings in galleries. But many people did not take her seriously. They did not believe her art was there because of her skill. They believed she found success because her husband was famous. In 1938, Kahlo went to New York. She had her first solo exhibition. The gallery only displayed her paintings. But the news media did not treat her with respect. A writer for Time Magazine saw the exhibition. He said that Kahlo’s paintings were weak. He did not like the bright colors. And he compared her paintings to ideas of a child.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But soon, people began to recognize Kahlo’s work. The Louvre is a famous art museum in Paris, France. In 1939, the museum bought one of Kahlo’s Paintings. The painting was called The Frame. The Louvre had never purchased a painting by a Mexican artist before. It was a great achievement for her to be the first. Other artists also encouraged Kahlo. André Breton was a French writer. He called her art “a ribbon around a bomb”. He helped her find places to show her work.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But Kahlo was most famous in her native country, Mexico. This is partly because she used images from Mexican culture. For example, one of her paintings is called The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl. The painting shows the universe as a mother. This woman holds Kahlo and Rivera in her arms. From those arms grow the plants of Mexico. The painting also shows Cihuacoatl  holding her. Cihuacoatl is a goddess from Aztec stories. The Aztecs were one of the original peoples of Mexico. And Cihuacoatl was their mother goddess. By including Cihuacoatl, Kahlo shows a motherly love for her husband. But she also shows that her mother is Mexico. It is the thing that gives her life.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Just as Kahlo was becoming more famous, she began to get sick. Her health was always bad. But it began to get much worse. The pain in her back made it so she could not stand or sit long. In 1953, doctors removed one of her legs after an infection. She lived either in a bed or a wheelchair. And she abused medicine to manage her pain. Later in the next year, she got sick from pneumonia. This made it hard for her to breathe. She had a terrible fever and was in a lot of pain. She died in 1954. She was only 47 years old.",

                    "In the years since she has died, Frida Kahlo has become very famous. Her paintings are world-famous. In 1984, the Mexican Government even declared that her paintings were part of their national heritage. Women celebrate her for her fearless images of female life. But more than anything, people remember her for her talent and special vision. As Rivera once wrote to the Spanish Painter Pablo Picasso:",

Now his body would be buried. But the woman preparing his body was about to be very shocked. When she removed his clothes, she discovered that Doctor Barry was not a man. Doctor Barry was, in fact, a woman.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today’s Spotlight program is on the amazing story of Doctor Barry. By acting like a man, she was able to become a doctor. And as a doctor, she saved many lives and achieved great success.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "So who was Doctor Barry? Well, she was born over 200 years ago – as Margaret Bulkley. Her father owned a small business in Ireland. When Margaret was young, the family began to have money problems. Margaret’s father could not pay his debts. So officials sent him to prison",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "After that, Margaret and her mother had almost no money. So they travelled to London.  They hoped to find work and make enough money to keep them alive.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Margaret wrote letters to her mother’s brother.  She asked him for help. She hoped her uncle would help her achieve an education. Sadly, he was not very kind to her. But, after his death, some of his friends were kind. They helped Margaret get an education.  And she was an excellent student.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It is unclear exactly what happened next. But together, Margaret, her mother and her uncle’s friends prepared a plan. They decided Margaret would study to become a doctor. But, at that time in Britain, only men could become doctors. So Margaret would need to make people think she was a man.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This was a major decision. Margaret would have to lie.  She could not tell anyone her secret. Margaret decided that being a doctor was worth it. So Margaret put away her young woman’s clothes. And she began to wear the clothes of a young man. She and her mother left London. They sailed to Scotland where no one knew them. There, Margaret would start medical school.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Margaret would no longer be Margaret Bulkley. Instead, she called herself James Barry – the name of her dead uncle. Only three other people knew Margaret Bulkley’s secret. And these friends provided money and support for her medical studies.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When Margaret finished medical school, she joined the British Army. There, she became a great surgeon. She skilfully operated on people’s bodies. And she saved many lives.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Around the year 1815, the Army sent Doctor Barry to serve in South Africa.  There she made medical history. She became the first British surgeon to perform a Caesarian section. Doctor Barry performed this operation on a woman unable to give birth naturally. She cut open the mother’s stomach and removed the baby. Both the mother and baby survived. The mother named the baby boy James Barry, to honour the skilled doctor.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Doctor Barry also worked hard to improve living conditions wherever she served. In South Africa she discovered the cause of Cape Town’s bad water. And she worked to get a better water system.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Doctor Barry also used her power to reform the medical system. She made new rules so that only trained people could give out medicines to patients. She also introduced changes for patients in hospitals – like receiving better food and fresh air. And Doctor Barry improved care for soldiers and their families.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Doctor Barry cared well for sick people and soldiers. However, she did not always have good relationships with her Army chiefs. She often got into trouble. When war broke out in Eastern Europe she made a request. She asked to serve in the Crimean War. But her chiefs said No.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "However, she went without their approval. There she met Florence Nightingale. Nightingale was a nurse. She achieved great honour for her work with injured soldiers. But James Barry and Florence Nightingale did not like each other. Barry often got angry quickly. And she often shouted at people. Florence Nightingale later wrote:",
                    "Voice 3",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "But Florence Nightingale and the Army officers never imagined Doctor Barry’s secret. Doctor Barry had a smooth face and high voice, but she acted like a man. She hid her female body under extra clothes. And she did a job that only men did. So no one suspected she was a woman.  She kept her secret for fifty years … until the day she died.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But even then some mystery remained. The woman who discovered James Barry’s secret did not tell people immediately. She waited until Doctor Barry’s body was buried. So no one could prove if she was telling the truth.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The British Army denied that James Barry was a man. They closed Doctor Barry’s Army records for one hundred years. They did not let anyone see them. Many people talked about Doctor Barry’s story, but there was no evidence. Was the woman telling the truth or had she made up the story? No one knew for sure … until 2009.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "At this time, a South African doctor began researching Doctor Barry. This doctor’s name was Michael du Preez. And he found evidence that Doctor Barry was a woman. Doctor du Preez found letters. Some were written by Margaret Bulkley. And others were written by James Barry. These letters were tested by hand writing experts. And the writing in all the letters was the same. The letters proved that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were the same person.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Most history books state that Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was the first female doctor in England.  And they state that she became a doctor in 1865. But Doctor du Preez’s research shows that Anderson was not Britain’s first female doctor. Instead, that honour goes to Margaret Bulkley – a poor, young woman from Ireland who secretly achieved that record, over 50 years earlier.",

No one knew what kind of sickness she had. Now, experts think she may have had scarlet fever or meningitis. Her sickness was very serious. Her family believed that Helen was going to die.",

                    "Helen did not die. She seemed to recover from her sickness. Her family was very happy. But all was not well. Helen’s mother saw that Helen’s behaviour had changed. Helen did not react to noise. She did not react to movement either. When Helen’s mother placed her hand in front of Helen’s eyes, Helen did not move. She could not see. She could not hear. The sickness had left Helen blind and deaf.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Life for Helen and her family was difficult. Helen became a troublesome child. She smashed things in the house. She was angry. She was intelligent but she had no way to communicate. By the time she was six years old, Helen’s family needed a new way to help her. They travelled to an institute for the blind. Doctors there said that Helen would never see or hear again. But the director of the institute told them not to lose hope. He said that Helen could learn. She only needed a teacher.",

                    "Then, a small event changed Helen forever. One day, Helen and Anne were walking outside. They passed a water well. Anne took Helen’s hands. On one hand she wrote the letters w – a – t – e – r. On the other hand, she poured cool water. Suddenly, Helen understood the meaning of the word water. She now understood the symbols of language.",

                    "After this, Helen wanted to know more and more. Anne continued to teach her words and their meanings. Soon Anne taught Helen to read and write. Helen did this through her sense of touch. People were very surprised that Helen could read, write and communicate! This was not common for blind people in the 1800s. But Helen did not ever give up.

When you visit, you will see of some of the world’s most wonderful, and stupid, inventions ever sold. But the Museum of Failure is not only there so you can laugh at failed products. It also shows how very successful companies often fail – even companies like Apple, Amazon, and Twitter. And you can see how these companies learned from their mistakes. Today’s Spotlight is on the Museum of Failure.",

He noticed that people do not like to talk about their failures. They cause us shame. But Dr. West believes that failures are important. Failure often leads to success. And, to make something new, it is often necessary to fail. Doctor West started the Museum of Failure so that people could talk about failure more openly. He spoke to the PBS News, about creating the Museum of Failure.",

But they do not act on them out of fear. The Rejuvinique mask shows that making something new is easier than you think.

                    "Sometimes, though, these failures can have terrible consequences. One of the most important failures at the Museum of Failure is thalidomide. Thalidomide is a drug invented in the early nineteen fifties. Today, doctors use it to treat cancer and leprosy. But thalidomide has a dark history. When it was first released, its creators said it was a wonder drug. It helped people sleep. It treated anxiety and worry. It even helped with morning sickness, an illness that sometimes happens during pregnancy. Thalidomide was very popular, and it was supposed to be safe. In some countries, you could even get it without a note from a doctor.",

                    "But the makers of thalidomide did not test it well. Or they ignored their tests. Thalidomide was safe for adults. But if a pregnant woman took it, the drug hurt the baby. Thalidomide causes serious birth defects in early pregnancy. It can damage a baby’s brain, its eyes, and its arms and legs. Many thalidomide babies were born with very short arms and legs. Many died. Doctors no longer give thalidomide during pregnancy. But over 24,000 children were hurt after the drug was released.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Thalidomide was one of the greatest disasters in medical history. But its failure did have some positive effects. Before thalidomide, companies did not have to report the results from all of their tests. There were fewer rules for what they had to test. After the thalidomide disaster, countries forced drug makers to test in more ways. Thalidomide hurt many, many people. But it also made the drugs we take today safer.",

                    "Some of the products at the Museum of Failure show that failure can even be the secret to success. Teflon is a chemical used in many different products. It makes surfaces very slippery. Nothing gets stuck to Teflon. So, people use it in non-stick cooking pans. It does not let electricity pass through it. A lot of electronic devices have Teflon in them. People also use it in electrical  wiring. And it can also make fabric resistant to stains and water.",

                    "But the creation of Teflon was an accident. Roy Plunkett was the chemist who created Teflon. He worked for the American company DuPont. He was trying to mix different chemicals. One night, he left some of these chemicals in a very cold environment. But, when he came to work the next morning, the chemical had changed. Instead of being a liquid, it had turned into a white powder. And Plunkett had no idea what it was.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Plunkett could have ignored the material. He could have thrown it away. But, instead, he decided to test the material. He spent six months trying to understand what it was. And interest in the chemical began to grow. Soon, Du Pont was making millions of kilograms of Teflon each year. Plunkett had made a mistake. But he was able to turn his mistake into great success.",

                    "The woman faced her former prison guard. He and the other guards had done terrible things to her and other women in the prison camp. The guards had beaten the women. They had denied the women food, and medicine. The women had done nothing wrong. They did not deserve this punishment.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But now, years later, the guard had come to her. He was asking her to forgive him. What would she say? How could she answer him? Today’s Spotlight is on this woman, Corrie ten Boom, and her answer.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "You may have heard another Spotlight program about Corrie’s father, Casper ten Boom. Casper and his family lived in the Netherlands during World War Two. During that time, the German army controlled that country and many others. They were fighting a war for control of Europe. The German government was also trying to rid these countries of particular groups of people – including the Jews, and Gypsies. They killed millions of people in planned executions, and in prison camps.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The ten Boom family disagreed with these policies. For four years, Casper and his family worked to help Jews and other people in danger. They hid people in their home. They also worked to find safe places for the people to stay – places outside the city where they lived. In this way, they helped to protect more than 80 people.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But finally, in February 1944, the authorities learned of the ten Boom family’s illegal acts. They arrested many members of the family, including Casper, Corrie and her older sister, Betsie.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Casper was very old. He died ten days later in prison. Corrie was 51 years old. Betsie was several years older. The two sisters were held in separate rooms at the prison. They stayed in this prison for several months. Then, in June, the authorities moved both sisters to a prison camp. Here, they were together again. But their situation was about to get extremely difficult.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In September, authorities moved many of the prisoners in the camp. Guards ordered them on to a train. This train was originally designed to carry cows. But now, people filled the cars. They had little food, or water. Finally, they arrived at a prison camp in Germany called Ravensbruck.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Ravensbruck was the largest prison camp for women in Germany. And it was a terrible place. The prisoners had very little food. Guards forced them to work hard. They beat prisoners for any reason. And they also killed many prisoners, by poisoning them with gas.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In the camp, Betsie’s health quickly began to fail. Corrie did everything she could do to protect her sister. She tried to give her extra food. She protected Betsie from the guards, and from difficult work.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Betsie also protected Corrie, but in a different way. Betsie followed their father’s example. The family was Christian. Every day, their father read the Christian Bible with his daughters. They also prayed to God together. It was this faith that caused them to protect people in danger. They were following the example of Jesus Christ. Even in the prison camp, the sisters continued to read their Bible and pray.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "However, Corrie was very angry. Instead, Betsie encouraged Corrie to be thankful – even for the little things, and the difficult things. She also encouraged Corrie to forgive. This was the most difficult thing for Corrie. But forgiveness is a central teaching of the Christian faith. Christians believe that God forgives people for the wrong things that they do. They also believe that they must follow God’s example. They must forgive people that do wrong things to them.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Betsie did forgive the guards. However, over the months, Betsie became more and more weak. Finally, in December, she died from sickness and lack of food. Soon after Betsie’s death, the authorities released Corrie. Corrie did not know why they released her at this time, but her prison sentence was complete. She returned home to the Netherlands, without Betsie. Corrie moved back into her father’s house alone.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Corrie felt lost without Betsie. How could she continue? But slowly, she remembered their talks in the prison camp. Betsie had wanted to share a message of forgiveness. And she wanted to open a home to help people damaged by the war.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "When the war ended in 1945, Corrie opened a home just like Betsie had wanted to. At first, the people who came were former prisoners. But soon, the home also began to serve Dutch people who worked with the German authorities. These people were now suffering very bad treatment from their communities. And they also suffered deep regret for the things they had done during the war. At first, Corrie found it hard to accept these people. But again, she followed Betsie’s example of forgiveness.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Corrie also began to travel and tell her family’s story. She wrote a book about these experiences. It is called “The Hiding Place”. In it, she tells the story from the beginning of this program.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In 1947, Corrie spoke at a church in Germany. After her speech, a man came to talk to her. He had been a guard at Ravensbruck. However, since then, he had become a Christian. And he deeply regretted the terrible things he had done as a guard. He asked Corrie for forgiveness. He held out his hand, for her to hold. Corrie wrote about her feelings and thoughts in that second:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "Forgiveness is not an emotion – I knew that. Forgiveness is an act of the will. The will can work, even if the heart is cold. “Jesus, help me!” I prayed quietly, “I can lift my hand. I can do that much. You supply the feeling.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "So Corrie put her hand into his hand. As she did, something amazing happened. She began to feel a healing emotion – it was forgiveness. It filled her heart. And she began to cry. Corrie wrote about what she said:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“I forgive you brother!” I cried, “With all my heart!” For a long time, we held each other’s hands, the former guard and the former prisoner. I had never known God’s love as deeply as I did then.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Corrie worked with victims of war for the rest of her life. She died in 1983, at the age of 91. Corrie was honored by many governments and Jewish organizations for the work she did. But it was Corrie’s example of forgiveness that brought healing to many people.",

                    "In 1999, an animal organisation talked to Lawrence Anthony. They told him about a herd of elephants. These elephants were a big problem. They were very dangerous. They charged, or ran at, vehicles and people. The elephants were so dangerous that the authorities would have to kill them. But Anthony did not want that to happen. He wanted to save the elephants. So he decided to give them a home at Thula Thula.",

                    "After being held for six years, Patrick escaped. In his letters, he writes that he had a strange dream. In the dream, he heard the voice of God telling him to leave. So Patrick left. He walked almost 322 kilometres toward the Irish coast. There, he was able to get on a ship to Britain and return to his family.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In Britain, Patrick studied to become a Christian priest. He lived with other religious men, as a monk. But then, Patrick’s writings say that he had another dream, this time from an angel. This angel told Patrick to go back to Ireland.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Historical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "He also added a circle to the common Christian cross. This became the Celtic cross or the cross of Ireland. The circle was the symbol of the sun. The sun was a powerful Irish symbol for many people. Patrick combined the circle and cross. This showed that Jesus was like the sun.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "St. Patrick is also closely connected to the green shamrock plant. It has three leaves. It is often used as a symbol of Ireland. Some stories suggest that St. Patrick used this plant to teach people the Christian idea of the Trinity – that God is three but also one.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But just how did the world start celebrating St. Patrick’s day on March 17th every year? That is because March 17th is the anniversary of St. Patrick’s death. He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day. Then they returned home to eat, drink and dance.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "As Irish people moved to other countries, the traditions went with them. The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was in New York City, in the United States, in the year 1762. Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In the 17-and 1800’s, large groups of Irish immigrants moved to the United States. This spread Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations to many communities there. But the United States and Ireland are not the only placed that celebrate this holiday. People in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Japan and Russia all celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. People have even celebrated this day on the International Space Station!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But the biggest celebrations today are in Ireland. It has been a public holiday there since 1903. Today, in the city of Dublin, about one million people take part in Saint Patrick’s Festival. This celebration is five days long! It includes parades, music, dancing, outdoor plays, fireworks and more!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In the past, Saint Patrick’s Day was mainly a religious celebration. Until the 1970’s, Irish law even said that the bars must be closed on March 17th. But now in most places, it is more a celebration of Ireland and Irish culture. But no matter why you celebrate, make sure to wear green on March 17th – or you may get pinched!",

                    "Like many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.",

                    "William Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“",

But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Blake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:",

Once they are skilled, they can make school clothes and other thins to sell in the market. Sister Angelique teaches other women to cook foods such as bread. They can sell this food in the market or by visiting houses in the community. Sister Angelique even helped a group of women start a garden. Together they panted seeds and cared for the plants. The women used the vegetables and foods from the garden to feed their families. And they sold what remained.",

                    "But they also needed something more.  They needed to avoid accidents like the loss of Admiral Shovell’s ships. To do this they needed to know exactly where they were. If you look at almost any map, it is divided into small squares by lines.  The lines that go from east to west are the latitude lines. And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars. But they could not measure their east-west position, or longitude, by that method. They needed a good way to measure the ship’s ‘longitude’.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "King Charles the Second of England knew how important it was to solve this problem.  If the problem was not solved, more ships could be lost. In 1675, King Charles ordered the building of the Royal Observatory. The Observatory was a place where people could study the stars. They could work on the problem of establishing longitude at sea. The King created the Observatory in Greenwich.",
                    "The first chief of the Observatory was John Flamsteed. Falmsteed worked hard, but he could not solve the longitude problem. And after the loss of Admirals Shovell’s ships, there was even more pressure to find a solution. So in 1714 the British Government offered a prize of GBP 20,0009. The prize would go to the first person who could find a method of measuring longitude at sea. Some people thought that this would never by possible.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Our story moves on, to one man – John Harrison. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1693. He was 21 years old when the government offered the prize. Like his father, he was a carpenter. He made things with wood. He did not have much education. But John was very good at making clocks. At that time, all clocks were made from wood. But John made many improvements to the clock design. His clocks did not break, like other clocks. And his clocks were very accurate. Each month they lost or gained no more than one second. They were more accurate than many of the best clocks in London. Three of these clocks still exist. And they are still very accurate!",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Harrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "It took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "However, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "So in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.",

These moving tables bring pieces of machinery to the men. They build the machines together. Soon the machines begin to take shape. They are cars.",

His cars have made him one of the most successful men in the United States. People all over the world know his name. But Henry Ford also has a secret. He is an anti-Semite, a person who hates the Jewish people. Henry Ford will always be known for his success. In some ways, he changed the world. But his views also hurt many people. These views will forever change how people see him for the worse. Today’s Spotlight is on the complicated legacy of Henry Ford.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Henry Ford was born in 1863 in the United States to a family of farmers. His parents were not wealthy. And, Ford did not complete much schooling. Instead, his family expected him to work on the farm.",

                    "But soon Ford saw that there was a problem. During that time, cars took a very long time to build. And, there was no single way of making them. Each car was different, and every part was special to each car. This made cars cost a lot of money.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Ford believed that he could make cars more quickly, without spending as much money. Instead of building cars one at a time, he would make car parts. Any part would work in any of his cars. And the parts would fit together easily. This would save his workers time and make the job easier.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Ford also invented the assembly line. The assembly line is a method of working. In an assembly line, workers stand along moving tables.

Even poorer people could buy one. So, Ford sold many more than other car companies. Soon, the Ford Motor company was the biggest car company in the United States. And everyone began to copy Ford’s methods. Even today, companies use methods like those invented by Henry Ford.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "But Ford also believed many false and dangerous things. In the 1910’s, he read a book called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. This false document claims to be a Jewish plan to secretly take over the world. It was created in Russia to justify Jewish persecution. But Ford did not know this writing was not true. He believed what he read. And he began to spread his beliefs to other people. For example, he went on a camping trip with several friends. During that time, he spoke a lot about his antisemitic beliefs. One of his friends wrote about it in his personal notes.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Henry Ford began to blame the Jewish people for everything in the world that he did not like. He even blamed them for jazz music and some popular clothing styles. He had no evidence. But he was sure he knew something no one else did. And soon, he began to tell the world. In 1918, he bought a newspaper company. It was called the Dearborn Independent. He used the newspaper to spread his antisemitic beliefs. He encouraged many of his workers to buy copies. The places that sold his cars gave them away. He published a book called The International Jew. And some people began to listen. Hasia Diner is a teacher of American Jewish history. She spoke to PBS about why this was so dangerous.",

If some local food server says something antisemitic, well, nobody cares. Somebody may listen. They may repeat it. But it will not spread far. But Henry Ford was able to gain a national audience with his words. This made him a very dangerous person.”",

And, he believed many of the same things as Ford. He is also to blame for the Holocaust. The Holocaust was the deaths of over six million Jewish people and five million others hated by the Nazis. In nineteen twenty-five, Hitler wrote a book. It was called Mein Kampf, or My Struggle. In the book, he called Ford’s work very important. The International Jew gave him and many other Nazis hate-filled ideas. Ford did not kill any Jews himself. But people used his work to make a case for murder.",

                    "Today, people still read The International Jew. The book is not based on facts. But people still believe it. The book says it is right to hate the Jews. When times are difficult, the book gives them someone to blame. Bill McGraw is a writer at Bridge Magazine. In 2019, he wrote about Ford’s antisemitism.",

It has been over 72 years since his death. But his hate is stronger than ever. It grows on websites where people who hate Jews talk to each other.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "By the end of his life, Henry Ford denied his antisemitic beliefs. He saw pictures of the Holocaust. And he could not continue to hate the Jews. He stopped publishing the Dearborn Independent. And his children used much of his money to fight hate. Yet, Ford is a difficult person to talk about. Today, the Ford Motor Company is one of the largest vehicle companies in the world. And Ford created modern manufacturing. Henry Ford helped create some the good things in the modern world. But he also helped create an evil that continues to this day. And it may not be possible to separate the two.",

                    "There is an ancient story told in Thailand. It happened in the 1700s. The story is set in the kingdom of Burma, which is now the country of Myanmar. At that time, Burma had defeated Thailand in a war. There were many Thai prisoners in Burma. The king of Burma decided to have a celebration. One event was a boxing competition. The king and other people watched. Burmese fighters fought against the Thai prisoners. There was one Thai fighter who beat everyone else. He even beat the best boxing teacher in Burma. His name was Nai Khanomtom. The King of Burma had a high opinion of Nai Khanomtom. He gave Khanomtom a very good prize. The king released him from prison. Khanomtom was free to move back to Thailand.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today, a similar thing is happening in Thailand. Siriporn Thaveesuk went to prison when she was only 17. Soon, she joined a boxing program. Three years later Thaveesuk won an international competition. And, like Nai Khanomtom, she won her freedom from prison.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Thaveesuk is one of many prisoners in Thailand who are training to be boxers. If they win, they will be closer to freedom. Today’s Spotlight is on Thai prisoners who improve their lives and gain their freedom through boxing.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Thai boxing is also called Muay Thai. Two Muay Thai fighters stand together in a square shaped fighting area. They wear short trousers but no shirts. Each of their hands and wrists are tightly wrapped with white rope. When the fight begins the fighters use their hands, elbows, knees and feet to hit each other. People cheer for the fighters. Muay Thai is a popular form of entertainment in Thailand.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Prisons in Thailand are using this form of entertainment for a new purpose. The Thai government began a program for boxing in prisons. Prisoners all around the country compete in Muay Thai fights. This provides entertainment but it also gives the prisoners something to do.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Muay Thai is a very difficult sport. Fighters must be very strong. They must live a very healthy life. They spend many hours training their bodies. They also train their minds. They spend hours meditating and breathing. This training is helpful for prisoners. It is healthier than other activities such as smoking cigarettes or taking illegal drugs. Aree Chaloisuk is the director of Klong Pai prison. He tells Hemispheres magazine about the advantages of the program for the prisoners:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Muay Thai is a strong part of Thai culture. I think the fighters are proud to take part in the program. From what I have seen, it can improve bad behaviour. It provides a chance for a job for prisoners after they leave prison. They can compete instead of becoming criminals again.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Prisoners also train and fight for another reason. If they win their fights, they can reduce the time they have to stay in prison. Like in the story of Nai Khanomtom, prisoners can win their freedom through Muay Thai. One man working to do this is Chalernpol Sawangsuk. He is 26 years old. He is in prison for selling illegal drugs. But since he started practicing Muay Thai in prison, his life is different. Sawangsuk told Hemispheres magazine:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“It was a big change to my life. I think the program has helped me to concentrate. I have slowed down. I think about things more. I am more reasonable. I have seen myself grow up. The other life, I think it is really behind me.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sawangsuk has won five fights. Through these, he has reduced his prison time by seven years. There are other prisoners who have been completely set free from prison. One of these is Amnat Ruenroeng. He is now on Thailand’s Olympic boxing team. Winning a place on the national boxing team is a dream for all of the fighters. It is a great chance to bring honor to their country.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "An organization called Prison Fight works with the Muay Thai prison program. Their aim was to help prisoners reduce prison time. Today, they help by providing equipment to the Thai prisoners. Prison Fight also organizes local and international events with the Thai government. They believe it is also a good way to share Thai culture. So prisoners in Thailand sometimes fight people from other countries. One international Prison Fight event took place in January 2013. Thai prisoners fought against fighters from France, Myanmar, and other countries. The event was a great success. Saichon Somnet is the head coach at Klong Prem prison. He talks in a video about the event:",

                    "“Today makes me happy and gives me a chance to share Muay Thai with people outside our country. It is very difficult for prisoners to get this kind of chance. I am very happy it is happening today.”",

They hope that Muay Thai keeps people from doing illegal activities. It also gives prisoners new skills and chances for the future. Wanchai Roujanavong is the director general of Thailand’s Department of Corrections. He told TIME magazine:",

                    "“People in prison have a lot of time. It is a good environment for dedicating yourself to boxing. The sport also provides new chances after prison. A lot of people have a difficult time finding jobs after they are released. But in boxing, no one cares about your history.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Some prisoners have even found that fighting gives them new hope. It even helps them fix past mistakes. A boxer named Black Lion has fought in many Muay Thai fights in prison. He tells TIME magazine that he hopes to improve himself and his relationships. Black Lion voices the hope of many prisoners:",

They are not real rocks, but colourful plastic shaped to look like rocks. The plastic rocks are placed at different spaces and positions to create a route, or path, up the wall. So each person has the same choices about where to put their feet and hands. Two climbers place their hands on the wall. They tense their bodies. They wait.",

                    "When they get the signal to go, they race up the wall as fast as they can. They move so quickly they look as if they are running up the wall. When they reach the top, they hit a button with their hand. This marks their time. There is a rope that catches them and brings them slowly back to the ground. This is the sport of speed climbing. These races are only six or seven seconds long. This makes speed climbing the fastest sport in the world. Today’s Spotlight is on speed climbing – a new Olympic sport for 2020.",

                    "Sports are added through a complex process. Olympics officials consider global popularity, cultural diversity, and if there are organizations that can help set the rules. But two other important goals are to reach younger people and to create an equal opportunity for men and women to perform in the games. With these new sports, especially surfing and climbing, officials hope to achieve these goals.",

                    "Officials chose climbing because it has become more and more popular around the world. When you hear the word climbing, you may think of climbing a mountain. People have been climbing mountains for thousands of years. They climb to travel and explore and to have fun. But speed climbing is a little different.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Speed climbing does not happen on a mountain. It happens on a wall made by people. It usually happens inside a building. And this sport is becoming more and more popular. The International Federation of Sport Climbing, or IFSC, says that more than 140 countries have speed climbing walls. And 35 million climbers do this sport worldwide.",

                    "The IFSC makes exact rules for this new sport. They also designed the route. Every speed climbing route is the same all over the world, so everyone climbs the same path. Each route is either ten meters or 15 meters high. Brendan Blanchard is a climber who wrote about speed climbing for Climbing Magazine. He explained the sport like this,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“The rules for the official IFSC speed climbing are simple. Climbers compete on the same path, side by side. The first to the top wins. Times are recorded by a device under the climber’s foot at the base of the path, and a sensor at the top. The path is always the same. Everyone can train on the same path at any climbing gym that has a speed wall.”",

                    "Speed climbing is not for everyone. Many people like to be on a real mountain. Other people do not want the risks of climbing so fast. But many people see it as a new challenge. They compare it to running up a wall! Top speed climbers come from places all over the world, like Spain, Italy, and China. Reza Alipour holds the world record for the 15 metre wall climb. He comes from the country of Iran. He climbed the 15 meter wall in only 5.48 seconds. He is so fast that people sometimes call him Persian Cheetah — the fastest animal in the world.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "But not everyone thinks that speed climbing is a good thing. For many people who climb, climbing is more like a way of life than a sport. It is about more than speed or competition. It is about being on a rock or a mountain and giving yourself a challenge. Alex Honnold is one of the greatest free climbers in the world. Free climbers climb mountains without using ropes or other protection. Honnold’s climbs often take him hundreds of metres up a mountain with nothing to stop him from falling but his own hands.

Or you can make them touch the ground with any part of their body that is not their feet. It sounds simple. But Sumo is rich in tradition, customs, and complex rules.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The Sumo wrestler is a powerful athlete. However, he does not look like most athletes. In most fighting sports, the fighters are divided by weight. Small people only fight other small people. But Sumo are not divided by weight, so being large helps. Sumo wrestlers weigh around 90 kilograms when they begin to train. Top Sumo weigh between 130 and 180 kilograms. The largest Sumo ever weighed 272 kilograms.",

                    "Sumo compete wearing only a mawashi. This traditional clothing is one long piece of cloth. It goes around the fighter’s waist and between his legs. A fighter’s hair is long. If any hair touches the ground, the fighter will lose the fight. So fighters tie their hair high on their heads. There is a different way to tie the hair for each Sumo skill level.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are many skill levels in Sumo. This list of skill levels, called the Banzuke, is very important. If a Sumo wins, he moves up the list. If a Sumo loses, he will move down the list. Moving up the Banzuke brings honour. But it also means more money, freedom, and moving closer to becoming a yokozuna",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "A yokozuna is a great champion. A Sumo must win many fights to become a yokozuna. But he must also demonstrate grace and honour as he fights. His behaviour out of the competitions must also bring honour. Once he has become a yokozuna, he will be a yokozuna for life. If he does badly at a competition, he is expected to retire.

                    "The Banzuke rankings also have meaning beyond the wrestling circle. Sumo train in a “stable”. Each stable has a trainer and group of Sumo that exercise together. Sumo compete by themselves. But these stables are similar to teams. Each stable has high and low ranked Sumo.",

They must do what they are told to do. Sumo the lower rankings are not given any money or permitted to go out at night. These are all reasons for them to work hard and win more fights.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sumo began 1500 years ago. The first Sumo fights were connected closely to the Shinto religion. They were part of a celebration that included dancing, theatre, and prayers for a good harvest. As time went on, Sumo became a way to train men for war. It was a measure of strength and power. But in 1603, Japan’s areas were united. This brought in a time of wealth and peace. Official Sumo organizations began. They established rules and traditions. Sumo was recognized as the national sport of Japan.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Today, many people see Sumo as only a sport. However, there are still symbols of the Shinto religion found in Sumo. For example, before a Sumo enters the circle to compete, he must throw salt before him. This is believed to purify the circle. Then the Sumo must lift one foot high in the air and then bring in down against the ground. This is believed to keep evil spirits away. Sumo fighters are not required to be Shinto. But the influence of Shinto still surrounds Sumo.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sumo is still popular in Japan today. But some people criticize the sport. This is for several reasons. First, only a limited number of foreigners may compete. Also, no women are permitted to be Sumo. Another problem is the long term health effects of the Sumo life. When a Sumo retires, he becomes much less active. This can lead to problems such as knee and back pain, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. Most Japanese men live until they are eighty years old. But most Sumo live less than sixty years.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another serious criticism of Sumo is corruption. That is, the winner of a fight is chosen before the fight begins. Because the rankings are so important, some Sumo are willing to exchange money for losing a fight. This may permit a lower ranked Sumo to move up the banzuke.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "And finally, people are concerned about hazing. Hazing is when lower ranked Sumo are treated badly by higher ranked Sumo. In 2008, the leader of a stable and three Sumo were arrested over the death of a young Sumo. The leader of the stable had told the men to beat the boy. Even the leader had broken a bottle on the boy’s head. This was an extreme case. But in the world of Sumo, training methods are often kept secret.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "To people outside of Japan, Sumo may seem like a simple competition between two fighters. But it is a complex sport, full of tradition, language, and ceremony. It also has its problems. But it is an important part of the cultural history and social identity of Japan.",

He had played for the famous football team Manchester United. He had a new job on another good football team – Lazio. But, in 2001 he took a test. The test found that he had used the drug steroids.",

                    "Steroids are a strong version of testosterone. Human bodies create testosterone naturally. Women have low levels of testosterone. Men usually have higher levels of testosterone. This is why men usually have more muscle – the hard tissue on the body that gives people strength.",

They can be taken in by mouth, rubbed on the skin or injected. They have been used to treat people with cancer, HIV and AIDS and other diseases. But people who are not sick also use steroids.",

                    "Athletes began using steroids in the 1950s. Steroids gave athletes an advantage. They could be stronger and faster than their competitors. By the 1960s many major sports organizations had passed laws against using steroids. The organizations began to test athletes to make sure that they were not using steroids.",

Another child runs up to the first child, places her hands on the back of the first child, and leaps or jumps over the first child. Any number of children can play the game. They all take turns to leap, or jump, like a frog. In other countries children jump like a different animal. In France children call this same game ‘sauté-mouton’ which means ‘leap sheep’.

                    "This beautiful music is made with a sitar. This is a traditional musical instrument from India. It looks a bit like another popular instrument called a guitar. On one end of the sitar is a round empty gourd. This deep rounded base makes the sound louder and more complex. From this base comes a long flat stick called the “neck.” Almost 30 strings, like thin ropes, go up and down the neck. The sitar player plays seven of these strings. He pulls on them with his fingers. The remaining strings make noise as the musician plays the other strings above them.",

                    "This instrument is very complex and beautiful. It is one of the major instruments in the traditional music of India. But people all around the world know and love sitar music. How did this instrument become popular in countries far from India? There is one musician who helped encourage people’s love of sitar music more than anyone else. Some people call him the father, or founder, of world music. Today’s Spotlight is on the famous Indian musician Ravi Shankar.",

                    "Ravi Shankar was born in India in 1920. When he was 10 years old he moved to Europe. His brother led a dance group that performed traditional Indian music and dancing. Shankar learned to dance and joined his brother’s group. Shankar also learned about many cultures and customs. He learned many kinds of music. But he loved music from India the best.

                    "When he turned 18 Ravi Shankar moved back to India. He went to live with a famous musician named Allauddin Khan. Khan became Shankar’s teacher and spiritual guide. Shankar spent six years living and studying with Khan. He learned classical Indian music styles and instruments. But the instrument Shankar loved most was the sitar.",

                    "Shankar soon became a well-known musician and composer in India. He wrote music for the National Theatre. He worked as the director for All India Radio for many years.

Western musicians became interested in learning to play Indian traditional music. They even played western and eastern music together. They made music that mixed the traditions from different countries and cultures. This style of music is sometimes called world music.",

                    "Ravi Shankar became friends with many famous people. One of the most famous was the British musician George Harrison. Harrison was a member of the rock band The Beatles. He first met Shankar in London. Then Harrison visited Shankar in India. Shankar taught Harrison to play the sitar. Soon, millions of people heard sitar music in songs by The Beatles. Ravi Shankar told Shashi Vyas in an interview:",

                    "“I was one of the first when I first started to experiment with western instruments and western musicians. George Harrison came to me because he was so interested in our music.

Shankar, Harrison and others gathered 250,000 US dollars for the people of Bangladesh.",

                    "“I have experimented with non-Indian instruments, even electronic ones. But all my experiences were based on traditional Indian songs. When people discuss tradition, they do not know what they are talking about. Over centuries, classical music has had elements added to it. It has had changes and improvements. But it has always held to its traditional base. Today, the difference is that the changes are faster.”",

                    "Ravi Shankar often played with musicians who used other styles of music. But he always kept the important parts of Indian folk music. For example, he was always free to change the music while playing. Even when playing with many other musicians Shankar would not always follow the music exactly as it was written. He would play what he felt sounded good. He did not always follow the set rules that some western music uses. Shankar told Sashi Vyas:",

He was also a teacher and example for many people.  His two daughters, Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar, are also both successful musicians.

                    "Have you heard music like this before? It is called a steel pan. There are hundreds of different groups playing steel pan music. It is played for presidents and for kings. It is played in famous music centres. But steel pan music is connected most closely to one place: the island countries of Trinidad and Tobago. Today’s Spotlight is on steel pan music.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The history of Trinidad and Tobago is full of struggle. Over the years, many countries have occupied Trinidad and Tobago. At different times, Spain, The Netherlands, France, and Britain have each controlled these islands. People also came to the islands to escape from trouble or trial in their home country.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "While many people came because they wanted to, many did not. The French brought African people to the island as slaves. Soon there were more enslaved people than free people. Around the year 1800 there were about 17,000 people on the islands. Ten thousand of these people were enslaved. Several years later, Britain took control of the islands and banned the slave trade.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The French did not only bring slaves to the islands. They also brought the tradition of Carnival. Carnival is also called Mardi Gras. It is a celebration before the Christian season of Lent. As they did in Paris, French people marched through the streets singing, dancing, and playing music. The former slaves joined the parade too. They brought their own drums and began adding their own beats to the celebration.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "People usually make drums by stretching animal skin over an open container. On the islands, people used these drums to communicate across great distances. Although the British ruler had banned the slave trade, the British would not give up control of the islands. And they were afraid the people would use the drums to send secret messages of revolt. So, in 1883, Carnival was celebrated but the government banned the drums.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many people did not want to give up their drums. The enslaved people had lost many things – their families, their own languages, and their religion. Music was one connection to the past. And drumming gave them a way to express their emotions without words. Also, they missed out on taking part in celebrating Carnival.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "So people found a way to keep drumming. Every time the government banned one kind of drum, the people found a new one. For example, people started to use bamboo. This plant grows in a large tube shape. The people would cut different sizes of bamboo and strike them together or hit them on the ground. This was called Tamboo Bamboo.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The Tamboo-Bamboo groups soon became large. They even began to fight over who was the best. Some even made their instruments into sharp pointed weapons. Also, many people were harvesting bamboo illegally. So in 1934 the British government banned Tamboo-Bamboo instruments.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This did not stop people from inventing more new drums. In 1936, a music group brought new steel drums to Carnival. This was the beginning of steel pan.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "People made these first steel pans from bread containers, paint containers, or waste containers. They were so popular that soon the young people of Trinidad were stealing every waste container they could find. Young people even took locked waste containers!",

                    "Sterling Betancourt grew up in Trinidad and Tobago. He told the BBC how people invented the steel pan. It was never a plan. He says:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“It was a very slow process. Everyone got together and invented the steel pan by using pots and pans and testing them out. The sound and the notes came. But we did not think about it — we just did it.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "They made steel pans by shaping the bottom of the containers with heavy tools. They shaped different thicknesses on different parts. This created many notes on a single pan. The steel pan was now able to play whole songs! It was still a drum, but a new kind of drum.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "During World War Two the music of steel pan became popular with American soldiers. They were living at a navy base in Trinidad. The navy base also brought a new resource for making steel pan instruments: oil containers!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The navy ships needed oil. The oil came in large 208-liter containers. When the containers were empty, they were perfect for making steel pans. The oil containers were thick metal and lasted much longer than other materials.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "After World War Two began the most popular time for steel pan music. Music groups set up steel pan music celebrations. Different steel pan groups would gather and compete against each other. As Trinidad and Tobago became more independent, steel pan became a more respected kind of music.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In 1962, Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation. Steel pan music was played at the national celebration. This was an important event for steel pan as well as for Trinidad and Tobago. This music was once banned street music. But now it had risen into a respected music form. It was part of Trinidad and Tobago’s national character.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Today, steel pan music has travelled around the world. Now people outside Trinidad and Tobago play it too. There are more than 800 steel pan groups in the world. Three hundred are in Britain. There are 240 in the United States. In Switzerland, there are 130 groups and 70 percent of Swiss pan players are women.",

                    "Even while it is popular around the world, steel pan music is still closely linked with the culture of Trinidad and Tobago.

                    "Breaking began in the United States in the 1970s. A man called Kool Herc liked to have parties at his home in New York City. He played music and people danced. He was very skilled at mixing the songs together and playing the best parts of each song.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Each song had a part where the words stopped, but the music continued. The music had only quick drumming and rhythm. This was called the “break” of the song. Kool Herc played these parts over and over. People danced longer when he played more breaks. They called the dance ‘breaking.’ And Kool Herc called the dancers at his parties ‘bboys’ and ‘bgirls.’",

                    "Over time, bboys and bgirls created different kinds of basic steps to breaking. The first is called ‘Toprock’. This is when the dancer jumps around on his feet when he first begins dancing. He listens to the rhythm of the music and first starts moving.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The second kind of step in breaking is called ‘Downrock’. This part of breaking uses the hands and feet on the floor. A dancer moves around on the floor in creative ways. Her hands and feet equally support her movements. She rolls and turns. She moves her arms and legs around into shapes.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The most difficult part of breaking is ‘power.’ This move requires a lot of skill and strength. A dancer’s head and shoulders are near the ground. But his legs are in the air. In this position, he turns in a fast circle. This kind of move often makes the crowd very happy.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The last kind of move is a ‘freeze.’ This is when the dancer suddenly stops moving in a surprising position. She stays very still when the music changes or stops. A dancer may also end her dance with a move called a “suicide”. In this move, a dancer acts as if she is going to fall. It looks painful and dangerous. But she controls her fall so she is not hurt.",

                    "Battles like this are one way that breaking builds communities. Sometimes people who do not agree can meet together for a battle.

                    "Often, people combine breaking with other kinds of performance. People in Japan and South Korea combine breaking with martial arts. These fighting sports include karate, kung fu, and taekwondo. Breakers add kicks and punches to the dance. They move in short, quick motions. Their clothes also show an influence from martial arts. These dancers may wear traditional breaking clothes and martial arts clothes together. They may wear white pants. Or they may wear a colored piece of cloth around their heads.",

The bombs also destroyed many works of art, literature, and music. A short time after the war, a musician named Remo Giazotto was in Dresden. He was looking through the remains of old buildings.

He used these to complete the piece of music he found. Most experts think that Giazotto wrote the music himself. But people still call the music “Albinoni’s Adagio.”",

He played it at the International Cello Festival in England. When Yo Yo Ma finished playing, he remained bowed over his instrument. The whole room was very quiet. Then, Yo Yo Ma stood up and raised his hand. To everyone’s surprise, Vedran Smailović walked forward! He had been watching the performance. Musician Paul Sullivan was there.

In those times, the state of Mississippi had a severe problem with racism. The government allowed people to make life difficult for African Americans, and people with darker skin colour.

But reading the book helps the young girl understand Cassie Logan’s fear, and her other emotions. The girl reading is white. She lives in a very small town, where there are no black people. But the book helps her see what it is like to be different. When she finishes the book, she is crying. That night, she tells herself she will never judge another person by what they look like.

Cognitive empathy happens when a person tries to identify and understand another person’s emotions. Some people even imagine that they are the other person. There is even an old English idiom for cognitive empathy: taking a walk in another person’s shoes. It means to imagine that you have lived their life.",

                    "Scientists do not yet know exactly what happens in a person’s brain when they feel empathy. It is a very complex process. But scientists have observed it happening. They believe empathy involves a brain cell called a mirror neuron. These cells work when we observe other people. Mirror neurons send messages through the brain. This is called “firing”. When these cells fire, they help us to identify emotions we see. But the same kind of cell also fires when we HAVE that emotion. So, when we are sad, a mirror cell will fire. But when we see someone who is sad, that same cell fires. We can understand an emotion. And through mirror neurons, we feel that emotion ourselves.",

                    "Empathy is very important in society. Without empathy we would not help each other. We would not care for each other. As a feeling, empathy makes us want to help. It makes us want the world to be a better place.",

When you have empathy, it does not matter if they are close friends or far-away strangers. It is difficult not to act. It is hard not to help.”",

                    "Most people have empathetic feelings. But people can train themselves to be more empathetic. However, this takes work. Meeting people who are different than we are is one way to gain empathy. But distance often divides people. So it is difficult for people to understand each other when they never meet.",

In 2012, he helped show that reading increases empathy. In a test, he made people read different kinds of books. Some of these books were literary fiction, or complex invented stories. These stories made people think about the emotions of the characters in them. After reading these literary fiction books, the people were better able to understand what other people were thinking. And they could more easily identify emotions.",

                    "Many studies say that the effect of reading on empathy only works for complex fictional, or invented, stories.

                    "A chart is any piece of paper with a series of squares. The squares are where parents will place the stickers. Stickers are pieces of paper that will attach, or stick, to other things. They come in many shapes and sizes. They can be shaped like animals, faces, stars, or something else the child enjoys. When a child does something good, the parent attaches a sticker to the square on the chart. And if a family cannot use stickers, they can write a special mark or picture in the chart. When the child has filled all the squares with stickers or marks, she receives a prize.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "First, the goal should be stated positively. It is better to say, “John will keep his hands to himself.” than, “John will not hit other children.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Second, think about how long the child must behave. It is difficult for a child to behave all day. If she makes a mistake in the morning, she will have no reason to behave for the rest of the day.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Finally, only concentrate on one or two behaviours at one time. Children are still learning how to control themselves. Too many goals can be too much to remember.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "You must also consider the age and ability of each child. If a sticker chart is too complex, the child will not be able to understand it.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "You may also let the child create the sticker chart, and choose the goals and prizes. This will help the child feel involved. It will increase the chance that the sticker chart will work to change behaviour.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Sticker charts have several advantages for parents. They do not require parents to shout at, hit, or shame the child. Those methods teach children to solve problems with violence. When parents have a bad day, they may be less able to deal with children than on a good day. But sticker charts help stop parents from letting how they feel influence how they treat their children.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "And children like sticker charts too! Children need structure they can depend on. This makes them feel safe. Feeling safe is an important part of learning and growing. Sticker charts show children what parents expect of them. They also show progress. Children can see what they have done. They can follow along as they work toward a goal.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Sticker charts do not always work. Some children are too young. A good age to begin is around three years old. As children grow, both their goals and prizes need to grow too. A sticker chart will not work if the goals are too simple or the prizes too small.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sticker charts also do not work unless parents also follow the rules. When a child does not earn a sticker, some parents will feel bad. They will still give her a sticker. This teaches her that her parents will give her what she wants even if she does not behave.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "And finally, some children just do not seem to care about sticker charts. This can be difficult for parents – especially when one child reacts well to sticker charts and another child does not.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But sticker charts are not a perfect tool, even if people use them correctly. Erica Reischer is a family Psychologist. She helps families to work through problems together. She argues that tools like sticker charts can be harmful to children. She says that children begin to expect awards for ALL good behaviour. They affect a child’s own personal desire to do good things. A child may be less likely to help or behave if they do not get a sticker for doing it.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "So how can parents know if using a sticker chart is good or bad for their children? Sticker charts can be a way for children to learn right behaviour. It is easy to try this method and think about how it is affecting your family. And it is important to remember that the relationship between parent and child is always more important than a tool like a sticker chart.",

And they wanted these students to be successful in English-speaking universities. So, they needed to test international students’ English language skills before admitting them.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "There are different tests to determine a person’s English language skills. Each university decides which test it will give. However, most choose the TOEFL. Another test universities may choose is the International English Language Testing System or IELTS. To get a job or enter a school, most English-speaking universities require international students to pass these tests. That way, they can learn well in classes that are taught in English.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Most people who take the TOEFL are students. But some people take the TOEFL or the IELTS for other reasons. Some workplaces require a language test. It can be helpful for moving to an English-speaking country. And many professional programs require a test too. For example, a doctor who is moving from India to the US may have to take the TOEFL. This may be needed for approval to do her job in a new country.",

People in over a hundred different countries take it. But every person takes the same test. Experts then mark the test and give the person a score. The experts do not know whose test they are marking. This kind of test is more fair.",

                    "People taking the TOEFL must go to an official testing site to take the exam. They must pay to take the exam. They usually sit in a room at a small table or at a computer. The room may be very full of other people also taking the test. For many years, students took the TOEFL on paper. Sometimes people still take the TOEFL this way. But since 2005, most people take the test on computers.",

                    "The TOEFL looks at four different skills in English: reading, listening, speaking and writing. Students read or listen. Then they answer questions about what they have read or heard. They must also record themselves speaking English. And they must write some longer essays in English. It usually takes about four hours to take the TOEFL. But people prepare for much longer than that.",

Some of the ideas he was supposed to learn felt too complicated. And he was suddenly in a new environment. He had new friends and new activities to explore. He found it difficult to know when he should study. How much should he study? And what were the best ways to study?",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Does this sound familiar to you? Learning can be difficult, in or out of school. Sometimes, we forget too quickly. Or the material can seem too difficult. But there are many different reasons why we do or do not learn a subject. And there are ways of studying that are more effective than others. In today’s Spotlight we will look at some of these methods. Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good student.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The first step to being a good student is having confidence in yourself. Often, students who are having a difficult time believe it is because they are not intelligent.  But this is not true! Learning is how you become intelligent. All of us begin, as children, with no knowledge. From there, we learn and grow. Being a student means continuing this process. It means knowing you may not seem intelligent now, but you will be. Believing that you can learn is the most important step in being a good student. Geoff Nixon is a writer at Gemm Learning. He writes about the importance of confidence.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Confidence is important in learning at any age. When we feel confident, we are more likely to try new things. That will help us improve our abilities. It will help us build on things we already know. Confidence drives resiliency. This is the ability to recover when something has gone wrong and try again.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The second step of being a good student is understanding what kind of learning you prefer. Take language learning as an example. Some people learn language best by listening. They might learn well by listening to podcasts, audiobooks, or even Spotlight English! But other people learn best by doing. It helps them to apply the knowledge. They might need to speak to others to learn best. Some people are social learners, and study best with others. Others must be alone to learn. Understanding what style of learning you like can help you enjoy studying more. And, when you enjoy studying, you will be better at it.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Being a good student also means taking care of yourself. Our brains work better when our bodies are healthy. This means eating well, drinking lots of water, and taking time for breaks. The Feinberg School of Medicine is a university in the United States. Its students take very difficult tests to become doctors. They study for months and take an eight-hour examination. One successful student spoke to school staff after her test. She shared her secret of success: staying healthy!",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Another way to learn more effectively is to make a routine. Have special times each week when you study. And study even if you do not feel like it. Studying is not always entertaining. You may not always want to do it. But having a routine will force you to focus.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Routines are also important in reducing stress. And stress can make learning more difficult. If you are stressed, you are not thinking about what you are studying. You are thinking about your stress. Kali Patrick is a psychologist. She wrote on entrepreneur.com about the importance of routine. She said that “when you do not have a plan, life is uncertain. When you have no idea what is going to happen, you can feel worried, anxious, and out of control. Your fear response can turn on. Routines reduce stress naturally. They give some control back to you”.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Good students also study over many days. They do not try to study everything all at once. Instead, it is better to repeat the same information several times over a longer period.  Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist. He also studied memory. In 1885, he discovered that people forget at a fixed rate. If we learn a fact once, we lose that information quickly. But, if we learn it again after a short period, it will stay in our memories. The more we repeat it, the more we remember.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Finally, good students ask questions. This may seem frightening at first. Asking a question may show that you do not know about a subject. And that can cause shame and embarrassment. But if you do not ask, no one will be able to help. Questions are how we naturally seek answers. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. She studies the science of learning. She wrote that “Asking questions is what our brains were born to do. At least, this is the case when we were children. For young children, quite literally, seeking answers is just as important as seeking food or water.”",

Interesting facts are easy to memorize. But information that can be used directly in someone’s life is even better. Imagine a history class. It is very difficult to learn the names of famous people who lived long ago. Event dates are difficult to remember. But if you were learning the history of another country where you were going to move, things might be different. It might be very important that you know the information.",

If they have no experience with machines, it could be very difficult. But if they had worked on engines before, it would be easier. This is true of all subjects, whether it is language, art, or mathematics. We remember things that are useful to us. And if we do not have context, our minds will not recognize information. This is true even if you believe what you are learning is important. It might be very important to repair your car engine. But if you do not know the parts of an engine and what they do, you will not be able to learn. A good teacher will help connect new information to something you already understand. Or they will give you a wider base of knowledge to understand.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another important part of teaching is learning to understand and care about your students. This means learning who they are. Not all students are the same. And some are going through things you do not know about. Suzanne Tingley is a teacher. She wrote on the blog Hey! Teach:",

                    "Many people do not like to criticize. Criticizing may seem rude. Criticism can lead to shame and bad feelings when it is not planned out.

                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Constructive criticism is something that should always be shared in private. Begin by telling the student the good things you see about him or her. This will get you started in a good way. Then, tell them what you think is delaying their progress. Then, tell them how they can make a positive change. After, remind them that you believe in them as an individual. If you share your concerns in the right way, it is possible that the student will do what you suggested.”",

                    "Finally, it is important to let your students be creative. They should not be afraid to ask their own questions. Much teaching in the past treated children as listeners only. Teachers gave students knowledge, and students accepted it. If a student could not learn, teachers decided the student was not intelligent enough. But today, we know that learning works differently. Students learn best when they believe they have the power to ask and explore. Sometimes, it is even good when they get things wrong!",

You think about the problem for several minutes. When you finish, your answer might be incorrect. And your teacher will finally tell you the answer. But while you are working on the problem your attitude changes. The question becomes a puzzle. Now, you want to know the answer to this puzzle. You care about the answer. And you have learned to think on your own.",

They know that that learning is not about remembering everything you hear. But more than anything, they know they are not just teaching their subjects. They teach their students how to learn. And they teach them how to think for themselves. People who know how to think and learn will continue to grow. They can change more quickly when required to. And they will live fuller lives.",

                    "Pierre Gassendi was a famous scientist and philosopher in the early 1600s.  He was the one who named the Aurora Borealis. This name comes from Ancient Roman stories. Aurora was the name that Romans gave to the goddess of the dawn – the rising of the sun. The second half, Borealis, is named after the north wind. So in English Aurora Borealis means “the dawn of the north.”",

                    "If you live in the Northern part of the world you may have seen the northern lights before. They also appear in the far south. There they are called the Aurora australis. The Northern Lights appear in many colors. People most often see green or red. The color is different depending on how far north or south you are. The Northern Lights also look different at different altitudes – they look different high up in the mountains than at sea level.",

                    "During the Viking period, people thought that the Northern Lights were images of young women who were dead. Other people believed that the northern lights were signs of huge fires in the north. And other people thought that it was God lighting up the cold, dark parts of the world.",

                    "Inuit people believe that the lights are the land of the dead. They believe that dead friends in this land try to connect with living people. They think that this is what is happening when the lights change very fast.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The lights often change shape and color. The Scots call them “merry dancers” because of this movement. Some Native Americans believe that they can connect with spirits of the dead by whistling at the lights.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Danish people have a traditional story about the Northern Lights. They say that a group of large white birds called swans once flew too far north. The swans got caught in the ice. They moved their wings up and down, flapping to get free. Every time they flapped their wings, they made images in the sky. These images became the northern lights.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But not every country had a nice story about the Northern Lights like the Danish. Some cultures believed that the Northern Lights represented evil. They were afraid of the lights. They thought the lights were a terrible force. And many people believed that the Northern Lights caused natural disasters, like earthquakes or floods.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "These traditional stories are very interesting. But there is a scientific cause of the northern lights – the Sun!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sometimes there are storms on the sun. These storms release a cloud of solar particles into space. The solar particles are made up of atoms that have a magnetic charge. They are full of electric forces.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Some of these magnetic solar particles come near to the earth. When they do, they are pulled in by the earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls the particles to the two magnetic poles on the earth: the North Pole and the South Pole.",

In certain years, the sun has more storms. During these times, the northern lights can be seen from farther away. They may also be larger than usual. Rachel VanderVeen lives in Northern Canada. She says that the year 2012 had many solar storms. She tells Spotlight what happened:",

Even with the light from the town, they were amazing. Usually, we see the Northern Lights in bright green. But that day the colours made my husband run to find me. The lights were pink, purple and orange. We have lived in the north for many years now. That was the first time we have seen so many bright colours.”",

But it is difficult to capture such an amazing sight.  Some people spend days taking pictures of the lights.  Other people try to describe the northern lights in words. Today’s program ends with a part of a poem about the Northern Lights. It is called ‘The Aurora Borealis’ by S. Moore:",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Experts say that heat causes the most damage when outside temperatures stay high day to night. The middle of the day is usually the hottest. And then at night the temperature is cooler. A healthy person’s body can adapt, or change, during the day so that hot weather is not as dangerous to his body. Then, at night when the temperature is cool, his body can rest from the heat. But, if the temperature does not cool down at night, this causes serious problems for his body. His body has no time to recover.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The human body reacts to heat through its own cooling system. When we get too hot, our skin begins releasing water on its surface. This sweat on the outside of the body evaporates into the air. As the sweat evaporates off the body, the person gets cooler.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This natural cooling system works well for short periods of time. But it is possible for a person to release too much water as sweat. If he does not put enough water back into his body, he could become dehydrated. Dehydration is one of the most common problems in hot weather or a heat wave. Someone who is dehydrated may have trouble thinking or working. This is because lack of water affects the working of the brain.",

                    "There are three main illnesses that come from extreme heat. These are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Heat cramps are quick painful muscle movements that a person cannot control. A person can get heat cramps when she is in very hot weather and has not had enough water. They are most common when a person has also been doing a lot of physical activity. If a person has heat cramps, you should move her to a cool place. Then give her plenty of liquids. A sports drink is a good choice. But coconut water, milk, or water are also very good in this situation.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Heat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. A person with heat exhaustion may have cool wet skin. He may sweat a lot and feel dizzy or faint. He may feel as if he will be sick or have a headache. His heart will beat quickly, but weakly. He may even fall to the ground. If it is not treated, it can be very serious.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Heat exhaustion can develop quickly. But it may also develop slowly over a few days. Often, the victim may not even observe the changes and problems happening in his body.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "During heat exhaustion, his body is trying to make his body temperature normal again. You can help his body cool down. A person with heat exhaustion should immediately stop working. He should rest in a cool place. They should remove any warm clothing. You can give him cool, wet clothes to put on his skin. And most importantly, he should drink liquids like sports drinks, coconut water, milk, or water.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "If heat exhaustion goes untreated, it may develop into heatstroke. This is the most damaging and dangerous problem that comes from hot weather. During heatstroke a person’s average body temperature rises to over 40 degrees Celsius.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "One sign of heatstroke is that the person becomes confused. He may not be able to answer simple questions. The person’s skin may be dry and red or lighter than normal. He may feel as if he will be sick. And he may take short fast breaths and have a fast but quiet heartbeat.",

                    "If you think someone is suffering from heat stroke, it is very important to help them. Here is what you can do. Remove the person from the heat. Take off his clothes and pour cool water over his body. The water will begin to evaporate and help to cool him down. Place a cool, wet cloth on his skin under his arms and on his neck. Blood vessels are very close to the skin in these areas. The cloth will help to cool his blood and his body. Make sure you get emergency help as soon as you can.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Try to stay out of the sun. Use a sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun. Sun can badly burn a person’s body. This affects your body’s ability to cool itself.

But most of our food does not come from cities. It comes from the country. This means that people living in cities must ship food into the city. The food must come from even farther if it is not in season. Some fruits, like avocados, can travel for thousands of miles before people buy them. This uses a lot of fuel. Food producers must also use preservatives to keep the food fresh. This damages the environment. It also adds to climate change.",

                    "People often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in cold weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Today’s Spotlight is on how to stay safe in cold weather.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "One of the biggest dangers of the cold is called hypothermia. A person gets hypothermia when their body temperature gets too low. The human body naturally regulates its own temperature. When it is too hot, we sweat. When it is too cold, our bodies try to make heat. When a person is in the cold, it is almost like they are exercising. Their body is working extra hard to keep the temperature at the right level.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But sometimes, the body cannot create heat fast enough. Or, it has no more energy to use. When this happens, the body’s temperature begins to drop. Soon after, the brain stops working correctly. This is one of the first signs of hypothermia. A person with hypothermia may have a difficult time remembering things. They may be confused, tired, or have a difficult time moving. This makes it even more difficult to get help.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Hypothermia usually happens when a person is out in the cold for too long or they are not wearing enough clothing. Without proper clothing, the body will lose heat even more quickly. Strong wind can also lead to hypothermia. If it is very windy, the air will carry off heat from the body faster. This is why windy weather feels colder than it actually is. It causes us to lose more heat.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When a person has hypothermia, it is important to help them as soon as possible. Here is how you can do that. Bring them inside into a warm room. If they are awake, make them a warm drink. Try to warm the center of their body first: the chest, neck, head, and groin. Keep the person dry. If they have wet clothes, remove them. When a person is wet, their body will lose heat faster. Keep them wrapped in dry blankets. And most importantly, get them emergency help.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Being in the extreme cold can also lead to frostbite. Frostbite is an injury where part of a person’s body freezes. When this happens, the water in their body turns into ice crystals. These crystals damage the body parts. And they make it impossible for blood to flow. Frostbite usually affects the body’s smaller parts like toes, fingers, cheeks, nose, and ears. A person who has frostbite will not be able to feel the affected area. The skin will get hard and change color. In extreme cases, frostbite can damage organs and skin.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "If you have never been in the cold, it can be difficult to understand the unique pain of frostbite. It is like being burned. But you are being burned by the cold. With very bad cases of frostbite, a person might not even feel it. Sir Ranulph Fiennes is a famous explorer who once had a bad case of frostbite. He was exploring in the artic when his supplies fell in the water. He had to reach in to pull them out. He told the magazine Esquire what happened next:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“The water was not all that cold. It was probably about 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But when I got my arm out of the water, it started getting cold very quickly. My fingers felt like dead wood. I could not bend them.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sir Fiennes had fourth-degree frostbite in his fingers. There are four different types, or degrees, of frostbite. A person with a fourth-degree frostbite may never feel the affected area again. The area may die. In the most extreme cases, it may even fall off. In Sir Fiennes’ case, he lost most of his fingers. He was very lucky to not lose his hand.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "If someone has frostbite, it is very important to get them to a warm place. Place the affected area in warm water. Keep the area protected. Do not touch the area with frostbite. Moving or rubbing the area can cause more damage. When the area has warmed again, give the person pain medication. When blood returns to a frostbitten area, it can be very painful. You should also get them emergency care. Doctors may be able to save an area from dying.",

                    "Many people may not recognize symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite. But it is important to know how to prevent them. Here are some suggestions on how to stay safe in cold weather:",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Wear layers of clothing and cover all areas of skin. Wearing the proper clothing is very important in cold weather. It will keep the heat of your body close to your body. And clothing will protect you from the wind. It is very important to cover your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. These areas keep the least heat. They are very vulnerable to frostbite.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Keep yourself dry. If you are sweating in cold weather, you may be wearing too much. Take off a layer of clothing. You will still be protected, but you will not be wet.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Avoid drinking alcohol when you are in the cold for a long time. Alcohol opens up a person’s blood vessels. Blood will rush away from the important parts of a person’s body. Blood carries heat. So, a person will lose heat in the important areas of the body.",

But still, scientists do not know much about what happens to a person’s body when they go to space. This is why Scott Kelly is so important. He is an identical twin.",

                    "Scott Kelly has a brother named Mark Kelly. They look almost exactly alike – they are identical. But, most importantly, they have the same genes. Scientists examined the twins before Scott went to space. When he was in space, Scott sent the scientists genetic samples. And, when he came back, they examined both twins again. They could then compare the results. They could compare, scientifically, what space did to Scott’s body.",

                    "Space is a very different environment than Earth. And human bodies are not very used to it. Most of this has to do with the lack of gravity. Living without gravity would be very strange for most of us. For example, you cannot drink from a cup in space. Water will not stay inside. Water floats in a ball in the open. Instead, you must drink from a pouch, or a straw. Using the toilet can also be a messy business. People on the ISS have special machines to capture their waste. Otherwise, it would float around, and contaminate the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But living in space means more than just changing your environment. It actually changes a person’s body. When Scott Kelly entered the ISS, there was no gravity pushing down his spine. So, his spine got longer. In space, he was about three centimetres taller than on earth. He also did not have to use his muscles much. In space, you can float in one direction just by lightly kicking a wall. Or you can guide yourself with your hands. This sounds very fun. But it also means muscles atrophy and lose their power to move. If a person were to go from space to earth, it would be very difficult for them to move. So, people living in space must exercise a lot. This also keeps their bones strong and healthy.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But other changes happened to Scott Kelly that no one had seen before. The way his genes worked changed. People’s genes do not change. But a person’s environment can change what those genes do. Scientists call this gene expression. If a person is in a very stressful environment, different genes will express themselves. Scott Kelly was in a very strange environment. So his genes started expressing themselves differently. Christopher Mason is a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. He also helped study Scott and Mark. He spoke about the study at a conference.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“As soon as Scott got into space there was a huge change in over 1000 genes that are changing a lot. So clearly the body and cells were adapting to this new environment of space.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Few of these changes hurt Scott Kelly. Some even made his immune system stronger. But being in space for a year did have some negative effects. The shape of his eyes changed. His vision got worse. His blood vessels became swollen. He got greater risk of heart disease. Scott also encountered some radiation in space. This means he has a higher risk for cancer.",

                    "After 340 days, Scott Kelly returned to earth. But even after he left space, scientists continued studying him. Most of the changes did not last long. Some of his DNA was damaged. And, he had a harder time thinking as quickly as before. But several months afterward, he reported feeling normal again.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "These results are very important for future space travel. Not everyone’s bodies will change like Scott’s. Space affects everyone differently. It even affects women differently than men. But Scott Kelly’s year in space will help predict things that might go wrong. And it can help prevent these problems in the future.",

It is difficult to understand how the body might change even farther from earth. People traveling to other planets would be in space even longer. And they would encounter a lot of radiation. But probably, this will not stop the next generation of explorers. Space is just too strange. And what you might find there is too interesting. Scott Kelly has retired from NASA. But he still wants to go to space. John Logsdon is a historian. He studies the history of space travel. He spoke to Scott Kelly in 2018 about what it is like in space. Kelly said:",

At this time, there were probably millions of koalas in Eastern Australia. The number is much smaller now. The Australian Koala Foundation says there are only about forty to eighty thousand koalas left. This sounds like a big number. However, koalas are in serious danger.",

Trees provide shelter, food and safety for the koalas. Humans also build fences, drive vehicles and own dogs. These things can all be dangerous to a koala. Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles. They are even dying from simple things – like a person who cuts down several eucalyptus trees around his house.”",

It can make koalas fight each other. Diseases can also make koalas unable to produce babies. This is a big problem because the number of koalas is shrinking.

But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.",

                    "Over the years, the Dutch have developed many ways of keeping water out of the land. They built huge walls across lakes and the sea coast. These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.",

When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "But there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.",

In this program, the Dutch ask people to leave some low areas near rivers. Or, they repurpose public places. If there is a flood, these areas will fill first.

Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood.

                    "Imagine the inside of a laboratory. Men and women in white lab coats bend over long tables. One woman is working over a small plastic dish. She takes a small container of liquid and empties it into the dish. Then, she squeezes several drops of a different liquid from a long tube. She seals the dish, and places it in a container with several more dishes.",

By the end of the six weeks, it fills the dish. It looks like a hamburger! But does it taste like one? The woman returns to the laboratory and chooses one dish. She brings it into a kitchen and places the substance on a hot pan. Once it is brown, she puts it between two pieces of bread. Then, she takes a big bite!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This may seem like something from a futuristic film. But the woman has just taken her first bite of lab-grown, or in vitro, meat. Many people think this new technology can help solve many problems in the world of meat production. But will people really eat it? Today’s Spotlight is on in vitro meat.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many people around the world love meat. People eat pigs, chicken, cows, goats, and many other animals. Meat is an important part of the world’s diet. For some, meals with meat are important to who they are. Many regional foods depend on meat for their uniqueness.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But there is also a big problem with meat. Raising animals takes up a lot of space, food, and water. And the global population is increasing. As more people come to live on the earth, they will demand more meat. But the earth may not have enough space to keep these animals.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Raising livestock animals also has a serious effect on climate change. Some animals, like cows, goats, and sheep, have special stomachs. These stomachs allow them to eat foods that are very hard to digest, like grasses and leaves. But digesting these foods produces a lot of methane gas. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. It traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide. And the global meat industry is responsible for 30 percent of the world’s methane production! If the world continues to produce meat like this, it could be very bad for the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "For some people, growing meat in laboratories may be the solution to this problem. Meat grown with this method is usually called cultured meat, lab-grown meat, or in vitro meat. To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Cultured meat could address all the problems related to industrial meat production. It addresses environmental impacts and concerns about treating animals well. It stops the risks of getting diseases from animals. It can do all this while making sure there is a production system to meet the growth in demand for animal protein.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "For people like Specht, in vitro meat could solve many of our problems. But the technology for in vitro meat is still very new. And it is still very expensive. Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce. But a meal of this chicken will cost about 17 dollars.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The process also may not be as environmentally friendly as people thought. Growing in vitro meat uses a lot of energy. Some of this energy will come from burning fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. And it lasts in the atmosphere longer than methane. So, many people say it is worse for the planet in the long-term.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Growing in vitro meat may also cause a lot of waste. This is because cell cultures must be sterile. They must be free of any bacteria. Otherwise, other things will grow, and ruin the meat. These sterile containers also create a lot of plastic waste. And there is already a problem of too much plastic waste in the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the biggest question about in vitro meat might be: will people eat it? Many people do not trust food grown in a lab. In vitro meat may seem unnatural. Or people might fear that it will somehow affect their bodies in a bad way. And in vitro meat also does not taste like meat from animals. It does not have fat, only muscle. Fat must be added later, and the taste is still not quite the same.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Still, in vitro meat is coming. Today, it is available in very few places. But dozens of companies are working on their meat growing methods. Companies have invested billions of dollars in this research. And many people believe that it is the protein of the future. Josh Tetrick is the CEO of Eat Just, which grows in vitro chicken. He told the website CNET.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "One hundred years ago. The night was dark. The sea was rough. The waves were high. And the wind was strong. The sailor was worried. He had sailed a long way. And he knew that he was close to land and dangerous rocks. If he sailed too close to the rocks, they would wreck his boat. He could drown.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But then he saw it! He saw something that would keep him and his boat safe. He saw a bright light in the distance. The light was shining on and then off. He stopped worrying. It was a lighthouse. This tall building, a tower with a bright light at its top, would guide him. It warned those at sea to keep away from the rocks around it. With its light, the sailor knew where to sail to keep safe. Lighthouses like this have been guides for sailors for hundreds of years. But what is their future? Today’s Spotlight is on lighthouses.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Imagine a world without GPS or computers. How would you know where you are in the dark? Sailors depended on lighthouses for many hundreds of years. They were built on the coast, on islands, rocks, and even the sea floor. Lighthouses guided sailors. The lights showed sailors where to sail and where not to sail. But lighthouses also helped sailors to identify where they were. Each lighthouse was different. Each had its own colours and marks. And each lighthouse had its own system or pattern of light flashes. So sailors knew where they were just by looking at the lighthouse both in the day and at night.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Before lighthouses existed, fires on top of hills sometimes guided sailors. Later, people built towers to make the fires more noticeable. The first known lighthouse was the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt. It was built over 2000 years ago. For many centuries, this lighthouse was one of the tallest buildings in the world. It was about 106 meters tall.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "That ancient lighthouse no longer exists. But some other ancient lighthouses do. The Tower of Hercules in north-west Spain, is one such lighthouse. It was built by the Romans during the first or second century. This lighthouse is the oldest working lighthouse in the world. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Experts say that the age of modern lighthouses began in the 18th century. In this period engineers improved the way that lighthouses were lit. Some lighthouses used coal fires to create the important light. Others still used wood fires. And some used oil lights or even wax candles. But all these forms of light produced smoke. And the smoke made the glass of the lighthouse black and dirty. When the glass was dirty, sailors could not see the light.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But in 1782 a Swiss scientist solved the problem. He invented a method of burning oil that did not produce smoke. Other engineers produced equipment to increase the intensity or power of the light.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Over the years, lighthouses used different methods of shining a light out into the sea. But in every case, someone needed to look after the light in the lighthouse. Someone had to light it at night. Someone had to keep the equipment working. So, lighthouse keepers were needed. George Medlicott was a lighthouse keeper in the United Kingdom for 32 years. He told the Independent about his memories of living and working in a lighthouse.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "‘It was not an easy job. Some of the lighthouses did not have running water, working toilets or heating. Winters were not great. We stayed in small rooms and often spent hours in the dark.’",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Often a lighthouse keeper had to live away from his family. But sometimes his family stayed with him. Ebonee Gregory had an unusual time as a child. Her father was an assistant lighthouse keeper. She lived with him on a lonely island off the coast of Australia. She told the Guardian about his job and how it affected her.",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "‘My father helped the head lighthouse keeper run and care for the lighthouse and island. They took turns to turn the light on every night and off in the morning. They cleaned the glass. They made weather reports. Our food arrived by air every two weeks along with any letters. If there was bad weather, the food drops would be delayed. I did not have any friends. A picture of my second birthday party shows no one my age, just the two families on the island.’",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But times have changed for lighthouses. New technology for lighthouses and navigation has arrived. Soon there may be no lighthouse keepers living in lighthouses. Many countries including Australia, Finland, Ireland, and Japan no longer employ lighthouse keepers.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Punta Carena is an important lighthouse on the edge of the island of Capri in Italy. Lighthouse keepers worked there for over 151 years. But now its last lighthouse keeper has left. Carlo D’Oriano was the last lighthouse keeper of Punta Carena. He did not want to leave. He felt that it was important to have a person in a lighthouse in case anything went wrong with the technology. As he prepared to leave his lighthouse home and job he talked with the BBC. He remembered storm waves crashing into his window 25 metres up the lighthouse. He remembered storm winds that made the lighthouse shake.",
                    "Voice5",
                    "‘At first I believed these shakes were small earthquakes or shocks. But over the years I have learned that the anger of the sea is more beautiful than a quiet sea. It makes you remember that nature exists and that this mass of water is open and alive. Only someone who lives alone can understand this. My heart is here. When I can no longer keep the light, I think part of me will turn off too.”",

He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Bees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Bees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.",

He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.",

                    "The year was 1707. The English ships were in heavy seas. The Weather was bad, and they were lost. The chief of the ships was Admiral Shovell. His officers made an estimate of the ships’ position. But they were wrong. Suddenly, someone shouted ‘Land!’ This call filled the sailors with fear. There should be no land here. They were in the wrong place. Four of the ships crashed into the land. Over 1,600 men died that night. Only 26 survived. It was one of the worst British sea accidents in history. Today’s Spotlight is on one unexpected result of this accident.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "At the time of the accident, England depended on the shipping industry. Ships brought the people of England sugar, spices, and tea. The people who sailed the ships needed good maps.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But they also needed something more.  They needed to avoid accidents like the loss of Admiral Shovell’s ships. To do this they needed to know exactly where they were. If you look at almost any map, it is divided into small squares by lines.  The lines that go from east to west are the latitude lines. And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars. But they could not measure their east-west position, or longitude, by that method. They needed a good way to measure the ship’s ‘longitude’.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "King Charles the Second of England knew how important it was to solve this problem.  If the problem was not solved, more ships could be lost. In 1675, King Charles ordered the building of the Royal Observatory. The Observatory was a place where people could study the stars. They could work on the problem of establishing longitude at sea. The King created the Observatory in Greenwich.",
                    "The first chief of the Observatory was John Flamsteed. Falmsteed worked hard, but he could not solve the longitude problem. And after the loss of Admirals Shovell’s ships, there was even more pressure to find a solution. So in 1714 the British Government offered a prize of GBP 20,0009. The prize would go to the first person who could find a method of measuring longitude at sea. Some people thought that this would never by possible.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Our story moves on, to one man – John Harrison. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1693. He was 21 years old when the government offered the prize. Like his father, he was a carpenter. He made things with wood. He did not have much education. But John was very good at making clocks. At that time, all clocks were made from wood. But John made many improvements to the clock design. His clocks did not break, like other clocks. And his clocks were very accurate. Each month they lost or gained no more than one second. They were more accurate than many of the best clocks in London. Three of these clocks still exist. And they are still very accurate!",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Harrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "It took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "However, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Harrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "So in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.",

                    "Nicholas Cugnot was a French inventor. He built the first car in the late 1700’s. It used steam to power its engines. And it could drive at speeds of about 7 kilometres per hour. But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use. But cars did not become popular until someone invented a different kind of engine.",

But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.",

Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars. Many other car companies also used Ford’s methods. Cars began to cost less money all over the world.",

Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!",

But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines.

                    "Today, social media websites are a huge part of many people’s lives. The website Facebook is only 10 years old. Yet more than 1 billion people use it! Websites like Facebook help people connect with each other, even when they live far away from each other. Social media websites can spread information very quickly. And most importantly, they are not limited by national borders. Using social media, citizens from different countries can communicate with each other. They can share ideas, learn about each other and become friends – even when they are supposed to be enemies. Today’s Spotlight is on a social media movement that encourages friendship and peace between the citizens of two political enemies.",

But in 2012, relations between Israel and Iran got especially tense. News media and political leaders were talking about nuclear war. But many ordinary citizens, on both sides, did not want war.",

                    "Ronny Edry was one of these people. Edry is an Israeli citizen. And he wanted to communicate a different message. Edry is a graphic designer. He uses computers to design and create images. On March 14th, 2012, he created a picture with a message. In the picture, Edry was holding his young daughter. And his young daughter was holding the flag of Israel. The words on the picture said, “Iranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.” Edry put the picture on his Facebook website. The very next day, hundreds of people were talking about his picture on Facebook.",

One young woman from Iran told Edry that she asked her whole family to come to her house to look at his picture. She said that they all sat together looking at her computer. And they were all crying.

They asked him to add the message from his image to their pictures. Edry received so many requests that he had to ask other graphic designers to help him. Israeli citizens from all over began posting pictures on Facebook with the same words: “Iranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But Israelis were not the only ones to join Edry. Iranians also began to post pictures of their own. Graphic designers from Iran made many pictures that said, “We love you too” and “My Israeli friends: I do not hate you. I do not want war.” Suddenly, thousands of Israeli and Iranian citizens were communicating messages of love and peace to one another. This new community created two Facebook websites – one called “Israel loves Iran” and another called “Iran loves Israel.” In his TED Talk, Edry said,",

                    "But how much power do these new images have? Can they truly change things? It is easy to put an image on Facebook of someone holding a heart that says “I love Iran.” But does it have the same power as a news media image of world leaders signing a peace agreement? Edry believes his pictures do have great power. He believes that such pictures force people to see their enemies as human beings. And when this happens, it is much harder to want to kill them.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It has been over two years since Edry put that first “Israel Loves Iran” picture on Facebook. Since that time, Israel and Iran have not signed any peace agreements. Nor have they made any major changes in their policies. But hundreds of thousands of their citizens are connecting with each other in new ways through social media. And millions of people from around the world have visited the Facebook sites – liking and commenting on pictures, putting up their own pictures, and sharing their messages of peace.",

A teacher at a school nearby discussed this act of vandalism with his students. The children wanted to fight this form of hate crime. They decided to paint over the hateful words.

                    "Hate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the fifth way to fight hate in your community: Educate Yourself.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "How can a community understand people who do hate crimes? How can they react to such violence and hate? The SPLC says that researching the facts about hate groups and hate crimes can be one answer. They call this educating yourself. When people have the facts about a hate group, they can fight hate. Communities must know about hate groups and hate crime before they can react to them and stop them. But knowledge can also help people stop hating. Hate usually comes from fear. And understanding can defeat fear.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "A hate crime often starts with a bias. A bias is an opinion about someone who is different from you. A person often makes a bias because he does not understand people from another group. Often, we do not know people who belong to different religious or racial groups than ourselves. If we have never met someone from that group, we can easily form wrong opinions about them. These biases might be negative. Sometimes they encourage prejudices and hate.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Every person has biases. Often, people do not even know their own biases. But they express biases in many forms. A person can express his bias in words or actions. The SPLC calls some incidents “bias incidents.” For example, a racial joke is a bias incident. Bias incidents do not involve criminal acts like beatings, starting fires, or damaging property.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Hate groups try to use and encourage the biases people already feel. In fact, hate groups are usually very skilled at spreading their biases. They use propaganda. Propaganda is bias information that people use to spread a particular message. These hateful messages can appear as a painting on the side of a building, on a paper hanging in a local store, or even sometimes on television or the radio.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Hate propaganda influences how people think of each other. It tries to represent groups of people as less than human. Slowly, members of a community begin to think that a particular group of people is not important or is harmful. Angry, scared individuals may attack the minority group. These criminals believe that their actions are accepted. They may even believe that they are doing good work.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The SPLC says that most hate crimes are not committed by hate groups. They are committed by individuals, alone or in small groups. These individuals have listened to hate propaganda. They let their biases influence bad actions. These criminal actions are hate crimes.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Any criminal act done against someone because of a bias is a hate crime. Attacking someone because of their religion, race, sexual history, sex, or disability is wrong. It is a hate crime. Many areas punish hate crimes severely. But how do we stop hate crimes from happening?",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "First, it is important to try and understand your own biases. What do you know about people who are different to you? The first step is to learn about people who are different to you. Try to understand them. Learn about them. When we understand and listen to each other, we learn to accept our differences. Continue investigating your own biases.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Second, if you observe or experience a hate crime, try to find out if a hate group was involved. You can also research facts about the particular hate group you are trying to stop. What does the group want? What signs or symbols represent the group?",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Experts say that members of hate groups often want to divide communities. They want to separate a community into racial, ethnic or religious groups. They may want to give particular groups in the community limited rights. Many do not respect or recognize the authority of the government. And they try to harm people who oppose them and their ideas.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When you know about the hate groups in your area, you are more prepared to fight against the hate they represent. If you have children, talk to them about how they should react to hate. Share information you have learned with your community.",

Celebrate every kind of culture represented in your community. Include as many different cultures in your celebration as you can. Celebrate the different religions in your community.

                    "Good and effective leaders can do much to fight hate in a community. In fact, the SPLC says that “the fight against hate needs community leaders willing to take an active role.” Community leaders must ACT. They must use their authority to fight against hate. They must be good examples for people to follow.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Sometimes it is difficult for leaders to act against hate. A leader may fear losing supporters or his job. Or a leader may not have a close relationship with the people she leads. That is why the SPLC encourages people to pressure leaders. People can come together. They can influence and educate their leaders. Leaders can then lead a community to helpful change. So, how can you encourage your leaders to lead a fight against hate? How can you influence them toward change? How can you pressure your leaders?",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "First, the SPLC says to form relationships with your community leaders. Leaders and communities who are close can communicate their needs better.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Second, you can educate your community leaders about hate. Help them understand the causes and effects of hate. Leaders may not understand that hate affects every member of a community. Hate is a serious community problem. When good leaders know the facts about hate, they want to stop it quickly.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Third, the SPLC says we need to demand that authorities react to a hate-based incident or a hate crime quickly and seriously. It is important that authorities completely investigate hate-based crimes. Local media like newspapers, radio, and television often report on crimes in an area. The media can show people the effects of hate. The media can encourage communities to accept other people no matter who they are or what they believe.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Fourth, expect leaders to speak against hate-based incidents strongly and publicly when they do happen. Leaders represent large groups of people. When a leader speaks against hate, she influences her listeners. She also influences her listeners when she speaks for tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means to respect every person equally. If a leader does not speak against hate, she is still sending a message. She sends a message that the community accepts hate.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Fifth, leaders must clearly name the problem. Sometimes it is difficult to speak clearly and openly about hate. Leaders may try to avoid using the word “hate.” Or they may try to forget about the problem. But forgetting about the problem of hate makes victims of hate crimes feel unsupported. A community without honesty becomes divided. It suffers. And it lets hate continue.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Lastly pressure your leaders when they do not act. Leaders in a community must be involved in the fight against hate. Ask leaders to be involved by speaking at peace events. Ask them to attend community meetings. Ask them to help create long-term ways to solve the problem of hate. Leaders who fight against hate have stronger communities. Victims in their communities feel supported. Whole communities feel safer. And they know how to react to future hate-based incidents.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These are all good ways to pressure your leaders to encourage tolerance. But what happens when a leader makes a racist comment? What happens when elected officials, police, or community leaders encourage hate instead of tolerance?",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The SPLC believes that community members have power to encourage, or pressure, leaders in that case too. The SPLC encourages community members to put pressure on hate-filled leaders. They say you can organize a group of people who believe in tolerance. Encourage your group to write letters to the leader. Encourage your group to organize public events. Leaders who encourage hate will damage their communities.

Time is not the same in Beijing’s underground city, away from the sun. Xi dresses quickly in his small room. It is so small that he must duck down to keep his head low when he stands. He gathers a suitcase full of Buddhist prayer beads. Above the ground, he will sell these beads on a street corner. But now he must begin the long trip to the surface. He ducks through short hallways. He drags the suitcase up cracked stairs. He passes other small rooms like his, full of people. Finally, he reaches a door that opens to the street. Cars rumble past him. It is the first time he has felt fresh air all day.",

They come to cook in restaurants. Then, when their jobs are done, they go back to these doors. Together, they disappear underground. It is like they were never there.

                    "Beijing is one of the largest cities in the world. Over 20 million people live there. It is also the capital of China. It is the country’s cultural center. Because of this, there are many opportunities for work in Beijing. People travel from all over the country to live in Beijing. They move there to follow their dreams.",

                    "But many of these people are not wealthy. And housing in the city is extremely expensive. Some people do not have permits to work there. So, they must find homes somewhere else. Many settle in the basements and tunnels of Beijing. They become members of the rat tribe. Rooms underneath the city are very inexpensive. They cost about half as much as the rooms above ground. They are not good rooms. Many are very small. People living there must share toilets and kitchens with many different households.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These rooms were not built for people to live in permanently. Some were not even meant for people. The Government of China built many of these rooms as bunkers in the 1960s. These underground structures are where people would go in case of a bomb attack. For a long time, the government of China feared war. They required most buildings to be built with bunkers beneath them. They even built a huge, public bunker. Local people call this bunker The Underground City. The Underground City was over 85 square kilometers wide!",

                    "But when war never came, owners of these buildings began to sell space for rooms. The government even allowed people to rent spaces in the Underground City. Some of these rooms were meant for people. But some had to be changed. Places meant for food became places where people could stay. Cold concrete rooms changed into cozy living spaces. More and more people moved to Beijing. There was no room for them. So, they moved into the bunkers. Today, there may be over a million people living underground.",

                    "“The first basement I stayed at in Beijing was very large. But it was very humid, with a lot of water in the air. After one month it was still smelly. There was water on the floor from the humidity, and things got moldy. So I moved. Then I found this room. It is about eight square meters for 360 yuan. I have no income, so I live here. It is ok. I do feel uncomfortable here, though. I always feel very tired. Maybe because there is no sunlight here.”",

                    "Many people of the rat tribe also feel a great shame about living underground. They may not share where they live with their families or friends. Some may like their living situation, but their families object. It can cause tension between family members. Zhang Xi is an immigrant from Mongolia who is a member of the rat tribe.

                    "Living as a member of the rat tribe is also difficult for another reason. In 2012, it became illegal. Chinese authorities now believe that these bunker rooms are not safe. Many do not have fire escapes. If a basement were to flood, many people would die. Members of the rat tribe are willing to take this risk. But the city of Beijing is not. In 2015, they evicted 120,000 people living underground. Every one of them lost their homes. There was nowhere for them to go. So, while there is danger living underground, there is also a danger of having no home at all.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Still, most members of the rat tribe do not believe that their situation is permanent. Even if their homes are illegal, they still persist. They plan to save their money, until they can purchase a better house. Some wait until they can get a better job. Living underground is one step on a road that leads to a better life.

                    "This example was part of a real experiment. All over the world, researchers entered hotels. They went to police stations and banks. They turned in wallets. Some wallets had more money, and some had less. The goal was to see when people returned the wallets and why. Researchers dropped over 17,000 wallets in 40 different countries. Then they waited for the results.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Before the study, most researchers believed that people would take the wallets with more money. More money would give people more reason to steal. But this did not happen! Instead, people were more likely to turn in the wallets with more money. This was true in almost every country. More people also returned the wallet if there was a key in it.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Researchers believe that there are two reasons for their results. First, people do not want to believe that they are bad. Stealing is illegal in almost every country. When there was more money in the wallet, it felt more like they were stealing. They returned the wallets because they did not want to seem like bad people.",

                    "“This study shows in a very natural way that our choices about dishonesty are not rational. We do not think in terms of costs and benefits. We think about what we feel comfortable with socially.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The second reason researchers believe people returned wallets with more money and items is because they felt bad for the owner of the wallet. Everyone knows what it feels like to lose something. You become panicked or distressed. You search and do not stop. This is especially true if you lose something important to you.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Empathy is the ability to understand another person’s experiences. We think about how we might feel if we lost a wallet full of money. This also affects situations where we lie. It is easier to lie when the lie is small or if we think what we do will not change anything. But if we think about how we feel when someone lies, we may not do it. In this way, honesty depends on empathy.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "How honest we are also depends on our own needs. A person may be more willing to lie if they need something very badly.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "How honest we are also changes when dealing with different people. Stereotypes are beliefs we have about people without really knowing them. These beliefs about groups of people shape our behavior. They make it more difficult to feel empathy. Imagine that you believe that all people from a particular country lie. You may dislike them, even though you do not know much about them. You may be honest toward everyone else. But you may not believe that people from this country deserve honesty. You may not be honest, because you do not believe those people will be honest.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But how honest you are also can also depend on where you are from. David Hugh-Jones is a researcher at The University of East Anglia. In 2015, he decided to study what honesty looked like in different countries. He created an experiment. He asked people from many different countries to report the results of a coin flip. The person in the experiment would throw the coin in the air. If the coin landed on heads, the person would get money. If it landed on tails, they got nothing. Hugh-Jones also had people answer questions about music. Correct answers would also get a reward. People in the study could easily cheat. But the questions were very difficult. Almost no one would know them. So Hugh-Jones would know when they were honest or not.",

                    "Hugh-Jones found that the U.K. was the most honest in the coin flip. But Japan was the most honest in the music quiz. And other countries had different levels of honesty. The two different tests showed that people were honest about some things, but not honest about other things. This could have to do with cultural differences about honesty.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Almost every culture values honesty. But it is not always easy to be honest. Telling the truth can be difficult. Most of the time, we lie to stay safe. Judi Ketteler is a journalist who reports on honesty. She wrote for Scientific American:",

                    "“In relationships, we lie to make people feel better or to avoid awkward situations. But we also do not like it when our romantic partner lies to us. We lie to ourselves as well, believing that we are smarter than we are. Children will lie more often if other people have lied to them. We even lie if we are afraid the truth will look like a lie. And of course, we also lie on social media.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These lies can keep us happy. They help us avoid difficult situations. But lying also causes negative emotions like worry. It can make you think everyone else is lying too. And most of the time, lying is not even necessary. Ketteler says:",

                    "“We often think being honest will be more difficult than it is. In fact, people find that being honest makes relationships better. It improves social connections more than they expect.”",

                    "So, how can you be more honest? Ketteler offers this advice: A good start is to watch when you lie. Why are you not being honest? What will happen if you speak the truth? Try to stop the small lies first. You may find the bigger lies will also stop soon after.",

Then, a third man passes by. He is not from the man’s country. Instead, he is from a foreign country. In fact, these two countries are at war. But instead of passing by, this third man stops. The third man shows kindness. He helps the injured man onto his donkey. He takes him into his home. He cares for the injured man, and nurses him back to health.

Most religions have stories like this. Most religions tell us to be kind to each other. These may seem like commands given with little reason. But did you know there are also scientific reasons why a person should be kind? Kind people are happier. And they may even live longer! Today’s Spotlight is on the science of being kind.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Most people know that being kind feels good. Helping someone in need makes us feel positive. And giving a gift to a friend feels as good as receiving one. But for most of human history, no one could say why. Giacomo Rizzolatti is an Italian Scientist. He studies how the brain works. In the 1980s, he and his colleagues performed an experiment that showed a lot about kindness. Rizzolatti used electrical scans to examine the brains of monkeys. When a monkey did something, part of the brain would show activity.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Then, Rizzolatti discovered something amazing. Sometimes, the monkeys would watch each other. When watching, their brains were also active. But they were active in the same way the other monkeys were. When one monkey reached out his hand, the other monkey’s brain looked as if it were doing the same. It was not reaching out. But the watching monkey’s brain experienced the event as if it were. Only special parts of the brain acted this way. Rizzolatti called them mirror neurons. Soon, he and his colleagues discovered the same thing in humans.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Mirror neurons are very important to the science of kindness. Mirror neurons are the part of our brain that lets us feel what other people feel. They allow us to empathize. V.S. Ramachandran is a neuroscientist. He studies mirror neurons. He spoke to Greater Good Magazine about why he thinks mirror neurons are important for empathy.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“These mirror neurons are involved in empathy for pain. To really empathize with your pain, I need to experience it myself. That is what the mirror neurons are doing. They help me to feel your pain. I experience the same pain as if someone were to hurt me directly. That is the basis for all empathy.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Empathy is the first step toward kindness. It lets us know when people are sad or hurt. We know mirror neurons help us feel other people’s pain. But mirror neurons also allow us to feel when other people are happy. When we see others smile, we often smile. In being kind to others, we feel their happiness.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The happiness we get from being kind also may be good for our health. When we are kind, our brain releases chemicals called neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters make us frightened, or angry. But the neurotransmitters released in kindness have positive effects. They make us feel good about our relationships, and more confident. But they also help our bodies. Oxytocin is one neurotransmitter released during a kind act. Oxytocin prevents stress. But it also lowers blood pressure. Marcie Hall is a psychiatrist at University Hospitals in Ohio in the United States. She spoke to the Healthy@UH podcast about the benefits of these neurotransmitters.",

This is especially true with the problem of hate in a community. So, the SPLC encourages communities to stay engaged.

Instead, he goes to his computer. And, he plays video games for the entire day Sometimes, his mother comes to bring him food. He thanks her, but says nothing else. Ito’s life is the same the next day, and the next. He has lived without seeing other people for the past three years.",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Japan has a very unique society. Traditionally, parents and children live together for many years. Several generations often live together at a time. And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.",

Or, they might be bullied in school. They see these events as failures. And, once they have failed, it is difficult to try again. Masaki Ikegami is a journalist who writes about the hikikomori. He told the Japan Times:",

They have been hurt by their human relationships there. Other cases might be people who have had bad experiences at school.  Or, they have been through troubles, accidents, or illnesses. Some have stopped working to stay at home and look after their aging parents. There are many different reasons. It can happen at any age.”",

                    "Many hikikomori isolate for economic reasons. After the second World War, Japan’s economy grew quickly. College graduates got jobs easily. A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work. Or, they did not find work at all. This economic time period is known as the lost decades.",

                    "The lost decades hurt a lot of people. In Japan, much of a person’s self-worth is based on their job. Not having a job, or not doing well in a job, causes a lot of shame. And some people feel so worthless that they stop trying at all. Naohiro Kimura was a hikikomori for ten years. He told the Japan Times:",

But they feel that they have no worth. They believe their efforts will not change anything. So, they feel even worse, and become more depressed. It is difficult to recover from this way of thinking.",

                    "Then the boat sank under the water. Many of the refugees drowned. The others waited in the sea for rescue. Hours later some of them were saved by boats from the island of Lampedusa near Sicily, in Italy. Fanus was rescued. She told the Guardian about her experience,",

                    "Tuccio wanted to do something for these refugees. He was a carpenter. So he used his skill with wood to do something special. He found wood from their wrecked boat. He thought the wood smelled of salt, the sea and even suffering. Tuccio knew the refugees were Christian believers. So from this wood he made each refugee a Christian symbol of hope.

He also wanted more people to understand what was happening. And so he made larger crosses for many churches in Italy. In 2015, the BBC talked to him for a radio programme. Tuccio told them that he wanted to honour both those who died and those who survived. He explained,",

This famous museum stores and shows objects of permanent value to world history and culture. Cook was moved by Tuccio’s kindness. But she was also excited. A cross made by Tuccio could represent ALL the refugees who had travelled to Europe during this period in history. It could tell their story.

                    "Tuccio made the cross for the museum from wood from the boat that was wrecked in October, 2013. Cook remembers that everyone at the Museum went quiet when they saw the cross. Neil MacGregor was in charge of the Museum. He decided that the simple wooden cross was a very special object. He said,",

                    "“This simple, yet moving, object is a special gift to the collection. Mr Tuccio’s kindness will allow all visitors to the Museum to consider this important time in the history of Europe. It is a great migration which may change the way we understand our continent. In my time at the Museum we have collected many wonderful objects. All of them have tried to shine a light on the needs and hopes that all humans share.”",

                    "Cook still feels strong emotion when she looks at the Lampedusa Cross. Tears come to her eyes. Many visitors to the museum react in the same way. The cross is only about 38 centimetres high. And the blue, green and yellow paint on the wood is damaged. But it is a powerful symbol of both suffering and hope in our time. One visitor told the BBC,",

A group of rebel soldiers surrounded the school.  They were from the Lord’s Resistance Army or the LRA. The soldiers kidnapped all the students. They taught the goys to fight and become soldiers.

                    "Simone was free from the LRA. But she was alone and afraid. Then, she met Sister Angelique Namaika. Sister Angelique helped Simone heal and become independent again.

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sister Angelique Namaika has always known what she wanted to do with her life. When she was 9 years old, she lived in the town of Lege, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She remembers a German nun who visited the town. Angelique watched this female religious worker care for the sick. The nun gave out medicine and talked with the people who came to her. Angelique decided then that she wanted to become a nun too. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,",

                    "And this is exactly what Angelique did. In 2000, Sister Angelique completed the necessary studies to become a nun. In 2003, she began working in the town of Dungu. Dungu has many refugees. These refugees are victims of LRA violence. Like Simone, many of the women and young girls were kidnapped by the LRA. They suffered much fear and violence. They have escaped from the LRA, but they still suffer many problems.",

Many of the young girls have very little education They have not learned any skills to support themselves or their children. So they have no way to earn money.  Sister Angelique quickly recognized what she needed to do. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "So Sister Angelique started teaching the women the local language. She teaches them how to read and write. And she listens to their stories. Often by talking together the women find support. They discover they are not alone. They are a community.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sister Angelique also teaches the women skills they can use to earn money. She teaches some women to sew clothes. Once they are skilled, they can make school clothes and other thins to sell in the market. Sister Angelique teaches other women to cook foods such as bread. They can sell this food in the market or by visiting houses in the community. Sister Angelique even helped a group of women start a garden. Together they panted seeds and cared for the plants. The women used the vegetables and foods from the garden to feed their families. And they sold what remained.",

                    "After a few years, Sister Angelique opened a centre in Dungu. It is called the Centre for Reinsertion and Development Support or CRAD. At this centre, she can teach many women at one time. The women can also come there to use common resources. But some women live too far away from the centre. So Sister Angelique rides her two wheeled bicycle to visit them.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But Sister Angelique’s efforts do not just concentrate on teaching the women. A major part of her work is helping the women re-enter society. She works to help their communities accept them again. Sister Angelique told the Catholic News Service the story of one 14 year old girl.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“One problem she had was that she was rejected by her mother. Her mother said that the girl was responsible or being caught by the LRA. I gave the girl guidance and information.

However, this is an unusual way to make a film. It uses a method called “crowd-sourcing.” Crowd-sourcing is when a large group of people help complete a project usually done by a few paid workers. In crowd-sourcing, the group completes the project for less money or even for free. Usually, there is a public announcement for a crowd-sourced project.

It grows larger and darker by the second as your train speeds toward it. Your train is about to go underground! Now everything in front of you is black as night. The darkness is all you can see for the next four minutes. Then a little spot of light appears. That light tells you that you have reached the other side of the mountain.

                    "This describes the first seven minutes of a seven-hour train ride across the country of Norway. This long train ride was recorded on video from beginning to end. It is the first popular example of Slow TV.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Slow TV is a completely different form of television. In its most basic form, a person sets up a camera on a usually dull or normal activity — like riding a train. Sometimes the camera does not even move. Producers do not write a script. They do not make the video go faster or cut parts out. A person watching the video experiences the event in real time.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The Slow TV train ride video was broadcast on public television in Norway in 2009. Public television in Norway is well-supported. The producers did not have to worry about how much money they could make through this program. They decided the idea was creative. And they were interested to see how people would react.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The train ride was shown on TV on a Friday night. The producers expected that a few thousand people would watch the program. But information about the program spread quickly. That night more than a million people watched this slow train ride. This means more than three times as many people as usual watched TV that night. In fact, people enjoyed the recording so much that they wanted to see more like it. And they wanted the broadcast to stretch on for an even longer amount of time.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The producers were surprised and excited. Their next Slow TV experiment was a boat trip along the coast of Norway. They recorded for five and a half days. All the video was broadcast live on public television. But about two days into the boat trip, something new began to happen. People began to visit the coast to be in the video. Thomas Hellum was one of the producers of the video. He told NPR:",

                    "“More and more people singing, playing instruments, people along the coast and thousands of people showed up at every port, every mountain. They could go find the information and see, when will the boat be in my place? And they could prepare.”",

                    "The video showed people waving flags and holding up signs. Small boats sailed next to the large ship. The Queen of Norway waved to the camera from her own boat. Near the end of the trip, the many colors of a rainbow appeared above a green mountain. While the rainbow hung in the sky, this program broke a record. It was the largest number of people ever to watch a program in Norway at the same time.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "People in Norway continue to enjoy Slow TV. Producers have recorded many different long events. They have recorded meat production, making a coat, and fishing in a stream. And the idea has spread to other countries as well. People have made simple slow TV programs all around the world. However, Norway is the only country where the programs are popular on a national level.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But is there anything for the average person to gain from Slow TV? With hundreds of normal programs to choose from, should you give Slow TV a try? There are several different ways that Slow TV can be of value.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "First, it is important to understand that not all people watch Slow TV in the same way. Even in Norway, only some people sit to watch a single program for hours on end. Many people think of the programs like having a pleasant friend in the room. They turn on the TV to a slow program. Then they continue with their work while the show plays next to them. Calming sounds and beautiful things to look at can be especially nice during lonely times.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another way that people from around the world enjoy Slow TV is as a sort of virtual travel. Maybe they do not have enough money for travel. Or maybe health worries are keeping them home. Watching Slow TV lets people experience other countries. They see through the eyes of someone else walking a street or riding on a train. As they watch the program, they can also read more about the place they are visiting. The place comes alive in their imagination.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Finally, Slow TV can calm the mind. Most television programs speed up faster and faster. They follow simple plot lines with clear stories that are told quickly. Slow TV invites people to take the time to notice the details for themselves. No producer has decided what parts of the story are important. Everything stays in the recording. And just like in life, the person watching gets to decide which parts of the story are worth noticing and wondering about.",

It connected one Game Boy to another. Tajiri wanted people playing the game to collect Pokémon. But he also wanted them to trade Pokémon. They could do this through the link cable. Their Pokémon could even battle. This would give people another reason to play the game. Many video games involve only one person. But in Pokémon, many people could play at once.

                    "Do you recognize this sound? It is the small high noise of the mosquito. Mosquitoes are small insects with wings. They bite people and take blood from their bodies. When mosquitoes bite people they leave behind a small raised red area on the skin. People with mosquito bites may feel like they need to keep rubbing or scratching their skin in this area. These little insects are a problem for people and animals in many parts of the world. Today’s Spotlight is on mosquitoes. These interesting insects are a big problem.",

Some mosquitoes can carry diseases. They can give these diseases to people and animals. And some of these diseases cause death.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But people can stop mosquitoes. Let’s look at the life of the mosquito. When a female mosquito is full grown, she mates with a male mosquito. Then she begins searching for a “host.” A host is a person or animal that she can land on. A mosquito can sense a host from up to 35 meters away.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Most mosquitoes do not travel very far. They usually travel less than a kilometer during their whole life. But some mosquitoes can travel far. Some mosquitoes can travel 160 kilometers in some conditions.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When the female mosquito finds a host, she bites him.  Mosquitoes have a special mouth. When a mosquito bites you, it actually puts part of its mouth under your skin. The mosquito also releases chemicals into your body. These chemicals make your blood flow faster into the mosquito. These chemicals are also responsible for the red bumps that many people experience after a mosquito bite.",

                    "After a mosquito bites her host, she fills herself up with his blood. She is not eating this blood. Instead, she is storing it. This blood will be very important for her babies. They will use the protein in the blood.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Only the female mosquito bites a host for her babies. For food, mosquitoes live on nectar, or sweet liquid that comes from plants. Male mosquitoes live for only a short time after they mate. But a female mosquito can have a few groups of babies without mating again.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Mosquitoes grow through four separate periods of growth. These periods are called the egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This whole process takes about one to two weeks.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When the female mosquito is ready, she lays her eggs. Different kinds of mosquitoes lay their eggs in different places. They can lay their eggs in a small container of water. Or they can lay their eggs in large wet fields. But all mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in some kind of water.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Most eggs hatch in about two days. Then the baby mosquitoes are called larva. The larva lives in the water. During this stage, the larvae grow. They lose their skin four times. This is called “moulting.” After their fourth moult, a larva begins the pupal stage.",

                    "During the pupal stage, young mosquitoes begin to move. They float on the surface of the water. A special skin surrounds the pupa. Inside this skin, the pupa is changing into an adult mosquito. This process takes about two days. When the mosquito is completely developed the skin splits open. And the mosquito is now an adult!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "The adult mosquito comes out from the water. It must rest on the water to dry. Each part of its body must become hard. After its wings have dried, the mosquito can fly. And a short time after that, the mosquito can mate. Then the females go in search of blood to make more little mosquitoes. And the process begins again!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Mosquitoes live in many areas of the world. But mosquitoes live best in a warm climate. And since they have so much contact with blood, they can be very dangerous. Mosquitoes can carry terrible viruses like west Nile, yellow fever, and malaria to humans and animals. These viruses create disease in their human hosts that can kill them. But not all mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. In fact, many mosquitoes do not carry viruses at all. However, it is difficult to know which mosquitoes are dangerous and which ones are not.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many people try to avoid mosquitoes. But have you ever noticed that mosquitoes seem to bite some people more than others? In fact, scientists believe that about 20 percent of people are more likely to get mosquito bites than others. Scientists who study mosquitoes believe that mosquitoes are attracted to, or pulled in, because of particular chemicals that come off people’s bodies. Some people produce more of these chemicals than other people. Mosquitoes can also smell the chemicals in the air a person breathes out.",
                    "Voice 1",

                    "Third, in areas where mosquitoes are dangerous, use screens or nets over sleeping areas. These fabrics have many very small holes. The holes are big enough to let air through. But mosquitoes cannot fit through the holes. Also, nets that are treated with chemicals that kill insects are very helpful for stopping mosquitoes and malaria.",

Aurora was the name that Romans gave to the goddess of the dawn – the rising of the sun. The second half, Borealis, is named after the north wind. So in English Aurora Borealis means “the dawn of the north.”",

                    "Scientists like David Vaughan have worked for decades to find ways to protect the coral reefs. Vaughan is over 60 years old. He has seen the coral reefs decrease over his lifetime. This made him very sad. But one day, he discovered something new to him. It was a very simple technology. And it changed everything for him.

Scientists break the corals into small pieces. The coral grows very quickly using its own natural healing process. Using micro-fragmentation, corals grow 25 to 50 times faster than they would in other situations.",

                    "“I picked up the coral, expecting to see it was worse. But it had completely grown over a hole the size of a large coin. From birth, it took that coral two years to grow to that size and it had grown back in two weeks.”",

They grow the coral in large tanks of water in his research laboratory. Then they put them back into the ocean. They attach the new corals to old corals that have died. Some of the new planted coral has died. But most of it continues to grow. And Dr. Vaughan and his team are learning more every day about how to make the new coral successful.",

Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles. They are even dying from simple things – like a person who cuts down several eucalyptus trees around his house.”",

But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.",

These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.",

When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "But there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.",

Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood.

                    "Bees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "When the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.",

                    "Voice 4",
                    "“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.",

All around, there is green grass and farm land. In the far distance, there is a round target. On the target, there are brightly colored rings or circles.",

                    "One man stands in front of the crowd. He holds a bow – a weapon that shoots arrows. He gently places an arrow on the bow. He pulls the arrow back toward his ear. He carefully aims at the target. He releases the bow. The arrow flies through the air. After 210 meters, the arrow hits the target. The crowd cheers. The archer has set a new world record. He has completed the world’s longest archery shot to hit a target.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Matt Stutzman was born in 1982. When he was born, he did not have arms. He was disabled, but he was healthy in every other way. When Stutzman was 4 months old, his parents decided that they could not care for him.  They wanted someone to adopt him. So, they surrendered their parental rights. They hoped that other parents would care for their son – and make him a part of their family.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When Stutzman was 10 months old, Leon and Jean Stutzman did just that. They adopted him. The Stutzmans raised Matt on their family farm. They loved and cared for him. They taught him to work hard. And even though he had a disability, they encouraged him to try and do anything he wanted to do. Jean Stutzman wrote about Matt’s story on the website mattstutzman.com. She explained,",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Our family plan was to give Matt the freedom to try almost anything – if he could complete it on his own. The natural reaction would have been to quickly enter each situation and help him.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "However, the Stutzmans chose not to help Matt right away. They chose to let him try, fail and try again. If Matt could not find a way to do something, they would help him. But they always let him try alone first.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "This may seem like an unusual way to raise a child with a disability. But Matt Stutzman is thankful for his parents’ teaching. They taught him that if you think something is not possible, then it will not be possible. But if you work hard and believe it is possible, you can achieve great things. Stutzman believes this has helped him succeed at many things in life – including archery. Today, Stutzman lives a completely un-adapted life. He has not changed anything in his home or car to make it easier for him to live without arms. He also does not use prosthetic arms – arms created by doctors and scientists. The way the Stutzmans raised Matt has strongly influenced him. On his website, he explains,",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“I was born without arms. But I was blessed to have two amazing and patient parents that raised me. They taught me a long time ago, that impossible is a way of thinking. And they taught me not to think that way. This has served me well.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Stutzman was blessed with good parents. But he was also born with very good physical skill. Stutzman quickly learned to do many things with his feet. In fact, he could do many things with his feet better than most people could do these same things with their hands. It was clear at an early age that he had good skill and aim.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Stutzman told the Telegraph news organization a funny story about this. When he was young, he used to pull fruit off the trees on his family farm. Often, he would use his feet to kick the fruit at his brother. For most people, kicking a small piece of fruit and aiming it well would be difficult. But Stutzman said he could hit his brother in the head every time! Stutzman recognized at this young age that he had great physical ability. And he learned to use his physical ability to do many things. This helped him as he grew up.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "When Stutzman was 16 years old, he bought his first bow and arrow. He wanted to hunt animals with it. After buying the bow, Stutzman needed to learn how to shoot it without arms. But there was no one to teach him how to do this. Stutzman joked about this with the NPR news organization. He said,",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“If you search the internet using Google and write – ‘how to teach a guy without arms to shoot’ – you will not find that. Usually, you can find anything on Google. But you just cannot find that.”",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "So Stutzman had to teach himself. He learned to hold the bow with his feet. He also learned to use the side of his mouth to guide the release of the arrow from the bow. It is an unusual method for shooting a bow and arrow. But Stutzman believes that his lack of arms is helpful in archery. He told the MSNBC news organization,",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“I believe how I shoot is an advantage. I use my leg and my leg is the strongest part of my body.”",

                    "Stutzman’s skill, method and desire to compete have made him very successful. On October 30, 2011, Stutzman set the World Record for the longest archery shot to hit a target. And in September of 2012, he won a silver medal award at the London Paralympic Games. Stutzman hopes this is just the beginning of his success. He told the KCCI news organization,",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“I want to be the best in world. Not just the best archer with no arms or with a disability. This is what encourages me to keep training and working.”",

Tada was trapped under the water. She wanted to call for help. But she could not open her mouth under the water. No matter how hard she tried, Tada could not get up.

                    "The waiter asks everyone in the group to remove their watches and telephones. He puts these things in a box. Then, these guests form a line. Each person holds the shoulder of the person in front of them. The waiter stands at the front. He walks through one dark cloth curtain, and then another. He leads the group into a room that is completely dark. No one can see anything. It is like they are all blind. In fact, some people in the room are blind. This special restaurant is called Blinde Kuh. It is designed to share the experience of blindness with people who can see. The waiters and many other workers here are blind. Today’s Spotlight is on Blinde Kuh, and the experience of eating in the dark.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The World Health Organization says that around the world about 39 million people are blind. Some people are born blind. Others lose their ability to see in accidents. Some diseases also cause blindness. This is particularly true in places where people cannot get treatment from doctors.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Being blind can be very difficult. In many places, blind people are not given their full human rights. It is difficult for blind people to work. Many blind people have to depend on their families to survive. Sometimes, they must even ask other people for food and money. But what if there was work that only blind people could do? What if there were jobs that used the particular skills of blind people?",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Jorge Speilmann is a Christian leader who lives in Zurich, Switzerland. He is blind. In the late 1990s, he opened the restaurant Blinde Kuh. It won many awards for his interesting business idea. But Speilmann did not start the restaurant to win awards. He did not plan to make a lot of money. Speilmann had two simple goals. He wanted to create jobs for blind people. And he wanted to show people what it is like to be blind.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Speilmann often invited friends into his home to share a meal. They would ask what it was like to be blind. So he would cover their eyes with dark cloth when they ate. His guests found that the meal was very different. They said that they had to concentrate on their food. They listened carefully to the people around them. They found it very interesting. Without their eyes, people use different senses. They concentrate more on hearing, smell, or touch. Food even has a different taste!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Today, there are many restaurants like Blinde Kuh, where people eat in the dark. There are many differences between them. But all of them work in a similar way to Blinde Kuh. Guests enter into a lighted space. Here they order their food or buy drinks. In some of these restaurants, guests can choose a “mystery meal”. They will not know what they are eating. They have to use their other senses to recognize the food! They talk with their friends, and other guests. Some look around the room. They seem worried. This will be the last time they see anything for the next few hours.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Then, a waiter enters. A restaurant waiter usually takes orders and serves food. At the dark dining restaurants, the waiter does more. It is unusual for a blind person to be a guide. But in these restaurants, the waiter is the guide for the guests. To enter the restaurant, one guest holds the waiter’s shoulders. Then, the next guest holds the shoulder of the first guest. Soon the guests form a line behind the waiter. Then, the waiter begins to walk. He leads the guests into the dining room. Here it is very dark. The guests cannot see anything. But the waiter never gets lost. He has done this many times. He does not need to see.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "At many dark dining restaurants, guests do not eat alone. The tables are very large. Everyone sits together. So people may sit next to someone they have never met. Many people find it difficult to eat and talk with strangers. But sitting in the dark, they feel differently. People feel that they can speak without being judged. No one can see at all. So people sometimes do things that they would not normally do. They find a kind of freedom in the dark room.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "There are many difficulties. Guests may spill food or drink. They may drop their forks or knives. Some people cannot easily find their own mouth. Sometimes, people even feel afraid of the new, strange situation. The guests depend on their blind waiter for everything. But for most people, these difficulties are also a chance to learn.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "After eating, guests often talk with their waiters. In some restaurants, waiters even tell stories to the whole group of guests. They talk about their experiences at the restaurant. And they tell stories about the rest of their lives. Blind people are often treated like they are less able than people who can see. They may learn to feel that their experiences are not as important. But the darkness of the restaurant changes this. While dining in the dark, everyone is blind. Here, blind people are the experts – they know more about living without sight than anyone!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "These restaurants give blind people jobs. They give people who can see a new way of thinking. But most of all, they give blind people something they do not get enough of – respect. People who can see learn more about the experience of being blind. Jorge Spielmann talked to writer Jacqueline Harmon Butler about this goal. He said,",

Helen did not react to noise. She did not react to movement either. When Helen’s mother placed her hand in front of Helen’s eyes, Helen did not move. She could not see. She could not hear. The sickness had left Helen blind and deaf.",

She was intelligent but she had no way to communicate. By the time she was six years old, Helen’s family needed a new way to help her. They travelled to an institute for the blind. Doctors there said that Helen would never see or hear again. But the director of the institute told them not to lose hope. He said that Helen could learn. She only needed a teacher.",

                    "After this, Helen wanted to know more and more. Anne continued to teach her words and their meanings. Soon Anne taught Helen to read and write. Helen did this through her sense of touch. People were very surprised that Helen could read, write and communicate! This was not common for blind people in the 1800s. But Helen did not ever give up.

                    "Voice 1",
                    "The last kind of move is a ‘freeze.’ This is when the dancer suddenly stops moving in a surprising position. She stays very still when the music changes or stops.

These fighting sports include karate, kung fu, and taekwondo. Breakers add kicks and punches to the dance. They move in short, quick motions. Their clothes also show an influence from martial arts. These dancers may wear traditional breaking clothes and martial arts clothes together. They may wear white pants. Or they may wear a colored piece of cloth around their heads.",

                    "It is a warm day in Jakarta, Indonesia. A young woman sits in her car. The traffic is busy.  None of the cars are able to move. The woman looks at the empty driving lane next to her. This space is a special part of the road. It is only for buses and emergency vehicles. As she watches, a car drives past. This car is driving in the special lane. She recognizes the car.  It is the car of a government official named Salim Segaf Aljufri! She holds up her telephone.  She takes a picture. She puts the picture on the Internet using Twitter. Many people see the picture on this social media website. The very next day, the police appear at Aljufri’s office. And they give him a fine for breaking traffic laws!",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Indonesia is a large country in Southeast Asia. Over 240 million people live there. For the last 20 years, Indonesia has worked to become a fully democratic state.  Much of that work has been successful. However, many Indonesians still identify problems with their country. Some citizens complain about poor government. Others worry about the country’s lack of security. And still others describe the country’s poor economic situation.",

                    "Many Indonesians work hard to change these negative issues. Some citizens protest to show their opposition. Others join political movements or work with social organizations to encourage social change. But most recently, Indonesians have been working for change in a new way – by using social media.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Indonesians are major users of social media. They enjoy using these Internet websites to connect with other people. Nearly 17% of Indonesians uses social media websites every day. The most popular social media websites are Twitter and Facebook. And Indonesia has the second highest number of Facebook users in all of Asia.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "This high use of social media has begun to influence how Indonesians encourage change.  More and more people are using social media to share their opinions about social and political issues. Social media helps many Indonesians become involved. It helps them feel like they have power to influence their government. And news spreads more quickly. If a politician says or does something wrong, people can discuss it on social media. And this can change public opinion.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "In October of 2012, social media influenced the actions of the Indonesian President. In the Indonesian government, there is a group called the Corruption Eradication Commission or KPK. The KPK works to find corrupt or dishonest officials. Corrupt officials often accept money or bribes to do illegal things for people. The KPK works to find corruption and punish the people responsible.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "In 2012, the KPK was investigating one of the country’s top police officials. The police were not happy with the KPK’s investigation. The police were using their power to block the KPK’s work. This action made many Indonesians angry. They believed the KPK should be able to work freely. So they talked about it on social media.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "On Facebook, people started a “Save KPK” movement. And on Twitter, “Save KPK” became a very popular conversation subject. People criticized the President for being quiet on the issue. The “Save KPK” movement became so popular that news organizations were talking about it!  Soon, the President ordered the police to stop interfering with the KPK investigation. And he said that Indonesians on social media made it clear that he needed to act!",

                    "Social media has also been important for Indonesians who are fighting for their rights. In 2008, Prita Mulyasari had a terrible experience at the hospital. Her doctors treated her poorly. They told her wrong information about her condition. And they ordered tests that were not needed. She was very angry about her experience. When she got home, she wrote an email about it to friends and family.",

                    "Some of Mulyasari’s friends sent the email to other people. Soon, it spread all over the Internet. A news organization even reported on it! And Mulyasari’s doctors saw the report. They were angry, too. They did not think Mulyasari should have written negative things about them. So they took her to court. They wanted her to pay money and to go to prison.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many people in Indonesia believed the doctors were wrong. But, they also thought the doctors would probably win.  They believed this because the doctors had money to pay for a good legal expert. And Mulyasari did not. So, a group of people started a movement on Facebook. The movement raised money to help Mulyasari pay for her court case. Without the power of the Internet, Mulyasari probably would have lost her case.  But in 2012, court officials ruled that Mulyasari was innocent. It was because of social media that Mulyasari did not go to prison for expressing her opinion.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Social media is a way for people to easily and quickly share their ideas and experiences. Sometimes, this can create action and influence real change. However, it does not always lead to permanent change. In Mulyasari’s case, politicians became involved. Her simple email became a national discussion about health care and the courts. But, court officials did not change any laws. Arjuna Dibley is a writer for the magazine Inside Indonesia. She wrote about the Mulyasari case. She talked about why there was no change in the law. She said:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Today, social media action in Indonesia is concentrated on short messages and quick reaction to new cases. Social media lacks the long term, deep power required to create legal changes. Mulyasari’s case shows that once the early popularity of a particular case is gone, the discussion ‘moves on’ to new issues.  But the difficult, complex and longer term goal of creating legal change remains unanswered.”",

Very shortly, the MEP put a smoke filter in the restaurant. After that, the smoke problem was solved. Chai said,",

                    "Voice 1",
                    "Experts say that heat causes the most damage when outside temperatures stay high day to night. The middle of the day is usually the hottest. And then at night the temperature is cooler. A healthy person’s body can adapt, or change, during the day so that hot weather is not as dangerous to his body. Then, at night when the temperature is cool, his body can rest from the heat. But, if the temperature does not cool down at night, this causes serious problems for his body.

If he does not put enough water back into his body, he could become dehydrated. Dehydration is one of the most common problems in hot weather or a heat wave. Someone who is dehydrated may have trouble thinking or working. This is because lack of water affects the working of the brain.",

                    "Heat cramps are quick painful muscle movements that a person cannot control. A person can get heat cramps when she is in very hot weather and has not had enough water. They are most common when a person has also been doing a lot of physical activity. If a person has heat cramps, you should move her to a cool place. Then give her plenty of liquids. A sports drink is a good choice. But coconut water, milk, or water are also very good in this situation.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Heat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. A person with heat exhaustion may have cool wet skin. He may sweat a lot and feel dizzy or faint. He may feel as if he will be sick or have a headache. His heart will beat quickly, but weakly. He may even fall to the ground. If it is not treated, it can be very serious.",

                    "The Jian Mu tower is a kind of vertical farm. It is not the first vertical farm. Vertical farming is already happening in some countries. The country with the most vertical farms is the United States. But there are vertical farms in many countries, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UAE. Many of them grow leafy green vegetables like lettuce and kale. Economic experts consider vertical farming a growing market. But the Jian Mu is one of the biggest planned projects.",

Traditional farms need soil to help plants grow. But vertical farms use methods like hydroponics. These methods give water and nutrients to the plants directly. They do not need soil.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Vertical farming also lets farmers put plants anywhere. In a vertical farm, farmers hang plants above and beside each other on a wall. Sometimes, they use special lights to help the plants grow. Others, like the Jian Mu tower, hang plants by windows. The tower is so high, the plants get plenty of sun. Doing this also has another benefit: When plants take in sunlight, they also take in heat. This helps control the climate in the tower. So, the tower will use less energy.",

                    "Vertical farms can be very efficient. Traditional farms can only grow food at some times of the year. But vertical farms can grow plants all year. Some vertical farms trap rainwater. They can recycle the water they use. So droughts – or reduced rain – do not affect the farms. The Jian Mu tower will even get moisture from the air. But vertical farms are a very good use of space. They use far less land than a traditional farm. Brian Moeljadi is the manager of a vertical farm. He told Spectrum News:",

And you look around for the land where that food will come from, and you do not find it. It is not there. So, the biggest problem facing the global population is: Where will the food for the next three billion people come from? So, it could come from someplace other than a traditional farm. The question is, could vertical farms solve that problem?”",

                    "Efficient use of space is important for another reason. It helps fight climate change. According to the World Health Organization, over 50 percent of the world lives in cities. But most of our food does not come from cities. It comes from the country. This means that people living in cities must ship food into the city. The food must come from even farther if it is not in season. Some fruits, like avocados, can travel for thousands of miles before people buy them. This uses a lot of fuel. Food producers must also use preservatives to keep the food fresh. This damages the environment. It also adds to climate change.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Vertical farming might help reduce these problems. A traditional farm cannot fit in a city. But a vertical farm can! The Jian Mu tower shows that even if you live in the city, there can be a farm in your home. Much of the food people eat in the tower will come from the tower itself. They will not have to go anywhere to get it. They will not have to ship as much food in. And the food will be grown without pesticides or preservatives.

In 2011 there was a big earthquake. The earthquake caused a tsunami. This huge wave hit Japan and caused terrible damage. The power plants in Fukushima melted down. This contaminated the area with radiation. People could not go there without getting very sick. People in Japan were very scared of the radiation. They did not want to eat food grown anywhere near Fukushima. So, the government funded vertical farming. These new farms were safer than traditional ones. They allowed people to have fresh food, without fear of radiation.",

                    "One of the biggest dangers of the cold is called hypothermia. A person gets hypothermia when their body temperature gets too low. The human body naturally regulates its own temperature. When it is too hot, we sweat. When it is too cold, our bodies try to make heat. When a person is in the cold, it is almost like they are exercising. Their body is working extra hard to keep the temperature at the right level.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But sometimes, the body cannot create heat fast enough. Or, it has no more energy to use. When this happens, the body’s temperature begins to drop. Soon after, the brain stops working correctly. This is one of the first signs of hypothermia. A person with hypothermia may have a difficult time remembering things. They may be confused, tired, or have a difficult time moving. This makes it even more difficult to get help.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Hypothermia usually happens when a person is out in the cold for too long or they are not wearing enough clothing. Without proper clothing, the body will lose heat even more quickly. Strong wind can also lead to hypothermia. If it is very windy, the air will carry off heat from the body faster. This is why windy weather feels colder than it actually is. It causes us to lose more heat.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "When a person has hypothermia, it is important to help them as soon as possible. Here is how you can do that. Bring them inside into a warm room. If they are awake, make them a warm drink. Try to warm the center of their body first: the chest, neck, head, and groin. Keep the person dry. If they have wet clothes, remove them. When a person is wet, their body will lose heat faster. Keep them wrapped in dry blankets. And most importantly, get them emergency help.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Being in the extreme cold can also lead to frostbite. Frostbite is an injury where part of a person’s body freezes. When this happens, the water in their body turns into ice crystals. These crystals damage the body parts. And they make it impossible for blood to flow. Frostbite usually affects the body’s smaller parts like toes, fingers, cheeks, nose, and ears. A person who has frostbite will not be able to feel the affected area. The skin will get hard and change color. In extreme cases, frostbite can damage organs and skin.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "If you have never been in the cold, it can be difficult to understand the unique pain of frostbite. It is like being burned. But you are being burned by the cold. With very bad cases of frostbite, a person might not even feel it. Sir Ranulph Fiennes is a famous explorer who once had a bad case of frostbite. He was exploring in the artic when his supplies fell in the water. He had to reach in to pull them out. He told the magazine Esquire what happened next:",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“The water was not all that cold. It was probably about 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But when I got my arm out of the water, it started getting cold very quickly. My fingers felt like dead wood. I could not bend them.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Sir Fiennes had fourth-degree frostbite in his fingers. There are four different types, or degrees, of frostbite. A person with a fourth-degree frostbite may never feel the affected area again. The area may die. In the most extreme cases, it may even fall off. In Sir Fiennes’ case, he lost most of his fingers. He was very lucky to not lose his hand.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "If someone has frostbite, it is very important to get them to a warm place. Place the affected area in warm water. Keep the area protected. Do not touch the area with frostbite. Moving or rubbing the area can cause more damage. When the area has warmed again, give the person pain medication. When blood returns to a frostbitten area, it can be very painful. You should also get them emergency care. Doctors may be able to save an area from dying.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many people may not recognize symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite. But it is important to know how to prevent them. Here are some suggestions on how to stay safe in cold weather:",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Wear layers of clothing and cover all areas of skin. Wearing the proper clothing is very important in cold weather. It will keep the heat of your body close to your body. And clothing will protect you from the wind. It is very important to cover your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. These areas keep the least heat. They are very vulnerable to frostbite.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Keep yourself dry. If you are sweating in cold weather, you may be wearing too much. Take off a layer of clothing. You will still be protected, but you will not be wet.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Avoid drinking alcohol when you are in the cold for a long time. Alcohol opens up a person’s blood vessels. Blood will rush away from the important parts of a person’s body. Blood carries heat. So, a person will lose heat in the important areas of the body.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Know your body. Some people may suffer more from the cold. These include older people, and people with bad circulation. These people should avoid being out in the cold for too long.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Finally, keep active. The body warms in the cold naturally. Staying active will help keep the body warm.",

                    "South Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.",

Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.",

                    "In Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.",

                    "In 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.",

It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job.

Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles.

And many canals run between these buildings. The Rhine River flows through the center of the city. The city is beautiful. It is like nowhere else in the world.",

But Rotterdam also has a problem: it is sinking. In fact, much of the Netherlands is sinking. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on this sinking country.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The Netherlands has a long history of working with water. Over one third of the country is below sea level. In 800 B.C., much of the land was not land at all. It was under water! But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Over the years, the Dutch have developed many ways of keeping water out of the land. They built huge walls across lakes and the sea coast. These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Working with water is very important to the Netherland’s success. It helped the country to grow. It is still a very small country. But today it is the seventeenth largest economy in the world!",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But removing water often has a downside. Much of the Netherlands is built on peat, a special kind of thick decaying plant material. Usually, peat rests on top of water. When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "For the people of Rotterdam, this is a very big problem. Many buildings there are very old. Some were built hundreds of years ago. They do not have good foundations. When the ground subsides, those foundations can break. If people do not do something, the buildings may fall over.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "But there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the people of the Netherlands are not giving up. Instead, they are making plans for the future. Some believe that the old methods will still work. The Dutch could continue to build dikes and pump water. But as sea levels rise, the cost of this method will go up as well.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Instead, the Dutch are doing something different. They are not completely keeping the water out. They are letting some in. They call this the “Room for the River” program. In this program, the Dutch ask people to leave some low areas near rivers. Or, they repurpose public places. If there is a flood, these areas will fill first. They will keep water out of larger cities and towns. Hans Docter is a Dutch ambassador. He spoke to Haaretz news service about the effort.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "In some places, these changes have already begun. Stan Fleerakkers is a farmer from the Netherlands. The government bought his farm as part of the room for the river project. But Fleerakkers did not want to move. So, the government built a large terp in the area. Fleerakkers moved his farm onto the terp. Now, when the area floods, there is water in his old farmland. But he is living high above it.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Many more people may soon live like Fleerakkers. The Dutch may build the land up instead of keeping the water out. Or, they may make their homes with new building standards. Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood. But the flood will not harm anyone. In Rotterdam, buildings are already made to hold or be above water.",
                    "Voice 2",

                    "Voice 1",

Cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and New Orleans are already dealing with the problem. No country can solve climate change by themselves. Everyone must work together to handle the issue. But many countries may look to the Netherlands as an example. They have a long history of dealing with water. That history may be just what the future needs.",

                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many people around the world love meat. People eat pigs, chicken, cows, goats, and many other animals. Meat is an important part of the world’s diet. For some, meals with meat are important to who they are. Many regional foods depend on meat for their uniqueness.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But there is also a big problem with meat. Raising animals takes up a lot of space, food, and water. And the global population is increasing. As more people come to live on the earth, they will demand more meat. But the earth may not have enough space to keep these animals.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Raising livestock animals also has a serious effect on climate change. Some animals, like cows, goats, and sheep, have special stomachs. These stomachs allow them to eat foods that are very hard to digest, like grasses and leaves. But digesting these foods produces a lot of methane gas. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. It traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide. And the global meat industry is responsible for 30 percent of the world’s methane production! If the world continues to produce meat like this, it could be very bad for the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "For some people, growing meat in laboratories may be the solution to this problem. Meat grown with this method is usually called cultured meat, lab-grown meat, or in vitro meat. To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“Cultured meat could address all the problems related to industrial meat production. It addresses environmental impacts and concerns about treating animals well. It stops the risks of getting diseases from animals. It can do all this while making sure there is a production system to meet the growth in demand for animal protein.”",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "For people like Specht, in vitro meat could solve many of our problems. But the technology for in vitro meat is still very new. And it is still very expensive. Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce. But a meal of this chicken will cost about 17 dollars.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The process also may not be as environmentally friendly as people thought. Growing in vitro meat uses a lot of energy. Some of this energy will come from burning fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. And it lasts in the atmosphere longer than methane. So, many people say it is worse for the planet in the long-term.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Growing in vitro meat may also cause a lot of waste. This is because cell cultures must be sterile. They must be free of any bacteria. Otherwise, other things will grow, and ruin the meat. These sterile containers also create a lot of plastic waste. And there is already a problem of too much plastic waste in the environment.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the biggest question about in vitro meat might be: will people eat it? Many people do not trust food grown in a lab. In vitro meat may seem unnatural. Or people might fear that it will somehow affect their bodies in a bad way. And in vitro meat also does not taste like meat from animals. It does not have fat, only muscle. Fat must be added later, and the taste is still not quite the same.",

The sea crashes below. And, out above the sea, the sun begins to set. The woman parks her car and looks out over the ocean. The engine of her electric-powered car is quiet. Its sound disappears into the wind.",

                    "Cars are everywhere. They take people to remote places. They take people to work and to their homes. Usually, these automobiles are powered by gasoline or petrol. But things were not always this way, and they may not always be either.",
                    "Today’s Spotlight is on the history and future of the automobile.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "People have dreamed about creating cars for a very long time. They wanted a way to transport people and goods without animals. But it took a very long time to make one that worked.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Nicholas Cugnot was a French inventor. He built the first car in the late 1700’s. It used steam to power its engines. And it could drive at speeds of about 7 kilometres per hour. But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use. But cars did not become popular until someone invented a different kind of engine.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "The engine that powers many of the cars you see on the road today is called an internal combustion engine. Many people helped to create the internal combustion engine. But the first person to use it in a car was Karl Benz, in 1885. Internal combustion engines are smaller than steam engines. They use gasoline to fuel the engine. And they can produce more power to push a car faster.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "This new engine made cars more popular around the world. But for a long time, only the very wealthy could buy them. Cars cost a lot of money because of the way people made them. One or two people made each car by hand. So cars took a long time to make. Also, each car was different so they cost a lot of money to fix.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But in the early 1900s a man from the United States changed how cars were made. His name was Henry Ford.  Ford was a car engineer. At first, he made cars the traditional way. But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Ford’s method changed the way industry works around the world. He designed a system that made it easy to produce large amounts of his product. He paid his workers enough money so that they could buy his product. Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars. Many other car companies also used Ford’s methods. Cars began to cost less money all over the world.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "But the number of cars on the road also created a problem. Every car needed gasoline for fuel. Burning gasoline worked very well to power cars. But it also creates a lot of  pollution. The number of cars made some cities difficult to live in. People exposed to too much vehicle pollution develop problems with their breathing.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Burning gasoline also creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that leads to global climate change. Using gasoline was a great idea when people started making cars. There were not many cars in the beginning, so the pollution did not affect much. But today there are more than one and a half billion cars on the road. The success of the car has turned gasoline use into a danger.",

                    "Kate Brunton is a representative from Amber. Amber is a Dutch car company that makes electric, self-driving vehicles. She spoke to the University Network about the problem of gasoline cars.",
                    "Voice 3",
                    "“The problem is that owning cars, especially cars that use fuel, is bad. But there is no real choice. It is bad for consumers, because the cost of owning most cars is high. It is bad for the environment. It does not work well. Most cars spend 90 percent of their time standing still.”",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Today many car companies are working to make cars that do not need gasoline. For example, many large vehicle manufacturers have begun to produce electric vehicles. Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "Another newer creation is the hybrid vehicle. Hybrid cars use technology from both gasoline and electric engines. Hybrids have gasoline engines like normal cars. But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines. And they require less gasoline to operate.",
                    "Voice2",
                    "Other companies have been experimenting with different fuels. For example, it is possible to fuel a car with hydrogen. Many large car companies are researching this new technology. Right now, it is difficult to use hydrogen because it does not last very long. One tank full of hydrogen may only be able to fuel a car for a very short time. But people are hopeful that new technologies will help make hydrogen work in the future.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are many possible paths for the future of the car. How we travel has changed many times over the past hundred years. And it will change again. It may be possible that there will be no single replacement for the internal combustion engine. In the future, there may be many different kinds of cars, each with different fuels. Or people may use cars less.  Either way, it is important to continue to invest in these new technologies. It is important not only for the future of the car, but for the future of humanity.",

For example, in China, some people cook insects over a fire. They put the insects on a stick. The cooked insects are served on the street as street food. They are also served in restaurants, where food costs a lot of money. In the country of Ghana, people collect the termite insect in the spring time.

Many people in North America and Europe eat a lot of livestock meat like cow and pigs. But they do not traditionally eat insects. They do eat some products of insects, like sweet honey from bees. But it is not normal to eat a whole insect in any form. In fact, for many people in the west, eating insects sounds insane! They believe insects are dirty and dangerous. Insects make people feel uncomfortable.",

                    "The first tip for pregnant mothers is to eat good foods. A baby still living inside a mother’s body is called a fetus. The fetus gets all it needs from what a mother eats. For a baby to be healthy, it needs healthy foods as a fetus. Pregnant women should eat vegetables and fruits. They should eat whole grains like oats and rice. Protein is also important. It is found in foods like eggs, beans, nuts, and meats. It is also good to eat some cheese or yogurt.",

These foods can contain harmful bacteria. This bacteria can cause the woman to lose important nutrients in her body. It can even cause the woman’s body to reject the fetus. Some experts also say that pregnant women should limit their caffeine. This is the drug found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks.

Woman can suffer from back pain and difficulty breathing. But sleep can help everyone. When people sleep enough, they reduce stress, build muscle, repair body tissues, and process things they have learned that day.",

A woman can use pillows or other soft things to get into a comfortable position. If possible, a woman’s partner should encourage her to sleep longer. He could take on a few more morning duties for her. Or he could encourage her to sleep during the day.",

Exercise is good for most people. This is true for pregnant woman as well. It is important that women talk to their doctor before beginning any exercise program. Staying physically strong during the pregnancy can also help with the birth and recovery.",

                    "The final tip for a healthy pregnancy is to think about a plan for the birth of the baby. Labor is usually painful and can be frightening. Thinking about what the birth might be like can give a woman some control over what is happening. She can make a plan for how she would like things to go or about who she would like to be there.",

                    "The first way to have a healthy childhood is to take care of the physical body. If a child lives in a dangerous situation, they cannot have a healthy life. Parents cannot stop all hurt and harm. Children often get hurt playing hard or falling down. This is one of the ways children learn about what is safe and what is not. But parents should work to keep children as safe as possible. Parents need to be careful around water, especially with young children. Other concerns are fire, guns, and knives. Children like to explore. But they should not explore things that could lead to injury or death.",

To strengthen bones, young children should hop, skip, jump, and roll around. A target may be three hours each day. This can be all kinds of exercises: light, moderate, or fast. Children ages six through 17 years can achieve most health benefits by doing moderate and fast physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes or more each day.”",

And if adults around them smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol, children may do that. If adults spend hours looking at a phone, then children will want to do that too. Parents need to teach with their words. But they also need to show children with their actions.",

Any time you spend around your children can be a chance for connection. It does not have to be complex. With a baby, it could be as simple as 30 seconds of play or touching her toes. With older kids, it can just be taking time to stop and look at something your child is interested in. You can comment on it and see the world through her eyes. It could be playing a game — even a video game. Or it could be having a teenager show you what he is posting on Instagram. The important thing is to get on their level, be in their world.”",

When you are injured, white blood cells go to the injury to stop things getting worse. Other blood cells remove dead cells and help to control inflammation. If you break a bone, bone cells build the rough edges back together. There are so many cells assisting us in healing that we could never count them all. These processes happen on their own.

Your body’s healing processes require sleep to work. For example, your body produces the chemical melatonin when you sleep. This chemical increases your immune system and helps repair your body. It may even help prevent some forms of cancer. But if you are not sleeping enough at night, your melatonin levels can be reduced.”",

It is a general loss of skills such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. A person with dementia cannot do normal things on their own. This can happen for several medical reasons.

First, as people grow older their bodies begin to contain less water. Second, the kidneys stop working as well. These organs clean the body’s water. And third, research shows that older people do not feel thirsty as soon as younger people.",

It can also reduce stress. But as people grow old, they may not be able to walk as well. People can struggle to get outside, especially if there is snow or ice. Older people can sometimes spend weeks or months without going outside. But research shows that even 30 minutes outside can make a big difference to a person’s health and attitude.",

                    "The third tip to living a healthy life as you get older is to think about the past in a healthy way. The average length of life is different depending on where in the world you live. But all aging people understand that they have less time left to live. This can make them ask a lot of questions. Erik Erikson was a famous psychologist. He developed a series of steps of human life. Kendra Cherry wrote about Erikson’s work for the website VeryWellMind.com. She writes:",
                    "Voice 4",
                    "“Success at this older time of life means that people are able to look back at their life with a sense of happiness. They can face the end of life with a sense of wisdom and no regrets. Erikson defined this wisdom as an “informed and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself.” Those who feel proud of their achievements will feel a sense of wholeness. These individuals will get wisdom, even when looking at death. Those who are not successful during this time of life will feel that their life has been wasted. They will experience many regrets. This person will be left with feelings of bitterness and no hope.”",

                    "The fourth tip to living a healthy life in old age is to give to your community. A person can give money. But adding to your community is so much more than money. Throughout life, a person learns a lot of different skills. Some skills are learned at work. But some skills are learned through hobbies or other life experiences. A person can use the skills he has learned to improve the community around him. A person can discover meaning and purpose to life when they find a way to add to their community. It is also a good way to help those people that they care about.",

But they are not always living better. She thinks one solution is to stay connected to the world through learning. This could be reading about something you do not know much about. It could be trying a new food – or even meeting a new person. Andersen writes:",

The least interesting older people I know are those who find a comfortable place and stop. They do the same things. They have the same conversations. They express the same opinions. Choose to learn something totally new every week or every month. There is nothing like being bad at something to wake you up and shake you out of your understanding. And when you start to get good at it, it can make you feel as excited as a six-year-old.”",

In the Christian Bible, Jesus tells his followers to sell their things and give to the poor. Nicholas could not forget these words. He gave away lots of his money to the poor. And he helped people who were sick or suffering. There are many stories about his secret giving. It is not clear if these stories are true. But they show how much he cared for poor people.

He thought if he did this he would be able to care for his other daughters.",

The daughter had washed her stockings and hung them by the fire to dry. Nicholas threw a small bag of gold into one of the stockings. Then he left. In the morning, the man discovered the gold. Now he did not need to sell his daughter. Instead he was able to find a husband for his daughter. In a year, it was time for his next daughter to be married. But the man was still poor.

Years after he died, people wanted to honor him for devoting his life to God and caring for people. So they named him a saint.",

                    "Many countries have created stories about Saint Nicholas as a secret gift-giver. Often the stories are for children. Saint Nicholas considers how children have behaved all year. Then, he gives them good gifts for good behaviour and bad gifts for bad behaviour. These stories explain Christmas traditions. For example, in many European countries, children leave their shoes out for Saint Nicholas. They hope he will fill their shoes with treats.",

Because of his goodness, many religious people travelled to the place he was buried. But during the 11th century, there was war in the area of Myra. A group of sailors used the war as a chance to steal the bones of Saint Nicholas. They brought them to Bari, Italy. That is where Saint Nicholas is buried today.",

Christians believe that Jesus was a gift to the world. They believe he was both God and human. And because Jesus lived as a human, he knows what it is like to have pain and hurt, joys and happiness. Christians believe that in Jesus’ birth, God comes to earth. God brought the gift of hope to a broken world.",

And he did many miracles. Jesus was not just any man. Jesus was God’s son. He was born on earth to save people from their sins – all the wrong things they do. This is the miracle Christians celebrate at Christmas. Jesus, God’s son, came down to earth as a weak and helpless baby. But, just as the angels said, he would sacrifice himself for all people, around the world. That is the true meaning of the Christmas story.",

So he and the woman began to pass notes to each other through the prison bars. They fell in love with each other. When it was time for the prison to execute the man, he sent her one last letter.

                    "“As a child, I experienced all the local customs around Easter and helped prepare fanesca. Usually, the children had the job of peeling all the fresh beans and grains. I try to do the same with my children now. I want to make sure that they understand the real meaning of this holiday. I want them to learn about the customs that I grew up with in Ecuador. I have found that food is a great way to teach children about traditions and customs, especially if you involve them in the preparation of the food.”",

But for some people it is also part of the spiritual preparations for the Easter holiday. For the 40 days before Easter, some Ecuadorians do not eat any meat except fish. They do this to remember the suffering of Jesus. So fanesca is made with fish as a part of the fast before Easter.",

                    "Some people also say that the fish has a symbolic meaning – it is an ancient symbol for Christ. The fish stands for the name ‘Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Saviour.’ Many people think that the grains and beans are also symbolic. Some people add exactly 12 different grains to their fanesca. Some Christians believe that these twelve grains represent the twelve disciples, or followers, of Jesus.",

They had a very difficult time during their first year there and many of them died. The next year they finally had a good harvest. They were very thankful and they wanted to celebrate. They invited their Native American friends to eat with them. Together the two groups prepared and ate a huge meal of corn, fruits, vegetables, fish and meat.",

Fire lights up her sad face. She smiles. This time, she sees the wall become thin. It is almost like paper. She can see through it! Behind it, she sees a room. Such beauty! There is a huge table with hot food on it! She can almost taste the hot food. She reaches out for a little to feed her hungry stomach. But suddenly the fire from the match goes out. Once more, everything disappears. Only the grey wall remains before her.",

Lights shine from its green branches. It is the most beautiful tree she has ever seen! She reaches her hands toward the lights. Then, the match goes out. But the Christmas lights begin to change into stars in the sky. One of the stars falls back to earth.",

The story encourages them to help people in need.",

His name was Isaiah. Isaiah lived in the land of Judah – part of modern day Israel and the West Bank. Judah was ruled by one king after another. Some were good kings, but most were bad.

From this newer part of the Bible, Christians understand that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. We need to remember that Jesus was not born until seven hundred years after Isaiah. Christians believe that God gave these words to describe the birth and power of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not a normal ruler. He did not have a kingdom on earth.

                    "This pudding is part of a Christmas game. The person that makes the pudding hides a whole almond nut in it. They serve the pudding to everyone at the end of the meal. Each person eats their pudding and hopes to find the almond in their bowl. Finding the almond means you will have good luck in the coming year. The person who finds the almond also gets a special present or treat. People all across northern Europe celebrate this fun tradition.",

                    "Germany also has many wonderful Christmas food traditions. However, the sweetest of these is stollen. Stollen is a sweet bread. People have made stollen during the Christmas season for 600 years! In the 1400s, stollen was not very good-tasting. It was made of only flour, oil, water and yeast – for helping the bread rise. However, over many years, the recipe for stollen has changed and developed. Today, the German people make stollen with sugar, colorful dried fruit, nuts, spices, alcohol and a lot of butter.",
                    "People make stollen in the shape of a long bread loaf. Then, they cover it with a sweet, white, sugar icing. The Bible says that after the baby Jesus was born, his parents covered him with white cloth. The stollen’s white icing represents this cloth. And the loaf represents the newborn Jesus.",
                    "During the Christmas season, stollen fills Christmas markets around Germany. And there is a famous stollen festival in the town of Dresden!",

                    "Next, we travel to several European countries to learn about their Christmas Eve meals. In the country of Italy, many people do not eat red meat in the weeks before Christmas. They are waiting for the celebration of Christmas. On the day before Christmas, they eat a special meal that does not include meat. It is called the Feast of the Seven Fishes. In the Bible, the number seven represents perfection or completion. This meal completes the season of preparation for Christmas.",
                    "In Russia and many other Eastern European countries people also celebrate a special meal on Christmas Eve. The meal includes 12 different foods. The 12 dishes are usually fish and vegetables. The number 12 represents Jesus’ twelve disciples and the end of the 12-month year. Many other parts of the meal represent parts of the Christmas story, when Jesus was born. Some people call this Christmas Eve meal the “Holy Supper.”",

                    "Our next Christmas food is popular all over the Spanish- speaking world. It is called rosca de reyes. This means “King’s ring”. From Spain to Mexico to South America, people make, buy, and eat King’s ring. They celebrate the end of the Christmas season, called Epiphany.",
                    "Like stollen, King’s ring is a sweet bread. However, King’s ring is large and round with a hole in the middle. People decorate the ring with colorful, sweet dried fruits and candies. But, the most special thing about the King’s ring is what is INSIDE it.",
                    "Every King’s ring has a small figure hidden in it. It is a symbol of the baby Jesus. Everyone wants to get the piece of the King’s ring with the baby Jesus figure in it. People believe it is a blessing. In some cultures, people bring the figure of Jesus to church with them later in the year. In other cultures, whoever gets the baby Jesus figure must cook the meal at the next holiday! Today, millions of people celebrate the end of the Christmas season with King’s ring.",

A new star appearing meant that a new king was born. A small group of important men lived very far away from Bethlehem. Today, many people call these men the Magi or the Wise Men. The Wise Men saw this star. They wanted to bring gifts to this new baby king. So they travelled to find the baby. They had to travel far. But a star is not a map. It does not give a perfect location.

They stole land, money, animals, objects and even people. When Patrick was 16, people from Ireland raided his family’s home. They took Patrick and held him as a slave. He was kept in Ireland for six years. There, he worked as a shepherd and spent most of his time out in the fields caring for sheep Patrick wrote in his letters that he depended on God when he felt lonely or afraid.",

                    "Historical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.",

He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day.

Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.",

He told the people the temple was for worshipping God – not making money. After this, the religious leaders decided they needed to silence Jesus. He was making trouble for them.",
                    "Over the next few days, Jesus continued teaching about God and performing miracles. But someone was about to betray Jesus. It was one of his own followers, or disciples. The disciple’s name was Judas. One night Judas went to the religious leaders. As he came near, they said:",

He knew he would die and that it would be a painful death. Jesus did not want to experience a painful death. But he knew that his death would save people. Jesus had lived a perfect life.

In an earlier program we told how a large crowd of people cheered joyfully for Jesus as he entered the city of Jerusalem. They were excited because they had heard about Jesus’ great teaching and miracles. Then Jesus ate a special meal with his followers, called disciples. But one of his disciples betrayed him. The disciple told the religious leaders where they could find Jesus. The religious leaders did not like Jesus’ teachings or his popularity. So they brought him to the governor – the area’s Roman leader. The people demanded that the governor sentence Jesus to death. So, he did. This is where part two of our story begins.",

They put small, sharp pieces of metal through his hands and feet. The nails held Jesus in place as soldiers lifted the cross to stand. Jesus’ enemies stood under the cross.

And because of this all people on earth can be forgiven of their sins. You are witnesses to everything that I have done.” [Luke 24:46]Narrator After about a month, Jesus returned to heaven. But before he left, he told his disciples to tell everyone about what had happened. He said:Jesus “All authority in heaven and on earth is mine. So go to the people of all nations. Make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Teach them everything I have told you. I will be with you always until the end of time.” [Matthew 28:18]Voice 1 Since this time, this is what the followers of Jesus do. They spread the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection – the story of how he came to life after death. During Easter, Christians remember this great miracle. Christ Jesus died and rose to life again. He forgave people from their sins. Hallelujah! Praise and thanks to God!The writer of this program was Liz Waid. The producer was Mark Drenth.

Nothing is moving, not even a small brown mouse. The family has hung stockings by the fire. Usually, they wear these stockings on their feet. But tonight, they hope that Saint Nicholas will come and fill their stockings with sweet treats and gifts.

In the Christian Bible, Jesus tells his followers to sell their things and give to the poor. Nicholas could not forget these words. He gave away lots of his money to the poor. And he helped people who were sick or suffering. There are many stories about his secret giving. It is not clear if these stories are true. But they show how much he cared for poor people.

He thought if he did this he would be able to care for his other daughters.",

The daughter had washed her stockings and hung them by the fire to dry. Nicholas threw a small bag of gold into one of the stockings. Then he left. In the morning, the man discovered the gold. Now he did not need to sell his daughter. Instead he was able to find a husband for his daughter. In a year, it was time for his next daughter to be married. But the man was still poor. Once again, Nicholas came during the night. And again, he threw a bag of gold into a stocking.",

This time, the man was ready. He ran out of the house and the person he saw was Nicholas. But Nicholas demanded that the man keep this knowledge a secret.",

He even became a bishop — a religious leader — of the city of Myra. As a bishop, Nicholas continued to serve poor, sick, and suffering people. Years after he died, people wanted to honor him for devoting his life to God and caring for people. So they named him a saint.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "Many countries have created stories about Saint Nicholas as a secret gift-giver. Often the stories are for children. Saint Nicholas considers how children have behaved all year. Then, he gives them good gifts for good behaviour and bad gifts for bad behaviour. These stories explain Christmas traditions. For example, in many European countries, children leave their shoes out for Saint Nicholas. They hope he will fill their shoes with treats.",
                    "Voice 1",
                    "There are also other stories about Saint Nicholas. In Greece, he is not a secret gift-giver. Instead, he is the saint who protects sailors. It is said that in bad weather, sailors would pray to Saint Nicholas. Then he would appear to them like a dream. He would guide them to safety and could make the storms go away.",
                    "Voice 2",
                    "It is not clear exactly when Saint Nicholas died. But many people believe that he died in the year 343 A.D. He was then buried in the city of Myra. Because of his goodness, many religious people travelled to the place he was buried. But during the 11th century, there was war in the area of Myra. A group of sailors used the war as a chance to steal the bones of Saint Nicholas. They brought them to Bari, Italy. That is where Saint Nicholas is buried today.",

In the Netherlands they call him Sinterklaas. In the United States, he is Santa Claus. And in Britain, he is Father Christmas. He has many names, but the idea of the person is the same. He is a gift-giver who brings good cheer at Christmas time.",

                    "But Saint Nicholas believed in a very different kind of Christmas gift. Christians like Saint Nicholas celebrate Christmas as a time to remember Jesus’ birth. Christians believe that Jesus was a gift to the world. They believe he was both God and human. And because Jesus lived as a human, he knows what it is like to have pain and hurt, joys and happiness. Christians believe that in Jesus’ birth, God comes to earth. God brought the gift of hope to a broken world.",

                    "But, Christians know that the Christmas story is only the beginning of a larger story. When Jesus grew up, he was a great teacher. He lived a perfect life. And he did many miracles. Jesus was not just any man. Jesus was God’s son. He was born on earth to save people from their sins – all the wrong things they do. This is the miracle Christians celebrate at Christmas. Jesus, God’s son, came down to earth as a weak and helpless baby. But, just as the angels said, he would sacrifice himself for all people, around the world. That is the true meaning of the Christmas story.",

In Spain many towns create these living nativity scenes. Local people dress up as people from the story of Jesus’ birth. They act different parts of the story. The main nativity scene is always the birth of the baby Jesus.",

But they also created more. They created a whole village. They made a model of the village of Bethlehem from 2000 years ago. They built the ‘Bethelehem’ village on fields near their own village.

The story encourages them to help people in need.",

                    "Unconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God’s love and heaven – especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day — heaven.",

Christmas is the day when Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, but all kinds of people celebrate Christmas as a holiday. In today’s programme, we look back in history to a time before Jesus Christ was born. We think about the people who were waiting for someone to rescue them from their struggles. Their concerns were for the problems that were affecting them at that time. But the Christmas message goes beyond that.

The original words were written in the Hebrew language, more than 2,500 years ago! But they were talking about future events. The man who wrote them was a prophet, a messenger of God. His name was Isaiah. Isaiah lived in the land of Judah – part of modern day Israel and the West Bank. Judah was ruled by one king after another. Some were good kings, but most were bad. When Isaiah wrote his words, Judah was about to be attacked by its enemies. The people were afraid. And so God told Isaiah these words to speak to the people:",

From this newer part of the Bible, Christians understand that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. We need to remember that Jesus was not born until seven hundred years after Isaiah. Christians believe that God gave these words to describe the birth and power of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not a normal ruler. He did not have a kingdom on earth. But Christians believe that Jesus is alive today in heaven. They believe he rules God’s kingdom – and he rules in their hearts.

The Wise Men saw this star. They wanted to bring gifts to this new baby king. So they travelled to find the baby. They had to travel far. But a star is not a map. It does not give a perfect location.

The story of Babushka explains how presents appear while children sleep. Many cultures or countries have different legends that explain the mystery of surprise gifts. There is a story from Italy that is similar to Bubushka. It is called La Befana. Some parts are the same, but other parts are different.",

The most well- known version has become Santa Claus. But the Santa Claus story that is in films today has snow, elf helpers, and flying reindeer. This is a very different from the story of the Wise Men bringing gifts to a baby Jesus.",
