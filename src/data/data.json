It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\n Voice 1\nIt is 1912. The explorer is very cold and tired.  He is in Antarctica.  He has just walked to the South Pole. He is in a thin shelter. A fierce snowstorm is blowing outside. He is unable to reach a safe place. So, he sits and writes in his diary.  He writes about his experiences and concerns. He knows he will soon die.  He is concerned for his family. He writes these final words in his diary,\nVoice 3\n“We are getting weaker, and the end cannot be far. It seems sad, but I do not think I can write more. I pray to God that you will look after our people.”\nVoice 2\nThis explorer and diary writer was Sir Robert Scott. People all over the world write diaries. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was in prison for 27 years. He was later the president of South Africa. He wrote a diary. In South America Che Guevara was a military leader. He also wrote a diary. Every day they each recorded their experiences, hopes and ideas in a diary. Today’s spotlight is on writing a diary.\nVoice 1\nEvery diary is different because every writer is different. Diary writers include actors, writers, explorers, military men, country leaders, children, students, and travelers. People often use diaries as a place to record their private life and thoughts. Creative people often find that writing a diary helps them become even more creative. Michael Palin is an English actor, writer, and traveler. Her told the Guardian News Organization that writing a diary means to him,\nVoice 4\nKeeping a diary means that all that makes a life is not forgotten. All the seeing and hearing, loving and laughing, excitement and upset, joy and sadness, of a life, are remembered. In short, a diary makes time unimportant and offers your life back to you.\nVoice 2\nSome diary writers are famous, but most diary writers and not famous. Instead, they are ordinary people. However, some diary writers are made famous by their diaries.\nVoice 1\nAnne Frank started to write her diary in 1942. She was not famous. She was only a 13-year-old Jewish girl. She lives in the Netherlands. The Netherlands was occupied by Nazi soldiers. The Nazis wanted to kill all jews. So, she and her family hid. They lived in a secret room. Anne thought of her diary like a friend. She even gave it a name, Kitty. Kitty was a private record of her thoughts, dreams, and feelings. Anne did not think that anyone would be interested in her diary. She wrote,\nVoice 5\nWriting in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I’ve never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else would be interested in the thoughts and dreams of a 13-year-old schoolgirl. Oh well, it does not matter. I feel like writing.\nVoice 2\nBut Anne was wrong. She and her diary became famous. She and her family hid for over 2 years. But then enemy soldiers found them. They sent them to a prison camp, and she died there. After the war Anne’s father found her diary. He published it. Many millions of people read Anne’s diary. It was translated into 67 languages. Many people were encouraged by her words of courage and hope. The president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela was one of those people. He read Anne’s diary when he was in prison. He said that it kept his spirits high.\nVoice 1\nMandela found that reading Anne’s diary helped him. But experts say that writing a diary helps a person’s mental and emotional health. It can make a person happier. Research at the University of Iowa showed that writing helps people deal with difficult emotional events. Researchers said it was particularly important to write about emotions. They said it was most helpful for a person to try to understand and make sense of what they think and feel. Scientists at the University of California in Los Angeles also studied this. They discovered that men found it particularly helpful to write about how they felt. And the scientists also found that writing by hand was best.\nVoice 2\nMichael Palin likes writing his diary by hand. He likes making marks on a piece of paper. On his website he talks about writing a diary.  He says,\nVoice 4\n“Handwriting, it sounds old, but it has a lot going for it. Handwriting is a mark of your own individuality. Handwriting is expressive. It shows changes in your mood and your emotions which you will not see if you are typing on a computer.”\nVoice 1\nToday, many medical patients are encouraged to write a diary or journal. Maude Purcell is a psychotherapist. She helps people solve emotional problems. She also says that writing a journal has a positive effect on those that do it. She says it helps people think more clearly about how they feel. It helps people reduce stress and become calmer. It even helps solve problems.\nVoice 2\nAnd a diary is not just good for the writer. It can be a treasure to future generations. The children and grandchildren of a writer can read about a part of their family history. And historians can see diaries of ordinary people doing normal things as important. These private diaries provide valuable historical evidence.\nVoice 1\nBut the diaries of many ordinary people are destroyed when they die. Dr. Irving Finkel of the British Museum was sad about this. So, he started “The Great Diary Project”. This project rescues diaries. It provides a permanent home for thousands of unwanted diaries. The project protects and cares for diaries to help future historians. He told the Independent Newspaper,\nVoice 6\n“All human life is there. And everything is helpfully dated for future historians.”\nVoice 2\nYou may now decide to write a diary. But how do you do it? Experts say that you should try to write something every day. But you should not spend too long doing it. Instead write quickly and do not think too much of what you write. Maude Percel advises how to write a diary on the website, Psych Central,\nVoice 7\nThe most important rule of all is that there are no rules!\nVoice 1\nWhat do you think about writing a diary? Do you already keep a diary? You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net. \nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program Katy Blake. The producer was Michio Ozaki. The voices you heard were from the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nParents do many things that children never see. Parents pay school costs. They buy clothes and food. They pay bills. They fix things when they break. They make rules that protect the children. Children do not always understand all the work it takes to be a parent.\nVoice 1 \nYoung children sometimes dream about what they will do differently when they become parents. They may think they will stay up all night. They will watch movies and eat candy. And when they become parents they will let THEIR children have lots of fun. They will never shout at or punish their children.\nVoice 2\nBut some children must learn very quickly that being a parent is not easy. In terrible situations, both a mother and father cannot care for their children. The reason may be death, illness, or even parents that are present, but too stressed. When this happens, the oldest child can become like the parent to the other children. The older child needs to learn about all the things a parent must do. A child is rarely prepared to do any of them. Today’s Spotlight is on forming a family when siblings — brothers and sisters — must act like parents.\nVoice 1 \nKathy Borkowski was only nineteen [19] years old when her father died. Her mother had died three years earlier. She had a brother who was fourteen [14], a sister who was thirteen [13] and another brother who was ten [10]. Kathy was old enough to live by herself, but her siblings were not. She did have family, but they lived far away. Some of her family were willing to care for one child. But no one could take them all.\nVoice 2\nKathy wanted to keep her siblings together. Her mother had died. Then her father had died. She did not want the rest of her family to be separated. So, she decided to become mother to her own siblings.\nVoice 1 \nKathy had to become more responsible than most nineteen [19] year- old people. She could not go out with her friends on the weekend. She did not have time for a boyfriend. She had to worry about being a good parent. She did not even have much time to think about her own parents’ death. She told NPR:\nVoice 3 \n“Probably one of the most difficult parts is that we had to just keep going. It has taken a long time to understand the death of our parents. It was difficult for my brothers and sisters. They had this loss too. And suddenly, their big sister was in control. And they did not have any other choice.”\nVoice 2\nKathy lives in the United States, but all around the world people take care of their siblings. Death, sickness or even events like earthquakes or flooding can separate families. For Gloria Affia, war separated her family.\nVoice 1 \nGloria Affia was seventeen [17] years old. She lived in Juba, the capital of South Sudan with her brother, age 12, and her sister, age four. Her parents had died. The children were living with their uncle. In twenty sixteen [2016] there was a civil war in South Sudan. Soldiers killed her uncle. Gloria fled with her younger siblings to the country of Uganda.\nVoice 2\nGloria and her siblings settled in a refugee camp. There, she began to understand that now she would have to take care of her siblings. She explained to the Danish Refugee Council,\nVoice 4 \n“When we arrived at the camp, a woman was supposed to take care of us. But she went back to Congo, where she was from. Now, I do not know what will happen next. There is no one other than me to take care of my brothers and sisters. It often feels like too much responsibility, but what can I do? There is no one else.”\nVoice 1 \nGloria is doing the best she can in a difficult situation. She is not able to attend school because she must work. She is learning how to make clothes. But she is proud that her hard work means that her siblings are able to attend school. She is trying to give her siblings a good life, just like a parent would.\nVoice 2\nPeople who raise their own siblings have many challenges. They may need legal control of their siblings to make big decisions. And a sibling in authority is a still a sibling. And siblings often fight! They fight about big things and little things. But just because one sibling has authority, it does not mean that all the siblings are going to listen and obey.\nVoice 1 \nSiblings who act like parents need emotional and physical support. They have lost their parents. But older siblings like Kathy or Gloria do not often have time to stop and cry and be sad. These older siblings need to find food, money, and a safe place to sleep.\nVoice 2\nBut no one raises children on their own. All parents need a support system – people and groups who can help. Help can be government programs, religious communities, families, or friends. Vicki Panaccione is a child psychologist and works at the Better Parenting Institute. She told NPR,\nVoice 5\n“The support system is very important for siblings acting like parents. And some people do not have one. They are alone. They are in this middle place because they are not with people their own age. But they do not fit in with the parents, either. Parents look at them as a child. It is important for that sibling to talk with someone who is in a similar position, or to family members or friends. No one should have to take this work all on their own.”\nVoice 1 \nSiblings that act like parents are dealing with tragedy. But a family formed this way does not have to hold only sadness. They can also hold love. Kathy Borkowski, from the beginning of this program, raised her siblings. Today, she says they are very close. One of her brothers has his own three children. Kathy says they are more than just her nieces. They are more like grandchildren. Families like hers are just one kind of loving family.\nVoice 2\nHave you ever taken care of your brothers and sisters? Do you know someone who has? Tell us about it.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nFriday the 13th. Are you frightened when I say these words? If the words “Friday the 13th” frighten you, you are like millions of other people. They share the same fear. They believe that Friday the 13th is an extremely unlucky and even dangerous day! But is Friday the 13th an unlucky day? Is something bad more likely to happen to a person on Friday the 13th? Today’s Spotlight is on Friday the 13th.\nVoice 2\nMany years ago, humans needed a way to organize time. They made a system of days, weeks, months and years. In Western cultures there are 12 months in a year. And there are about 30 days in each month. Each week has seven days. About two times every year, the 13th day of the month will be a Friday. Some people say that each Friday the 13th is very unlucky. They fear this day.\nVoice 1 \nFear of Friday the 13th is mostly a Western tradition. It is even a part of popular culture. For example, there are some horror films called Friday the 13th. They are very violent and frightening. Many people watch them because they enjoy being frightened. In some of these movies, the violence begins on the day Friday the 13th.\nVoice 2 \nWhere does this fear come from? Experts believe that the fear of Friday the 13th comes from two separate fears that come together. They are the fear of the number 13, and the fear of the day Friday. Many people believe each separate thing is already unlucky. But when you combine them, they are even more unlucky!\nVoice 1 \nThere are many stories about where the fear of Friday the 13th came from. Donald Dossey is a folklore historian. He studies ancient stories from many different cultures. Dossey tells National Geographic Magazine about the beginning of the fear of the number 13. He says the first writing about the fear of the number 13 comes from an ancient Norse story. Adam Navis tells this story:\nVoice 3 \n“The great hero Balder was having a special party. There were 12 people at the party. Then, Loki came to the party. He had not been invited. When he came, there were 13 people. Loki liked to play tricks. He told another person to shoot an arrow at Balder. Balder died and the whole Earth got dark. The whole Earth mourned. It was a bad, unlucky day.”\nVoice 2 \nIn some traditions people refuse to serve a meal to exactly 13 people. They believe it is very bad luck. In France, there used to be people called “fourteeners.” People having a dinner party did not want to have 13 guests. So they would invite one more person to be at the table – a fourteener.\nVoice 1 \nSome people also believe the number 13 is bad because of a story from the Christian Bible. 13 was the number of people at Jesus’ last meal before he died. His follower, Judas, was the 13th person to arrive at the meal. Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus.\nVoice 2 \nThese things made people mistrust the number 13. Many high-rise apartment buildings and hotels do not even have a 13th floor. Most of these buildings go from floor 12 to floor 14. Or they use a different letter or number for the 13th floor. Many airports also do not have a 13th gate. Hospitals and hotels often have no room number 13.\nVoice 1 \nBut this fear of the number 13 is only one half of the fear of Friday the 13th. The other half of fearing Friday the 13th is a fear of the day Friday. The fear of Friday also comes from stories in history. Jesus was killed on a Friday. In the Christian Bible, and in other religious books, there is a story of a great flood that destroyed the earth. Some people say the flood rains started on Friday. Long ago, some people refused to start new projects on a Friday because of these stories.\nVoice 2 \nSailors were especially worried about Fridays. They would often refuse to set sail on a Friday. Rena Dam tells an old story about sailors and Friday the 13th.\nVoice 4 \n“The British Navy wanted to stop sailors’ fear of Friday. They wanted to show them there was nothing to be worried about. So, they planned a new trip. They chose the sailors on a Friday. They launched the ship on a Friday. They named the ship the H.M.S. Friday. They even chose a man named James Friday to lead the trip as the Captain. Then, one Friday morning, the ship set sail for its first trip. It was never seen or heard from again.”\nVoice 1 \nNo one knows if this story is true or not. But it may have made people even more afraid to do important things on a Friday.\nVoice 2 \nEven today, fear of Friday the 13th is common in Western cultures. Some research shows that more people go to the hospital on Friday the 13th. Some people refuse to even go to work. Some people try not to plan an important event like a wedding for Friday the 13th.\nVoice 1 \nDonald Dossey estimates that businesses lose about $800,000,000 each Friday the 13th. People will not fly on an airplane on Friday the 13th. They do not do all the business they would normally do.  Many of these people may not even know the stories about the history of Friday the 13th. They have a superstitious fear of the day. That is, they fear it for no good reason.\nVoice 2 \nSuperstitious fears are common in many cultures around the world. But they can be very unhealthy. They may stop people from living normal lives because they are so afraid. But people do not need to be afraid! Richard Wiseman is a psychologist from the University of Hertfordshire. He has some wise words for people who fear Friday the 13th:\nVoice 5 \n“People need to remember that they can create much of their own good and bad luck. And they should concentrate on being lucky by, for example, looking at the positive events in their lives. They can remember all the good things that have happened. And most of all, they can be prepared to take control of their future.”\nVoice 1 \nIt is true that bad things can happen on Friday the 13th. But bad things can happen every day. And so can good things! Christians believe that the world is ordered by a loving God, not by luck. They know that they do not have to be afraid – not even on Friday the 13th.\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Sara De Koster. The producer was Liz Waid.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThis program may be difficult for some people to hear. This program is about the death of a child.\nVoice 2\nImagine a woman meeting her seven-year-old child. She has not seen the girl in a very long time. So, when they do see each other, the girl asks where her mother has been. She says she has missed her mother. The woman bursts into tears. But the girl does not seem angry. Together, they walk to a playground. The woman, still crying, watches her child play.\nVoice 1\nAfter a time, the girl takes her mother’s hand. Together, they fly up to a place that is a little like heaven. This is where the girl lives now. Together, they eat some of the girl’s favourite foods. Then, the girl is tired. She lies down in her bed. She tells her mother she loves her. “I am not in pain anymore,” she says. Then, she and the bed disappear for the last time. The woman cries and cries.\nVoice 2\nThis woman’s name is Jang Ji-Sung, and she is not really meeting with her daughter. Instead, she is in a virtual reality simulation. Her daughter died of blood cancer. She has been dead for three years. But virtual reality programmers have attempted to re-create what the child looked like. They talked to her parents to understand what she was like. They asked about her favourite things. Then, they made a program that was just like her. They showed it to her mother. It was a program designed to help Jang process her grief.\nVoice 1\nPeople struggle with how to deal with death. Losing someone can feel like losing a part of yourself. And many of us want to have those people back. We may not know how to deal with these feelings. So, we tell stories about them. We look at pictures of them. And we try to get through the pain. But technology is becoming more advanced. And people are wondering if this advanced technology can change the way that we grieve. But are these technologies good? And are they the best way to deal with death? Today’s Spotlight is on how technology can change our ways of grieving.\nVoice 2\nStories about rescuing people from the dead are part of a long tradition of storytelling. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is from ancient Greece. They teach us lessons about seeing our loved ones after they have already died. Megan tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.\nVoice 1\nOrpheus was a famous poet and musician. And Eurydice was his wife. They loved each other very much. Orpheus made music about her so beautiful that it made gods cry. But one day, Eurydice stepped on a poisonous snake. It bit her, and she died. Orpheus was incredibly sad.\nHe was so troubled that he travelled to Hades. In Greek myth, Hades was the land of the dead. He convinced its ruler to free Eurydice. Orpheus could lead Eurydice back to the land of the living. But there was one problem. Orpheus could not look at Eurydice. If he did, Eurydice would remain in Hades.\nBut Orpheus could not help himself. He was almost to the surface. And he glanced around at Eurydice. In that moment, she disappeared. He would never see her again. His grief was greater than when she first died. He had some hope. Now he had none.\nVoice 2\nThis story is a warning about thinking too much about the past. The point of the story is that the dead are dead. Wishing they are not dead will only hurt you. It will stop you from living your life.\nVoice 1\nModern stories show a different way of dealing with grief. They talk about how technology can affect the grieving process. Black Mirror is a British science-fiction television show. Each episode tells a different story. And each deals with our relationship to technology. One episode is called “Be Right Back.” Bruce tells the story from this episode.\nVoice 2\nA woman’s boyfriend dies in a car crash. But she discovers that there is a new technology. This technology can look at her boyfriend’s social media. It can use this information to create an artificial intelligence. It is like her boyfriend. There is even technology to re-create a life-like copy of his body. She uses this technology. But the copy is not quite the same. It does not have her boyfriend’s negative qualities. It will do what she asks without question. She grows to hate the copy. It will never actually be her boyfriend.\nVoice 1\nThis story is also a warning. It warns that technology can never replace humans. And that trying to bring people back will result only in pain.\nVoice 2\nBut are all technologies like this? Nick Stavrou and Steve Koutsouliotas are game designers. In 2015, they started creating a program called Project Elysium. Project Elysium was a virtual reality program. In it, people could visit virtual images of their dead loved ones. They could sit with them. They might even play a game together. These virtual images would not be very realistic. They would not be able to talk. But they would look, and act, in similar ways. They would be like photographs that moved and smiled. Koutsouliotas spoke to Fast Company magazine. He talked about why he thinks Project Elysium could be a good thing. He said,\nVoice 3\n“What if you never had a chance to say goodbye? What if you feel like you are forgetting that person? Sometimes, I panic. I feel like I am forgetting what my father’s face looked like. It is the small things that I fear losing as time goes on. Like sitting next to him. Or, watching him smile when I told him something funny. These are the things that Project Elysium has a better chance at offering.”\nVoice 1\nStavrou and Koutsouliotas believe that technology can help the grieving process. Visiting someone in project Elysium would be just like looking at a picture. Or it could be like going to a memorial.\nVoice 2\nStill, there are concerns about this kind of technology. As it grows more advanced, could it become more like Black Mirror? Technology may one day be able to make a realistic virtual copy of someone. But someone who is living could also become a virtual copy, even if it is something they did not choose. And it could make grief worse.\nVoice 1\nBut grief is different for everyone. For some people, seeing someone they loved in virtual reality will make them feel worse. For others, it may do a lot of good. For Jang Ji-sung, seeing her daughter again was difficult. But it helped her do something she felt she had not been able to do. She could say goodbye. She spoke in a documentary made about her experience. She said,\nVoice 4\n“Maybe it is a real paradise. I met my daughter. She called me with a smile. It was a very short time. But it is a very happy time. I think I have had the dream I have always wanted.”\nVoice 2\nHave you lost a loved one?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nA man is sitting at his desk, typing at his computer. Outside of his window, the sun shines brightly. Birds are singing. It is a very pleasant morning. There is nothing frightening around him. But he is very worried. He is so worried he cannot concentrate. There is a tightness in his chest. There is a feeling of heat on his shoulders. His body is telling him to run. It is signaling to him that, somewhere, there is danger. The man knows there is no danger. But he cannot stop these feelings. He does not even know why he is afraid!\nVoice 2\nThis man is living with an anxiety disorder. These psychological differences in the brain cause people to be afraid of things that do not make sense. Or they cause people to worry too much. But many people have anxieties, even if they do not have a disorder. Today’s Spotlight is on anxiety, and how to live with it.\nVoice 1\nThere are many different kinds of anxiety disorders. Some, people are born with. Other people get anxiety later in their lives. But all people with anxiety have one similarity: an overactive amygdala. The amygdala is a part of the brain. It keeps emotions even and regular. It also tells the body when something dangerous is around. It causes the emotion of fear. In a healthy person, the amygdala does not activate much. But in a person with anxiety, the amygdala is very sensitive. It can activate because of things that do not make sense. Or it can activate for no reason at all. \nVoice 2\nAnxiety disorders can make people’s lives very difficult. An anxiety disorder can cause people to act strangely. This can be very distressing. And it can hurt their lives, socially. One of these disorders is called obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD. A person with OCD has disturbing thoughts. These fears will not go away. But a person with OCD will try to get rid of them. She will perform particular actions to get rid of her anxiety. For example, if she is afraid of getting sick, she might wash her hands. But this does not make the fear leave. So she will wash her hands many times in a row. She will wash until her fears go away. Sam Wicky is a sculptor. He has OCD. In 2020, he talked to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America about his OCD.\nVoice 3\n“My OCD began at age seven. I remember sitting on a chair in front of my family. I opened my mouth wide and inhaled a lot of air. I was looking at my mother. I then held up my hand and blew out the air onto it. I would repeat this action over and over. But no one would say a word. They would watch in confusion. \nAs more time passed, my OCD got worse. I began acting out other strange rituals. It was becoming difficult to get dressed every day. I would count as I put my clothes on. I would have to redo my actions if I started thinking of something bad. I knew something was wrong with me. But I could not talk about it. I then became frightened that my brothers would become like me – that they would also act out strange rituals.\nVoice 1\nAnxiety can also make it difficult to be in society. Some people with anxiety have a hard time doing their jobs or going to school. Kathleen Munro is an employee at Anxiety Canada. She has panic disorder. This condition caused her to have sudden, intense times of panic, or panic attacks. During these panic attacks, fear would overwhelm her. She would not be able to move, because she was shaking so badly. It made her feel like she was going to die. She wrote for Anxiety Canada’s blog:\nVoice 4\n“I could not control it. It left me feeling helpless. I could not commit to anything. I could end up caught in my panic at any time. I missed events with my friends because I did not want to admit I was struggling. I was so tired from pretending to be ok, and to avoid making others uncomfortable. I struggled to feel safe. And this kept me from fully living.”\nVoice 2\nOne of the best things a person with anxiety can do for themselves is to be with other people. Talking to others can help them change the way they think. If someone you know has anxiety, it is important to keep in contact with them. Be available to listen, even if they do not respond. People with anxiety also often suffer from depression. Offering encouragement and support can help distract them from their fears. It can help put them on the way to getting real help. But do not try to solve their anxiety. And do not try to eliminate causes of anxiety. This can actually make the disorder worse. And it could make them depend on you. Joseph McGuire is a doctor at John Hopkins University. He writes,\nVoice 5\n“Trying to get rid of someone’s anxiety seems really thoughtful and sweet. But anxiety does not usually go away. Over time, if people avoid difficult situations, the anxiety grows. And the person begins to ask more and more from you instead of working on their problem.”\nVoice 1\nIf you have anxiety, there are many ways of working through these disorders. There is no single cure. Anxiety disorders do not go away. Instead, these are changes that you can make to your life that may help. Here are some ways of dealing with anxiety:\nVoice 3\nGet regular exercise. Keeping active helps reduce stress, even in people with severe anxiety.\nVoice 4\nAvoid caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. These substances can make anxiety worse.\nVoice 5\nDrink lots of water. Not having enough water can make anxiety more difficult to deal with.\nVoice 3\nSlow down and find time for yourself. Anxiety can often come from living under stressful circumstances. Avoiding those circumstances can help. But sometimes it is enough just to take a break.\nVoice 4\nSeek medical help. While there is no cure for anxiety, there are many treatments that work. Medications called anti-depressants are very effective.\nVoice 5\nTalk to someone or go to therapy. Talking to a professional can help you understand your mind. A therapist can give you methods of working through your anxiety. They can help train you to overcome many of your fears. Anxiety does not have to rule your life. \nVoice 2\nDo you have anxiety? Do you know anyone with anxiety? What do you do to help? You can leave a comment on our website at www.spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are in school. Picture the students sitting in their seats. And think of the teacher, standing at the front of the room. How are you feeling in this moment? Are you excited to learn? Interested? Are you participating in discussion? Or are you bored? Maybe you are falling asleep, watching the clock, or flirting with a classmate? Your thoughts say a lot about you as a student. But they also say a lot about your teacher.\nVoice 2\nBeing a teacher is very important. Teachers can be parents, professors, or even friends. But teaching is also very difficult. Each person learns differently. Some people learn better by seeing. Others learn better by reading. Some learn better by hearing. And still others learn best by doing. Some methods of teaching work best for certain subjects. Teachers must know how to best teach each different student. Have you ever tried to teach someone? Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good teacher.\nVoice 1\nOne of the most important parts of being a good teacher is understanding how people remember things. People naturally remember things that are interesting to them. Interesting facts are easy to memorize. But information that can be used directly in someone’s life is even better. Imagine a history class. It is very difficult to learn the names of famous people who lived long ago. Event dates are difficult to remember. But if you were learning the history of another country where you were going to move, things might be different. It might be very important that you know the information.\nVoice 2\nPeople also learn better when they can connect the subject to something they already know. Imagine teaching someone to repair a car. If they have no experience with machines, it could be very difficult. But if they had worked on engines before, it would be easier. This is true of all subjects, whether it is language, art, or mathematics. We remember things that are useful to us. And if we do not have context, our minds will not recognize information. This is true even if you believe what you are learning is important. It might be very important to repair your car engine. But if you do not know the parts of an engine and what they do, you will not be able to learn. A good teacher will help connect new information to something you already understand. Or they will give you a wider base of knowledge to understand.\nVoice 1\nAnother important part of teaching is learning to understand and care about your students. This means learning who they are. Not all students are the same. And some are going through things you do not know about. Suzanne Tingley is a teacher. She wrote on the blog Hey! Teach:\nVoice 3\n“A friend of mine teaches at a high school where 44 languages are spoken. She told me she heard a student say, “I am really tired. Last night, I slept next to someone who snored.” Kids may be dealing with issues we know nothing about. Do not assume video games are to blame when work is not complete.”\nVoice 2\nA good teacher also knows their subject very well. And they know how students think about it. Teachers must be able to correct students when they are wrong. A good teacher provides constructive criticism often. Constructive criticism corrects student’s mistakes. It gives them ideas for how to improve.\nVoice 1\nMany people do not like to criticize. Criticizing may seem rude. Criticism can lead to shame and bad feelings when it is not planned out. But teachers must learn how to criticize in a way that is helpful. Brooke Chaplan is a writer at The Edvocate. She explains how to criticize correctly.\nVoice 3\n“Constructive criticism is something that should always be shared in private. Begin by telling the student the good things you see about him or her. This will get you started in a good way. Then, tell them what you think is delaying their progress. Then, tell them how they can make a positive change. After, remind them that you believe in them as an individual. If you share your concerns in the right way, it is possible that the student will do what you suggested.”\nVoice 2\nFinally, it is important to let your students be creative. They should not be afraid to ask their own questions. Much teaching in the past treated children as listeners only. Teachers gave students knowledge, and students accepted it. If a student could not learn, teachers decided the student was not intelligent enough. But today, we know that learning works differently. Students learn best when they believe they have the power to ask and explore. Sometimes, it is even good when they get things wrong!\nVoice 1\nImagine a mathematics class. The teacher shows you a problem. And then, she shows you how to solve the problem. You memorize the formula and will use it later on tests. Then, you will forget it. But what if, instead, your teacher asks you how you would solve the problem? You might not know the correct formula. But you can guess and work it out yourself. You think about the problem for several minutes. When you finish, your answer might be incorrect. And your teacher will finally tell you the answer. But while you are working on the problem your attitude changes. The question becomes a puzzle. Now, you want to know the answer to this puzzle. You care about the answer. And you have learned to think on your own.\nVoice 2\nToday, most good teachers know to change their lessons to fit their students. They learn about and care about their students. They know that that learning is not about remembering everything you hear. But more than anything, they know they are not just teaching their subjects. They teach their students how to learn. And they teach them how to think for themselves. People who know how to think and learn will continue to grow. They can change more quickly when required to. And they will live fuller lives.\nVoice 1\nWho was your favorite teacher? Why do you think they were so good? Are you a good teacher?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThink of an event in your life that you remember very well. You can think of any memory, as long as it is clear. Think back. Where were you? Who were you with? What time was it? Can you smell anything? Taste anything? Why do you think you remember this event so well?\nVoice 2\nMemory is strange. Sometimes, a person might remember something that is extremely important to them. At other times, she may remember a fact that does not matter at all. It may be difficult to learn something she wants to remember, like an English vocabulary word! But this does not always have to be the case. There are actually special methods that you can use to improve your memory. Today’s Spotlight is on how to use your memory to remember anything.\nVoice 1\nNo one’s memory is perfect. What a person remembers can be unreliable. Even the most intelligent people forget things. This does not mean a person has a bad memory. It means he is not using his mind to his advantage.\nVoice 2\nThe brain has two kinds of memory. The first is short term, or working, memory. This kind of memory is useful for a very short time. Experts say you can store four sets of information in your short-term memory at the same time. Information in short term memory will last about 20 to 30 seconds or less. Then it disappears.\nVoice 1\nThe second kind of memory is long-term memory. Long-term memory is what people usually think of when they say they have memorized something. Memories in the long-term memory stay. A person can remember them again and again. These are memories like the names of people you know, how to do a task, or memories from a special event from a long time ago.\nVoice 2\nThe trick of remembering is moving information from short-term to long-term memory. No one knows exactly how this happens. But scientists do have theories. Richard Mohs is a writer at howstuffworks.com. He writes that going from one kind of memory to the other is all about attention. You must focus on particular things.\nVoice 3\n“To properly create a memory, you must first be paying attention. You cannot pay attention to everything all the time. So, most of what you see every day is filtered out. Only some information passes into your conscious awareness. How you pay attention to information may be the most important part of how much of it you actually remember.”\nVoice 1\nPeople also remember things that are similar to what they already know. This is because of the structure of the brain. Most of the brain is made of cells called neurons. When we learn something, different neurons connect to each other. When these neurons stay connected, it forms a memory. The more connections a memory has, the stronger it will be. For example, think of a person you know. When you think of that person, the same neurons become active in your brain – every time!\nVoice 2\nMemories can also link to other memories, making them stronger still. This is why memories with multiple senses last longer. For example, a memory where you experienced something by hearing, tasting, and smelling, may be very strong because you used more senses in the experience. These memories connect different parts of the brain. Think of the person you just remembered. Do you remember what their laugh sounds like? Do you remember the sound of their voice?\nVoice 1\nFinally, we make memories when we have repeated experiences. Each time we do the same thing, our brains make new connections. Scientists say our neurons activate, or fire.  Richard Mohs uses practicing music as an example.\nVoice 3\n“If you play a piece of music over and over, certain cells in your brain fire repeatedly in a certain order. This makes it easier to repeat this firing later on. The result: You get better at playing music. You can play it faster, with fewer mistakes. Practice it long enough, and you will play it perfectly.”\nVoice 2\nPracticing, or repeating information, is one of the most popular methods of remembering. If a person has vocabulary cards, they are using this method. But this is not always the best way to memorize. There are many methods which use the other ways we remember – or combine them.\nVoice 1\nAnother memorization method is called a mnemonic device. One well known mnemonic device is called an acronym. Acronyms are helpful in memorizing words. To create an acronym, find a list of words you would like to memorize. It is usually helpful if there is something similar about them. Then, take the first letter from each word. Organize those letters into a word or phrase. You have now made an acronym. Each letter in the final word stands in for another word. So, to memorize many words, you only have to remember one. One famous acronym for learning English conjunctions is FANBOYS. The F stands in for the word “for”. A stands for “and”. The rest stand for nor, but, or, yet, and so. Acronyms work because they make the information simple.\nVoice 2\nAnother memorization method is visualization. In visualization, you think of an image or picture that represents the thing you are trying to remember. For example, imagine a person is trying to remember the name Melanie. He might think of a picture. In the picture, a woman is holding a melon fruit. She is crushing the melon with her knee. The sound of the two images will remind him of the name Melanie. The image is also very strange. It is easier for the mind to remember unusual things. Visualization works because it makes the foreign information into something familiar.\nVoice 1\nOne of the most interesting mnemonic devices is called the method of loci. It is also called a memory palace. To create a memory palace, a person must think of a familiar area, like a house, or a street. Then, she must imagine a journey through that space. In the journey, she stops at different, familiar areas. In each of these areas, she places an item. The item must have something to do with the thing she is trying to remember. Melanie Pinola is a writer and mental athlete. She competes with others to remember long lists of numbers or words. She wrote about the memory palace technique for Lifehacker.com.\nVoice 4\n“For everyday use, the memory palace is helpful for remembering a list of things. Start a journey beginning at a place you know very well, like your home. Begin at your door. If you want to remember a grocery list, imagine the items you need. Imagine a container of milk overflowing on your doorstep. When you get inside, perhaps two giant steaks attack you in your doorway. Continue to your living room to find pretzels dancing on the rug. Again, the more movement, strange experiences, and senses you put into your memory palace, the better for your memorization.”\nVoice 2\nThis may seem like a lot of work, creating more information than the person needs to memorize. But the method of loci is actually a way of “hacking” the brain. To remember something, the brain needs a network of information. Without this network, the memory will fade quickly. The method of loci creates a new network. It uses multiple senses. And then, it attaches the network to something familiar. This way, what you are trying to remember enters the long-term memory.\nVoice 1\nThere are many more mnemonic devices. But most memory methods involve one of these three steps: Make it simple. Visualize it – that is, imagine you can see it in your mind. Connect the information to something you already know. If you can master these simple tips, you will be able to remember huge amounts of information. What will you memorize now?\nVoice 2\nDo you have any special ways you remember things? What are they?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Roger Basick. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nOmar was a first-year university student. He had done very well in his studies before. But now that he was at university, he started having problems. Some of the ideas he was supposed to learn felt too complicated. And he was suddenly in a new environment. He had new friends and new activities to explore. He found it difficult to know when he should study. How much should he study? And what were the best ways to study?\nVoice 2\nDoes this sound familiar to you? Learning can be difficult, in or out of school. Sometimes, we forget too quickly. Or the material can seem too difficult. But there are many different reasons why we do or do not learn a subject. And there are ways of studying that are more effective than others. In today’s Spotlight we will look at some of these methods. Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good student.\nVoice 1\nThe first step to being a good student is having confidence in yourself. Often, students who are having a difficult time believe it is because they are not intelligent.  But this is not true! Learning is how you become intelligent. All of us begin, as children, with no knowledge. From there, we learn and grow. Being a student means continuing this process. It means knowing you may not seem intelligent now, but you will be. Believing that you can learn is the most important step in being a good student. Geoff Nixon is a writer at Gemm Learning. He writes about the importance of confidence.\nVoice 3\n“Confidence is important in learning at any age. When we feel confident, we are more likely to try new things. That will help us improve our abilities. It will help us build on things we already know. Confidence drives resiliency. This is the ability to recover when something has gone wrong and try again.”\nVoice 2\nThe second step of being a good student is understanding what kind of learning you prefer. Take language learning as an example. Some people learn language best by listening. They might learn well by listening to podcasts, audiobooks, or even Spotlight English! But other people learn best by doing. It helps them to apply the knowledge. They might need to speak to others to learn best. Some people are social learners, and study best with others. Others must be alone to learn. Understanding what style of learning you like can help you enjoy studying more. And, when you enjoy studying, you will be better at it.\nVoice 1\nBeing a good student also means taking care of yourself. Our brains work better when our bodies are healthy. This means eating well, drinking lots of water, and taking time for breaks. The Feinberg School of Medicine is a university in the United States. Its students take very difficult tests to become doctors. They study for months and take an eight-hour examination. One successful student spoke to school staff after her test. She shared her secret of success: staying healthy!\nVoice 4\n“I do not care if I am the 1000th person to say it. It is important, so I will say it again: Sleep, eat well and exercise. Honestly, I think that was the most important thing I did. I focused better. And I learned better on days when I was doing those things.”\nVoice 2\nAnother way to learn more effectively is to make a routine. Have special times each week when you study. And study even if you do not feel like it. Studying is not always entertaining. You may not always want to do it. But having a routine will force you to focus.\nVoice 1\nRoutines are also important in reducing stress. And stress can make learning more difficult. If you are stressed, you are not thinking about what you are studying. You are thinking about your stress. Kali Patrick is a psychologist. She wrote on entrepreneur.com about the importance of routine. She said that “when you do not have a plan, life is uncertain. When you have no idea what is going to happen, you can feel worried, anxious, and out of control. Your fear response can turn on. Routines reduce stress naturally. They give some control back to you”.\nVoice 2\nGood students also study over many days. They do not try to study everything all at once. Instead, it is better to repeat the same information several times over a longer period.  Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist. He also studied memory. In 1885, he discovered that people forget at a fixed rate. If we learn a fact once, we lose that information quickly. But, if we learn it again after a short period, it will stay in our memories. The more we repeat it, the more we remember.\nVoice 1\nFinally, good students ask questions. This may seem frightening at first. Asking a question may show that you do not know about a subject. And that can cause shame and embarrassment. But if you do not ask, no one will be able to help. Questions are how we naturally seek answers. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. She studies the science of learning. She wrote that “Asking questions is what our brains were born to do. At least, this is the case when we were children. For young children, quite literally, seeking answers is just as important as seeking food or water.”\nVoice 2\nIf you can keep all of these tips in mind, they may help you be a better student and learner!\nVoice 1\nNow, we have some questions for you.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nDoes your language use any English words? Yes? No? Hello? Languages often borrow words from each other. English speakers use many words that have come from other languages. For example, you may hear an English speaker say something like this:\nVoice 3 \n“I cannot believe I made that faux pas in front of everyone!”\nVoice 1 \nThe words “faux pas” mean a social mistake. They are French. But many English speakers use them.\nVoice 2 \nAnother example is the word “prima donna.” This phrase is Italian. It means “first lady.” English speakers use it to speak about someone who only thinks about themselves.\nVoice 1 \nMany languages also use English words. For example, they use the words computer, internet and email. However, none of these are the most commonly used English word. Do you know what it is? Okay. Yes, the word is okay. Today’s Spotlight is on the word okay.\nVoice 2 \nThe word okay is an informal, spoken word. You will almost never find it in formal speeches, news media, or books. But it is one of the most common English words. It is also one of the most common English exports from the United States! English professor Allan Metcalfe wrote a book about the word okay. He told CBS News,\nVoice 5 \n“There is no other word that is as widely recognized throughout the whole world. No other American English word has had so much success like that.”\nVoice 1 \nIn a general way, okay signals approval, acceptance, or agreement. People can use it in many different ways. Here are some ways to use the word okay.\nVoice 2 \nFirst, okay can be an adjective or an adverb. It can describe an act or a thing. In this way, it means “all right” or “fine.”\nVoice 3 “Are you okay?”\nVoice 2 \nHere is another example:\nVoice 4 “I hope the children are okay while we are gone.”\nVoice 2 \nIt can also mean fine, but not so great.\nVoice 3 “Did you enjoy the dinner last night?”Voice 4 “It was okay.”\nVoice 1 \nOkay can also be an act or a thing – a verb or a noun.\nVoice 3 “Did your boss give you the time off that you asked for?”Voice 4 “Yes, she okayed it.”\nVoice 2 \nOkay is also common as an interjection. It can appear suddenly, on its own. In this way, it can simply mean “yes” or “sure.”\nVoice 3 “Can you please wash those dishes?”Voice 4 “Okay.”\nVoice 1 \nOr it can signal that people need to attend.\nVoice 3 “Okay. Time to begin, please.”\nVoice 2 \nIt can also mean “enough!”\nVoice 4 “OKAY! Please stop now!”\nVoice 2 \nOkay, we are done with this part anyway.\nVoice 1 \nYou have already heard how many different meanings the word okay has. But did you know that the meaning also changes depending on how you say it? The tone of a person’s voice makes a difference. The meaning can change no matter how you use it. For example, the sentence “It was okay” could be positive or negative.\nVoice 3 “How was the show?”Voice 4 “It was okay.”\nVoice 1 \nWhat do you think this person meant? What about this next example?\nVoice 3 “How was the show?”Voice 4 “It was okay!”\nVoice 2 \nThe first answer says that the person was not really satisfied, but he could not think of something bad to say. The second answer says that the person was satisfied. A person’s tone also changes the meaning of the word okay as an interjection.\nVoice 4 “I think we should visit your brother tonight. Okay?”Voice 3 “Okay.”\nVoice 2 \nThe first person used okay to ask for agreement. The second person used okay to express questioning, or doubt. Okay is a small word, but it has many different uses!\nVoice 1 \nSo where did this confusing, complex word come from? People debate the origin of the word okay. The earliest record in print was in 1839 in the city of Boston. At the time, it was popular to use groups of letters to signal words. It was also common to spell the words incorrectly, using the wrong letters, as a joke. A Boston newspaper used the letters “O” and “K” to mean “oll korrect.” The O meant “all”, and the K meant “correct”.\nVoice 2 \nAround the same time, US President Martin Van Buren began to use the word. He was the president, and he was trying to get elected again. His political party used the saying, “Vote for OK.” Van Buren was from a town in New York called Kinderhook. In this case, he used the letters OK to mean “Old Kinderhook.” The saying tried to give the message that Old Kinderhook was “all correct.” Van Buren lost the election. But many language experts think that the election saying helped to make “OK” a common word.\nImage via history-first.com\nVoice 1 \nThis explanation may also explain the unusual spelling of the word okay. People can write okay in two ways. They can write the word using just the letters “O” and “K”. Or they can write it this way: o-k-a-y. And both ways are correct!\nVoice 2 \nOther language experts think the word has a Native American origin. The Choctaw people are one of many Native American groups. The Choctaw language has a word “okeh.” This word means “it is so.” This is almost the same meaning as today’s word “okay.” As early as 1825, Christian Bible translators used “okeh” in their Choctaw Bible translations. In the 20th century, US President Woodrow Wilson used the Choctaw language to sign documents as “okeh.”\nVoice 1 \nOther language experts say that okay came from West Africa. Some West African languages have interjection words that sound similar to okay. For example, the word “waw-kay” in the Bantu and Wolof languages, or “o ke” in the Mande language. These words also commonly signal agreement. West African people were brought to the United States as slaves. The theory is that African slaves used these words when speaking English. After a time, the use spread to the rest of the English-speaking population.\nVoice 2 \nNo one knows which story is true. But today, okay is now one of the most common words in English. People use it all the time, everywhere. Okay is now an international word. But Professor Metcalf believes that it expresses a cultural value of the United States. He told CBS News,\nVoice 5 \n“It is strong, it is simple. People from the United States do not like complex ways of life. And ‘okay’ is about as short and simple as you can get.”\nVoice 1 \nOK. So, after hearing this program, are you okay with Spotlight? Or is it just… okay? Can you give your okay to our programs? Or would you use another word? We are okay if you are okay!

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nMost people have experienced an immediate reaction. Think about the last time you smelled something delicious. Did you react with an emotion? Have you had a reaction to a beautiful piece of art? Did you react emotionally when you saw someone you loved?\nVoice 2 \nMalcolm Gladwell is a writer. He writes about how our brains are influenced by things we do not even know. Gladwell calls these immediate reactions we just thought about snap judgements, or quick decisions. They often influence us in ways we may not even recognize. Today’s Spotlight is on these immediate reactions and how they affect our everyday lives.\nVoice 1 \nHere is a fun example of how our brains create these immediate reactions. Answer these questions as quickly as possible.\nVoice 2  \nWhat color are clouds? What color is snow? What do cows drink?\nWhat does this cow drink?; Image by Wolfgang Claussen from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nMost people answer the first two questions with “white”. But they answer the third question with the word “milk”. If you answered that cows drink milk, you are not alone. The correct answer is water. It was the color white that made you have a snap decision that cows drink milk.\nVoice 2 \nMalcolm Gladwell wrote a book about snap judgements called “Blink”. In this book, he tells a story about a snap decision. In 1983, the J. Paul Getty Museum received a statue. They believed it was from the sixth century B.C. Scientists at the museum did some basic tests to make sure the statue was real. The tests seemed to show that the statue was very old.\nVoice 1 \nThomas Hoving is an art manager. He looked at the statue. Hoving always remembers the first word to come into his mind when he looks at a new piece of work. Normally, when Hoving sees an old, large marble statue, his first word is “old”, “beautiful”, “ancient”, or even “heavy”. Hoving has been around art for many years. His experience makes it easier for him to choose between real art and copies of real art. And when he looked at the statue, the first word he thought of was “fresh”. His snap judgement made him think the statue was not thousands of years old. It was new.\nVoice 2 \nScientists decided to do more tests. These further test results showed that the statue was not real. It was a very good copy of a real statue. The person who made the statue worked hard to make the statue seem old. The museum was not happy when they learned they would not be able to put this statue in their museum. But this snap decision saved the museum from years of shame and regret.\nThe Kouros Statue at the Getty Museum; This photograph has been cropped; Rbw48, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nThis is just one example of the effects of snap judgements or quick decisions. Snap judgements can also help improve – or even save – our lives.\nVoice 2 \nImagine you are walking down a street on a sidewalk. You are thinking about something that is very interesting. You are not thinking about walking down the street. You decide to turn right. You do not see that you have just stepped out on to a busy street. You look up and see that there is a car driving toward you. Without thinking, you jump back up on to the sidewalk. You do this to avoid being hit. It was your own quick decision to jump back, away from the street, that saved you from being hurt.\nVoice 1 \nIn an emergency, quick decisions also help. For example, doctors use snap judgements to treat injuries. They react based on past experiences. These past experiences help doctors know, without thinking, what they must do. If doctors take too long to make a decision, it can be too late to save a person’s life. Their quick thinking can help keep everyone safe.\nVoice 2 \nGladwell says that people make quick decisions because they must. Sometimes people must make quick decisions to survive. Other times, people make them because it is natural. Our past experiences help to form our decisions. This is what helps to make them natural. Snap judgements come from the unconscious part of our brain. So, we do not know we are making snap judgements until after we make them. We often do this when we meet people.\nPhoto by Tima Miroshnichenko from Pexels\nVoice 1 \nThere is a common saying in the English language: “Do not judge a book by its cover”. This means that we should not make an opinion about something or somebody based on the way they look. But people do this every single day. And, sadly, these snap judgements can easily be wrong.\nVoice 2 \nSnap judgements come from experience. But our experiences of people can be limited. Many of us do not know people of a different ethnicity or race. We mostly know people who are like us. So, when we see someone who looks different, our snap judgements are not based on experience. They are based on ideas from other people. Or they are based on stories in radio and television. These are prejudices. And snap judgements based on prejudice are often wrong. Often, a person’s appearance does not tell us much about who they are or what they are like.\nVoice 1 \nIt is natural to make snap judgements about other people. However, these judgements are not always true. For example, imagine that you see a person with a different skin color than yours. You may have a thought like “I am smarter than he is” or “He is mean”. These are not good snap judgements. Thoughts like these are judgements about a person’s character and abilities.\nVoice 2 \nSometimes, we need to make a quick decision about a person to protect our own lives. If we see someone carrying a weapon, it would be right to make the snap judgement to hide or run away.\nVoice 1 \nPeople make snap judgements every single day. But we can decide how we let the snap judgements affect our lives. It is important to be careful not to let these quick decisions change the way we think of a person. Think of how your snap judgements affect your everyday life. You could surprise yourself.\nVoice 2 \nWe will tell another story about snap judgements for members of our YouTube channel.

This week’s program is about the COVID pandemic and our stories during that pandemic – how the pandemic affected each of us and how people experienced that worldwide problem. This program was written before we knew very much about the Delta variant and other variants that are affecting populations all around the world. And while this program does have a hopeful ending – and I do think that we will get through this – we also want to acknowledge and let you know that we know there is still a lot of pain around COVID around the world. This is not a problem that is going away soon and it needs all of us working together to make it go away and to make it better. So we hope that when you listen to this program you hear about the experiences that people around the world have had. We want to hear about your experiences too. But we also want you to hear the hope that people do have for finally getting through this pandemic. We hope that you enjoy this program.\nVoice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nWe begin today’s program with a story from March 2020.\nVoice 2 \n“It was almost midnight. My roommate and I had been hanging out. It had been more than a week since we had left the house, because of the lockdown. So, we decided to go for a walk. No one was wearing masks, then. But there was also no one around. We walked to an intersection of streets. Normally, it would be crowded with people. Even on the weekdays, many people went to the bars. And a lot of cars travelled through. But there was no one. I remember I walked to the middle of the street. And then I lay down. I lay there for several minutes. No cars came. Nothing that night seemed real. Nothing seemed real for many nights after.”\n\nClick here to follow along on with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThis is a program about the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. 2020 was unlike any other year. A new coronavirus named SARS-COV-2 spread through the whole world. It led to the disease COVID-19. And it changed everyone’s lives. Countries shut down. People had to make big changes to the way they worked, shopped, and had relationships. When the pandemic began, these changes seemed strange. But soon, the restrictions seemed normal. Today’s Spotlight is on the coronavirus pandemic. It is about how that first year felt. We tell stories from different people around the world. We look at their experiences during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA sign saying the world is closed for a time;; Photo by Edwin Hooper on Unsplash\nMany people’s first experience was not with the virus itself. They first experienced measures designed to prevent the virus’ spread. Xiang Zhao is a researcher from Austria. But he is originally from China. He was visiting his family when COVID-19 began to spread. Zhao wrote about his experiences in the journal Health Communication. He wrote,\nVoice 3 \n“Several apartments with infections were blocked by a thick metal bar on the door. This was an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. One night, I walked on a big bridge. I saw the new shopping mall I had not visited yet. I saw the restaurant where I had rice noodles last year. I saw the shop where I got a globe model when I was a child. All of these memories rushed into my head with the beautiful, but empty night view. A strong sense of isolation came over me. I felt extremely alone. I have no previous experience with such an outbreak. I was only a high school student when SARS happened. It did not affect my life very much.”\nVoice 1 \nLoneliness was a common experience with the pandemic. Many people also experienced how terrible the loneliness could be. June Perry lives in the United States. Her father lived in a nursing home, where medical professionals would take care of him. COVID-19 was especially dangerous for older people. Someone in this nursing home caught COVID-19. The disease spread like a fire in a dry forest. And June was not able to see her father. She told NPR:\nVoice 4 \n“We saw my father through the window. It was very, very sad. He had signs of dementia before he went to the nursing home. He did not know that people were dying around him. He did not know that three people near him had died of COVID. Six months after lockdown, he died alone, with nobody beside him.”\nAn empty bench; Photo by Connor Moyle on Unsplash\nVoice 1 \nThe isolation affected all people greatly. Most did not go out to work. They did not see their friends or family. It was like everything in the world had stopped. Several Italian scientists studied this feeling for the journal Frontiers in Psychology. They asked almost 3,000 students about their experiences. One, a 16-year-old, told the scientists:\nVoice 5 \n“It is bad to wake up in the morning knowing that you cannot accomplish anything with your life. You cannot do anything. I look out the window, and it is all deserted. There are no more sounds of cars, buses, or people talking. It is like a changed world, like being in prison for something that you did not do. All I can do is wait and stay at home.”\nVoice 1 \nWhen people caught COVID-19, they were not just afraid for themselves. Being infected meant people close to them could also be infected. This Coronavirus was a very new virus. Scientists did not know very much about it. People did not know how it would affect their loved ones. Angela Brangaccio had just given birth. Then doctors told her she was positive for COVID-19. She was afraid for herself, but she was also afraid for her child. She told to NPR,\nVoice 6 \n“All I knew was that I had this three-month-old baby. I was so scared of anything happening to her. I felt so sick. I could not think how this virus would feel in a three-month-old body. The pain that you feel when you are sick: If my baby feels like this, I cannot go on. <br>In the end, I decided I would move into a different room. I did not spend much time with my baby. I could not kiss her. I kept my mask on all the time. It was so hard. I am not joking when I say it was the worst 14 days of my life.”\nA woman in a mask, with a baby; Image by marcinjozwiak from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nBy the end of 2020, there seemed to be some hope. SARS-COV 2 had destroyed many lives. But countries were also developing vaccines for the virus. The vaccines would protect most people from getting seriously sick if they were infected. Scientists even believed that they might also prevent infection. By early 2021, some countries had vaccinated some of their population.\nIn many places COVID-19 cases began to fall. But there was still a lot to do to beat COVID. Many people still could not get the vaccines. But people began to think that there might be a life beyond the lockdown. They began to imagine a future where everyone could be safe again.\nHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect you? Do you remember when you first heard of COVID-19? What was your experience like?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nListen for a moment to the sounds around you. What do you hear? If you live near a busy street maybe it sounds like this:\nVoice 2 \nBut even in areas far away from busy streets, there can still be a lot of noise. Sometimes this noise can wake you from sleep at night. Other times noise may make it difficult to talk to a friend. This kind of noise is often called noise pollution. It is noise that damages the balance of normal life for people and animals. It can even cause health problems. Today’s Spotlight is on noise pollution.\nVoice 1 \nA lot of noise pollution is caused by transportation. Cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes can all be very loud. And in many cities around the world, people’s homes are very close to these transportation systems. But even things like building tools and music can be noise pollution. It is all around us.\nA busy street in Taipei; Image by Bohdan Chreptak from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nNoise pollution can be a big problem in developing countries. Growing cities and towns are not planned to reduce noise. Many homes and businesses are built next to busy roads. Traffic grows and with it the noise grows.\nVoice 1 \nResearchers have studied the effects of noise in our lives. They have found that it can do more than just take our attention. Noise also harms our health. Most people know that loud noise can permanently damage our ears. But when a person experiences high levels of noise, his heart beats faster. His blood pressure gets higher. Noise can even change the balance of chemicals in a person’s body.\nVoice 2 \nNoise can also affect the way a person sleeps at night. A good night of sleep happens when a person is asleep for a long period of time. This is often called “deep sleep.” But when there is too much noise at night, a person cannot get this deep sleep. Studies show that lack of sleep is connected to many different health problems. If a person is always tired, her body is not as strong. She is not able to fight sickness easily. She may also have a difficult time concentrating on work during the day.\nVoice 1 \nIn the 1970s, researchers in New York City studied the effects of noise on a school. The school was near noisy train tracks. Some of the rooms of the school faced the train tracks. Other rooms were far from the train. The researchers tested children over six years. The children on the noisy side of the school had lower reading scores than the children on the quiet side of the school. The city made the train tracks quieter. And the school built special walls near the tracks to lessen the sound. After this, reading scores improved.\nA noise barrier around a train; Image by bernswaelz from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nBut noise does not just affect humans. Studies show that noise pollution can affect when birds build their nests. Cows feed less and produce less milk when it is noisy. Some studies even show that the growth of some plants can be affected by noise. This is because the noise affects the behavior of the animals around the plants.\nVoice 1 \nLouis Hagler is a doctor in California. He fights for quiet in cities. He believes that cities should treat noise pollution like any other dangerous pollution. He told the Washington Post,\nVoice 3 \n“We do not say to people ‘you just have to learn to live with waste in your water.’ Why should we have to live with waste in our ears?”\nVoice 2 \nBut for many people, the problem of noise is not just about a healthy body. It is also about a healthy, peaceful, mind. For many people, quiet is connected to peace.\nVoice 1 \nIn some religions, holy men and women have special times of silence. Some of these people make a promise not to speak for a period of time. This can be very difficult. But these men and women see their silence as a way to control themselves and honor God.\nVoice 2 \nAll around the world people make their voices quiet to respect others. People are quiet in cemeteries, where people bury the dead. They are quiet in museums where people learn about art or history. They are quiet in libraries where people read books. People also use silence as a way to honor people who have died. Often, at special events or celebrations, people will have a moment of silence. This is a short time when large groups of people quiet their voices to remember the dead. Quiet and silence is special. It is important.\nVoice 1 \nBut finding quiet places in a busy world can be difficult. Noise is all around, and sometimes you cannot avoid it. But you can reduce noise in your life. Here are some ways to get rid of noise in your life.\nVoice 4 \nTurn off any electrical devices you are not using. These devices can create a low level of noise, even when someone is not using them.\nVoice 3 \nIf you have to raise your voice when you are talking to someone, something is wrong. Look for what is creating noise around you and what you can do to control it.\nVoice 4 \nPlay music at a level that only you can hear, or only inside.\nVoice 3 \nYou can reduce noise coming into and going out of your home by planting tall plants around your home. These plants can block some of the noise that you create.\nVoice 4 \nYou can also reduce noise inside your home. Hang blankets or fabric on your walls. Put soft rugs or carpet on your floors. These things will help stop noise from reflecting off hard surfaces.\nVoice 3  \nInstead of driving a car or riding a motorbike, ride a bicycle instead. This will reduce noise on the roads.\nA person enjoying quiet and peace; Image by OyeHaHa from Pixabay\nVoice 4 \nAnd finally, value the quiet places you do know. If you have children, take them to quiet areas and let them listen. Teach them to value quiet in their lives. Make sure to include time for quiet in your own life.\nVoice 2 \nHow do you escape noise and find quiet? Is there a lot of noise pollution by where you live? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nYunzhe Zhou is a job coach. She helps people who are tired of their jobs and need a change. She tells people to try and connect with something that makes them excited and gives them energy. She spoke to the magazine Fast Company:\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 3 \n“If you are giving 1000% percent at your current job, and you still feel like something is missing, it is a good sign that it may not be the right direction.”\nVoice 2 \nBut it is not always easy to find the right direction. This is why one ancient idea is becoming popular again: the sabbatical. This time away from work can bring ideas, energy, and a new direction. Today’s Spotlight is on sabbaticals.\nVoice 1 \nThe idea of a Sabbatical began with the ancient Hebrew law called Sabbath. Traditionally, Jewish people believe that God created the world in six days. On the seventh day, God rested. They believe that God created people to work for six days and then rest for one day. Yet, sabbaticals are no longer just a religious idea. Experts around the world agree that resting from work is good for all people.\nVoice 2 \nA sabbatical is not a vacation. A vacation is a time away from work to rest, travel, or spend time with people we love. But a sabbatical is different. Traditionally, a sabbatical is a year off work to travel or study. A person may or may not receive payment for this year. The company Remote Year helps people travel the world while still working over the Internet. They explained sabbaticals on the company website:\nVoice 4 \n“Sabbaticals are not defined by the lack of work. They are defined by the presence of work. People who are taking sabbaticals today are not taking time off from work for relaxation. They are following another kind of personal or professional work. They are using this time to follow their dreams. They may work to create something that they have been dreaming about for years. They are using it to do a project that they have not been able to work on for years.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe most common place where people take sabbatical is in university. Usually, a professor gets a sabbatical every seven years. A professor on sabbatical does not have to teach students or meet with other professors. But that does not mean they do nothing. Many professors travel to a new country. Others write a book. Some finish  a research project. Many professors return with new energy and new ideas. The sabbatical is good for the school, the students, and the professor.\nVoice 2 \nIn recent years, many businesses noticed that it was not working well to ask people to work more and more. These companies began to offer workers a sabbatical. Two major businesses that offer sabbatical options are McDonald’s and Nike. Some banks and law and accounting firms offer them too. Some companies require a person on sabbatical to volunteer or further their education. But other companies place no requirements on what a person must do.\nClick here to see our playlist about English for Work\nVoice 1 \nIt is easy to understand how a break from work can help a person. But will a break from work help a company? How can working less make someone a better worker? David Burkus is a teacher at Oral Roberts University. He speaks at conferences about leadership. He wrote about sabbaticals for the Harvard Business Review:\nVoice 5 \n“The research found that people who took sabbaticals experienced less stress and an increase in overall well-being. Those positive changes often remained long after the people returned to work. The employees benefit from time away, but the organization benefits as well. The majority of people said the time away gave them the space to have ideas for new projects.”\nImage by Free-Photos from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSabbatical programs are still not offered to most people. Does this mean that sabbaticals are only for a few people who teach at a university or work at a company that offers sabbaticals? How can a farmer take a sabbatical? Or a builder? Or writer?\nVoice 1 \nMost people in the world work in places where they only get paid if they work. If they do not come to work, they risk losing their position. But as companies around the world start to see the advantage of offering sabbaticals, more are beginning to offer them.\nVoice 2 \nThe Hilton Hotel gave sabbaticals to workers from Sri Lanka and Singapore. Starbucks Coffee offers some workers in China up to a year-long sabbatical. In India there has been increasing interest in sabbaticals. People are finding ways to work less, travel, and experience life. Mario D’Souza works in marketing. He wanted to take a sabbatical, but his company did not offer one. He decided to make his own sabbatical. He told Fortune India:\nVoice 6 \n“I had to plan for this break. I do not get paid for this time. So I have had to think through expenses. I stopped doing things such as eating out, watching films and ordering food. But it has been great! The amount of money I spent on these kind of things was amazing. I only understood when I made myself do this.”\nVoice 1 \nBut what about people who cannot afford to take time away from work? Everyone needs time to rest from their work. There are several ways that people can make rest part of their lives.\nVoice 2 \nThe first idea is to take one day off from work each week. You rest, spend time with family, or gather with your religious community. The second thing is to take one day each month and disconnect from everything. Leave your phone at home and go outside. Walk through nature. Sit and do nothing. Slow down and think about your life.\nImage by Fabricio Macedo FGMsp from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nMaybe your life does not permit either of those things. One final thing may still be possible: disconnect for one hour each day. One hour each day may not feel possible. So, start with ten minutes and then build up to one hour. By taking this time you will be more productive. But you may also live a happier life!\nVoice 2 \nIf you could take a sabbatical, what would you do? Have you taken a sabbatical before?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nA mother sits and rocks her baby to sleep. She sings quietly. She wants the baby to fall asleep. She sings this song about a cradle – a small bed for a baby:\nVoice 3 \nRock-a-bye baby in the tree top.When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.When the branch breaks, the cradle will fall.And down will come baby, cradle and all.\n\n\nClick here to follow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nRock-a-bye Baby is a rhyming song from England. The sentences rhyme – they end with the same sounds like ‘fall’ and ‘all’. Rhyming songs and poems are very popular all around the world. Parents often sing them to young children. And children sing them in nursery school – when they are only three or four years old. Today’s Spotlight is on nursery rhymes around the world.\nVoice 1 \nMost countries have nursery rhymes. People sing nursery rhymes like a song. Or sometimes they say nursery rhymes like a poem. Nursery rhymes are fun for both adults and children. But nursery rhymes also have other purposes.\nVoice 2 \nThere are different kinds of nursery rhymes. Some nursery rhymes are for helping a child to fall asleep. “Rock-a-bye Baby” is one of these. Other nursery rhymes are educational. They teach children about cultural traditions or about good behavior. Some nursery rhymes are games – they include movements. The children must do these movements with their hands or bodies.\nVoice 1 \nLet’s listen to some different kinds of nursery rhymes from around the world. This first nursery rhyme is from Uganda in East Africa:\nVoice 4\nKeep keep keep your healthEat good food!Milk and eggs, fish and beansAre excellent for you.Comb comb comb your hairDo not forget your teeth!Brush brush brush your teethClean up all those germs!\nChild brushing teeth; Image by Rajesh Balouria from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThis nursery rhyme teaches children about healthy food. And it teaches children to take care of their bodies. Because it has rhyming sounds, this song is easy to remember! Parents and teachers often use songs to teach lessons. Songs can help children to remember important things – like cleaning their teeth.\nVoice 1 \nThe next nursery rhyme also uses rhyming to teach. This poem is from China. It teaches about the traditional customs of a very important Chinese holiday. It is called ‘Chinese New Year’:\nVoice 5\nYou will find whenever the New Year comesthe Kitchen God will want some plums.The girls will want some flowers new;The boys will want firecrackers, too.A new soft hat will please PapaAnd a sugar cake for dear Mama.\nVoice 2 \nThis nursery rhyme teaches children about the special customs of the Chinese New Year holiday. For example, families celebrate Chinese New Year with special food. The nursery rhyme also teaches children to share with their family members. By repeating this rhyme, children will remember their traditional customs.\nVoice 1 \nMany cultures also have nursery rhymes to teach children about right and wrong actions. Here is a nursery rhyme from Thailand. It is named after a large fruit. The jackfruit has a hard, green skin. But inside, it has soft, yellow fruit around big seeds:\nVoice 6\nJum-Jee Jackfruit SeedThose who have done good deedsCan eat all the food.Those who tell liesMust eat old dead dog!\nJackfruit; Image by Dean Moriarty from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThis nursery rhyme teaches children to tell the truth. It explains that people who tell the truth will get good things. But people who do not tell the truth will not get good things.\nVoice 1 \nThere are two more interesting things about this nursery rhyme. One is that it uses words that are not real! The beginning words – “Jum-Jee” – do not mean anything. These are just words that sound fun. They rhyme to make the song sound good. Many nursery rhymes have these kinds of words in them.\nVoice 2 \nThe Jum-Jee nursery rhyme is also a game. While the children sing it, they sit in a circle. They all put their hands into the middle. Then, one child counts the other children’s fingers while they sing together. When the song is finished, the child stops counting. The person with the finger last counted must pull their hand away. The song continues until only one child has a hand left in the middle of the circle.\nVoice 1 \nMany other nursery rhymes can also be used for games. Some have special motions for the children to do. They sing and move parts of their bodies at the same time. Listen to this nursery rhyme from Switzerland in Europe. It is a rhyme about a child named Joggeli riding a horse. Imagine how children would move while saying it.\nVoice 7\nJoggeli, can you ride?Yes, yes, yes.Have you got one leg each side?Yes, yes, yes.Did you give the horse some hay?Yes, yes, yes.Did you water it today?Nay, nay, nay.So let’s ride to townAnd go three times around.But then the horse starts buckingAnd Joggeli falls down down down.\nVoice 2 \nNursery rhymes can teach many things! They can teach children about being healthy and behaving well. They also teach about traditional culture. Nursery rhymes often use language in a fun way. And they can be used for movements or games. But one of the most important things about nursery rhymes is that they help create relationships.\nVoice 1 \nNursery rhymes help children create friendships with each other. They help teachers to give good lessons. And they also help create closeness between a child and her parent. Nursery rhymes are a way for parents to teach important lessons.\nVoice 2 \nLastly, parents use nursery rhymes to put their children to sleep – like the first rhyme we heard.  The last nursery rhyme is also a song from a parent to his child. The child is named Iro. This rhyme is from the Mina language of Benin, in West Africa. It shows the most important lesson that a parent can teach a child: that her mother and father love her.\nVoice 8\nMy Iro, what am I going to give you?My Iro, what am I going to give you?I have nothing to give you I am going to pray for you.Your life will be happy for all time.\nImage by rbalouria from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nWhat is your favorite nursery rhyme?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nIn 2005 many people watched the documentary “March of the Penguins.” This film continues to be popular today. The film shows a real group of birds in Antarctica. It is about their journey to mate and raise their young. But these birds do not fly. The penguins walk together across the ice of Antarctica. Imagine a group of fat black and white birds walking in a line. Suddenly, one penguin loses his balance. He falls on the ice. This happens a few times in the film. Every time penguins fall down people watching the film laugh. The penguins are cute!\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2\nPeople liked the film very much. So much, in fact, that police in England think that it may be the reason behind a crime. A man went to a zoo in London and stole a baby penguin. Authorities think that the man stole the penguin after seeing the film. They believe he wanted to give it away as a Christmas gift.\nVoice 1\nWhat is it about these animals that make people spend money to see a film many times? Why would someone break the law to steal an animal? Today’s Spotlight is on the science behind what makes something cute!\nVoice 2\nMichel Gauthier-Clerc studies penguins. He thinks that many people like penguins. But some people do not understand them. He told the New York Times newspaper,\nVoice 3\n“People love the penguin’s way of standing straight upright. They like its colors, which look like human clothes – a tuxedo suit. And they like the way it waddles as it walks. How like a child playing dress-up in adult clothes!”\nImage by Siggy Nowak from Pixabay \nVoice 1\nThese things make penguins seem cute to people. But there are good reasons for all of these things. For example, the way penguins walk. Penguins move from side to side when they walk. People call this way of walking ‘waddling.’ The penguins may seem to be out of balance. But Doctor Gauthier-Clerc says that the penguins waddle to save energy. In cold Antarctica, penguins must keep warm. The penguins’ colour also has a special purpose. It protects the penguins when they are swimming. From below, larger animals cannot see the penguin’s white underside. It looks the same as the bright sky or ice. And from above, other animals cannot see the penguin’s black back against the dark ocean floor.\nVoice 2\nThe penguins’ colours protect them in nature. But scientists have found that some of these physical details also have an effect on humans. These scientists study visual signaling. The way an animal looks sends a message to other animals, and to people. Some of these visual signals make animals seem cute to people.\nVoice 1\nIf something is cute, it is beautiful in a special way. Cuteness is a special kind of beauty that makes people happy. Some physical characteristics that people think are cute are big round ears and arms and legs that seem weak. Scientists call these physical details “cute cues.” Cute cues are those things that make something look young, weak, harmless, or needy. Scientists say that humans react to these cues. Humans have a desire to care for things that look and act similar to babies.\nVoice 2\nPeople often find babies to be very cute. An adult may have a strong desire to hold a baby and kiss her because she is so cute. Spotlight producer Joshua Leo has a baby daughter. He describes why she is so cute:\nVoice 4 \n“My baby has a very round head. Her head is still very big compared to her body. Her eyes are low on her face and they look big. She has smooth skin and soft hair. My baby daughter does not have much control over her body. She cannot yet move her arms and legs very well.”\nImage by btchurch from Pixabay \nVoice 1\nScientists believe that humans are very sensitive to things that are cute. Humans react to anything that looks similar to a human baby. Humans even react to objects that may look like parts of a baby. Humans react to the soft hair on a baby bird, the movement of a round balloon, a small round car, or even a large round rock on top of a smaller rock! The more cute cues that an animal or object has, the more people may like it.\nVoice 2\nResearchers are still learning about the science of cuteness. Recent studies show that cute images affect the brain in a special way. Cute images make the brain react in a similar way to a good meal or some drugs. Cute things make us feel happy.\nVoice 1\nCute images have a lot of power. A study done at the University of Michigan in the United States showed this to be true. The study tested young people’s reactions to images. It found that young people believed messages more if the message was joined by a cute picture. The researchers showed the young people two messages. One was a simple anti-smoking message. The other showed a cute animal telling them that smoking was bad. Then the researchers tested the young people’s reactions. The young people trusted the cute messages more than the simple message.\nVoice 2\nExperts say that every human on the planet is made to react to cute images. But some cultures react to cuteness more than others. They say this is similar to the love of sugar. Everyone is able to taste sweet things. But some people and some countries eat more sweet foods than other people.\nVoice 1\nFor example, many people in the country of Japan like cute things very much. In Japan cute things are called “Kawaii.” Images of people and animals with big heads and big eyes are on many things. Children love Kawaii animals. But these cute things are not only for children. Many Japanese men and women also like Kawaii.\nKawaii kitten; Image by Eduardo RS from Pixabay \nVoice 2\nCuteness attracts people. People want to hold and care for cute things. God made humans in a special way. He made us to naturally react to cute things. People are made to protect the helpless things in life, such as small babies. When people see something cute they want to care for it. God gave people this reaction. This way we remember to take good care of things that cannot care for themselves.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Joshua Leo. The producer was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nSeventeen hundred years ago, in the city of Rome, a man was put in prison. He was a Christian believer. And he had not obeyed the Emperor. He was sentenced to be executed. While this man was in prison, he met a young woman. She was the daughter of the prison guard. She visited this man’s prison cell often. They could not always talk together. So he and the woman began to pass notes to each other through the prison bars. They fell in love with each other. When it was time for the prison to execute the man, he sent her one last letter. The last note he sent to her was a love note. He ended it, “from, your Valentine.”\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2  \nSome people believe that this is the story that started the holiday we now know as Valentine’s Day. All around the world people celebrate this holiday on February 14th. They celebrate it in many different ways. But the message is the same everywhere — love! Today’s Spotlight is on Valentine’s Day!\nVoice 1  \nNo one really knows if this story about the man, named Valentine, and the prison guard’s daughter is true. The holiday is actually named after at least two men, both named Valentine. Historians, people who study history, have little information about either of these men. Both men died because of their Christian faith – one died in 197 and one in 269. Historians believe that both men died on February 14th. Later, the Christian church recognized these men as saints — people of strong faith. And February 14th became Saint Valentine’s Day.\nVintage Valentine; Image by Oberholster Venita from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nHistorical documents show that, originally, Valentine’s Day had little to do with love. A recorded link between Valentine’s Day and love did not appear until about 1,200 years later.\nVoice 1  \nIn 1382 Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a poem about love. He was a famous English Poet. The poem told about birds coming together half-way through the second month of the year. The birds met on Valentine’s Day, to mate. The poem influenced many people. And soon after, other writers began to use these ideas in their own writing. The link between Valentine’s Day and love became common!\nVoice 2  \nBy the 17th century, Valentine’s Day was celebrated all over Great Britain. About a hundred years later, people began to exchange small gifts or notes on Valentine’s Day. These gifts were an expression of love between family, friends, and lovers.\nVoice 1  \nToday, many people still celebrate Valentine’s Day in this way. They send a greeting card. These are usually just a simple paper note that expresses love or devotion. A person can send a Valentine’s Day greeting card to his lover, his parents, his co-worker, or even his doctor! In fact, the Greeting Card Association says that world-wide, people send over one billion greeting cards every Valentine’s Day!\nVoice 2  \nPeople in Canada, Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Australia all celebrate Valentine’s Day this way. But greeting cards are not the only thing people give or do. People may go out to a special dinner. They may buy each other a present, or just some good-tasting candy or chocolate. Other countries do different things.\nVoice 1  \nOn Valentine’s Day in Japan, women give sweet candy, chocolate or flowers to people they like. They call this chocolate ‘giri-choko.’ In Japanese, the word ‘giri’ means obligation, or, something someone must do. And ‘choko’ is a short form of the word for chocolate. A woman may also give ‘honmei-choko’ to a person she loves or is in a relationship with. Or she can give ‘tomo-choko’ to her friends.\nGiri-choko; “Happy valentines” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by chidorian\nVoice 2  \nThis may seem nice for the men. But men who received honmei-choko must also give the women a present. This happens on White Day, one month later. On that day, a man must give the woman a present worth two to three times more than the present he got! Sora News 24 is a Japanese news site. It shared results of a survey about this tradition. Most men do not like it. In the survey, one Japanese man wrote:\nVoice 3  \n“I like getting the chocolates. But I hate having to buy every girl something in return. Honmei-choco is even worse, because you have to buy something super expensive on White Day!”\nVoice 1  \nIn Finland they celebrate ‘Friend’s Day’ on February 14. This is not only a day for people in love. But, it is a day for celebrating and remembering your friends.\nVoice 2  \nSome places do not celebrate Valentine’s Day at all. But they do celebrate a different day for love. People living in Brazil celebrate ‘Boyfriend or Girlfriend Day.’ On June 12th, people in love exchange gifts like chocolates, cards, flowers, and even special clothes. Some women even use this day to perform special customs. They believe these customs will help them find a good boyfriend or husband.\nVoice 1  \nColombians celebrate ‘Love and Friendship Day’ on the 3rd Friday and Saturday in September. And many groups of people join in a popular tradition called ‘amigo secreto’ or ‘secret friend.’ Each member of the group chooses another member’s name by chance. He gives the person he chose a gift on this day.\nVoice 2  \nSo, people in different places celebrate a day like Valentine’s Day. They may celebrate it at a different time of the year. They may give gifts or greeting cards. They may write a special note to many people or to only one person. But there is a common idea in all of these actions. Valentine’s Day is a time to think about the people around you. It is a time to think about the people you love.\nImage by Gennaro Leonardi from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nIt is important for people to feel loved. But often, we do not express our love for the people around us. So, Valentine’s Day offers people the perfect chance to tell other people how much you value them. Tell your wife or husband, or girlfriend or boyfriend how much you love them. Tell your parents or children how wonderful they are. Tell your friends how much you like to see them.\nVoice 2  \nDo you love someone? You should tell them! Then, tell US about what makes them so wonderful! You can leave a comment on our website.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 3        \nOnce upon a time, there was a very strong woodcutter. A king hired him to cut down trees. The pay was good. And the work conditions were good too. The woodcutter wanted to do his best. The king gave him a sharp axe to cut the trees. He showed the woodcutter the area where he would work.\nThe first day, the woodcutter cut 18 trees. The king was pleased. The woodcutter was encouraged. So, he tried harder the next day. But he could only cut 15 trees. Each day he cut fewer and fewer trees. The woodcutter wondered if he was becoming weak.\nHe told the king that he did not understand what was happening. The King asked, “When was the last time you sharpened your axe?” The woodcutter replied, “Sharpen my axe? I had no time for that! I have been too busy cutting trees!”\nImage by Jot-Be from Pixabay\nVoice 1        \nMayo Oshin wrote this story for the website Thrive Global. The point of the story is that sometimes people work more and more. But they forget what is important. With a small fix, they could be working smarter. Today’s Spotlight is on managing time to do more.\nVoice 2        \nEveryone has things they need to do. These things can be school, work, or things at home. People may need to care for children, fix a broken window, or sit through a meeting at work. These are all important things. They all take time and attention. But everyone also has things they want to do. These could include finishing school, writing a book, or learning a new language. These things help us change, improve, or add to the world. So how do you balance the things you need to do with the things you want to do?\nVoice 1        \nYou can learn to use your time in better ways. Maybe like the woodcutter in the beginning of this program, you just need to sharpen your axe! You may need to just work in a smarter way. Here are six tools of time management you can use.\nVoice 2        \nThe first tool of time management is to remember the big picture. Instead of thinking about all the things you have to do, think about where you want to be in one year. Write it on a piece of paper. Put it where you will see it every day. It could be in your kitchen or bathroom. You could make it into the wallpaper on your phone. This will remind you of your bigger goals.\nVoice 1        \nThe second tool of managing your time well is to plan out your week. When you plan out a week, you can make sure that you are spending time on things that are important. Plan out everything! Plan time for work, but also plan time for learning, exercise, rest, and time with family and friends. You may think this means you cannot have any fun. But a good plan can create freedom. Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky wrote a book called “Make Time”. In it, they write,\nImage by Shiv Mirthyu from Pixabay \nVoice 4        \n“When you do not have a plan, you have to always decide what to do next. You can use a lot of time thinking about all the things you should or could do. But a completely planned day provides the freedom to concentrate on the moment. You do not have to think about what to do next. You can trust the plan set out by your past self.”\nVoice 2        \nA good plan is a good start. But this is only the beginning. The third way to manage your time is to avoid distractions and interruptions. Distractions and interruptions stop us from concentrating on something. When we are distracted, we lose the progress on that important work. Deep Patel wrote about distractions for the website Entrepreneur.com\nVoice 5        \n“Even with the best of effort, we still look at social media when we should be working on a project. We touch our cell phone when we hear a noise. If we are not checking our email every five minutes, we worry we may miss something important. Statistics show that distractions cause a huge loss in productivity. Employees spend 28 percent of their time dealing with interruptions and then trying to get back to work.”\nVoice 1        \nDistractions and interruptions are everywhere. But the fourth way to manage time is to minimize distractions. You cannot avoid all distractions – that is impossible! But you can try to have fewer distractions in your day. Turn off your phone. Turn the internet off on your computer. If possible, go somewhere that is not your office. Even if you only focus for an hour, you can get a lot done. There is very little in life or work that cannot wait one hour.\nImage by Michal Jarmoluk from Pixabay \nVoice 2        \nThe fifth way to manage your time is to do your most important thing at the beginning of the day. Oshin explains,\nVoice 3        \n“As a rule, plan your most important and creative work in the early hours of waking up. This is when you have the most energy. On the other side, you could plan your low creative work, such as email, social media, or phone calls later in the day. This is when your energy is lowest.”\nVoice 1        \nThe sixth, and final way to manage your time is to know when to stop working. Many people take their work home. They even bring their phones into bed with them. People are always connected to each other and their work. In a survey from Forbes, 82 percent of people say they stay connected to the office even when they go home. The same survey said 50 percent are still connected when they go to bed.\nVoice 2        \nManaging time can help us get more work done. But it can also help us do more of the things we want. Following these tips can help you do both. Then you can follow one common English saying: Work smarter, not harder.\nVoice 1        \nHow do you plan your week? Do you use an app? Do you write a list of things to do? What is your best tip for time management? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight is on New Year’s resolutions. People celebrate the beginning of each year at different times depending on their cultural traditions. But one of the most common times to celebrate the New Year is by the Gregorian calendar. People also call this way of measuring days, months and years the Western or Christian calendar. On this calendar, the first day of the new year is January 1st. People call this holiday “New Year’s Day”.\nClick here to follow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nPeople love to celebrate New Year’s Day. Some celebrate with parties and music. They may sing traditional songs about old times and good friends. Some people celebrate quietly with family and friends. Other people go to church on New Year’s Day. People may ask each other, and God, for forgiveness for the wrong things that happened the year before. People can leave their mistakes in the old year. Instead, they look to the future. They think about how they can make the new year better, or different, than the year before.\nVoice 1 \nOne common way people try to make a new beginning is by making New Year’s resolutions. A New Year’s resolution is a promise you make to yourself. It usually means a change of behavior or a new goal. For example:\nVoice 3 \nThis year, I promise to eat healthy food.\nVoice 4 \nThis year, I promise to exercise more.\nVoice 3 \nI promise to give more money to the poor.\nVoice 4 \nI promise to be kind to my sister.\nVoice 3 \nI promise to finish school this year.\nVoice 2 \nPeople believe that the first New Year’s resolutions were made thousands of years ago by the Babylonians. The most popular New Year’s resolution for the ancient Babylonians was to return borrowed farm equipment! Today, the most popular New Year’s resolutions are usually ways for people to improve themselves. People promise to do things like stop smoking or pay back money that they owe. People also commonly make resolutions about relationships and health.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nOn the first day of the New Year people feel great about the changes they hope to make. But what happens after some time has passed? Experts say that most people do not keep their resolutions for very long! The University of Scranton in the United States studied New Year’s resolutions in 2014. They found that one week after New Year’s Day only 75% of people have kept their resolutions. This number drops down to 65% after one month. Less than half of people keep their New Year’s resolutions for more than six months.\nVoice 2 \nThere are many reasons why people often do not keep their resolutions. The main reason is that it is difficult to make changes. But there are a few ways to make it easier to make good changes. Spotlight producers Michio Ozaki, Bruce Gulland and Rena Dam each share a way to make – and keep, resolutions:\nVoice 5 \nBe realistic and detailed. Many people make a goal that is too big or not clear. Your resolution may be to learn English better. But you may not know how to make that happen! Instead, make a resolution that is smaller and more detailed. For example, “I will listen to a Spotlight English program two times every week.” Or, “I will speak English every day.” Making smaller goals will help you to get better at the exact thing you want to do. It will also make you able to measure your success. And that will be encouraging!\nVoice 6 \nGet as much support as you can. Ask other people to help you remember your resolutions. When you make a promise to someone else, it is easy to remember. It will also make you want to keep your resolution. Some people make resolutions with someone else. For example, if you wanted to exercise more, you could plan to exercise with a friend. Then you can encourage each other and have fun too. Even if you have no one to help you keep your resolution, there are websites on the internet that offer help. One website sends encouraging information about your resolution, such as information about exercising. The website will even send emails to help you remember your resolution.\nVoice 7 \nStart one new healthy habit to replace every unhealthy one. Many people make New Year’s resolutions to stop bad habits. These habits may be things like eating unhealthy food, or playing too many video games. It is difficult just to stop a habit. Instead, replace it with something else. For example, instead of eating unhealthy food snacks, plan healthy things to eat. Make a resolution to eat more fruits and vegetables. Or, in the case of video games, replace the habit with something healthier. Make a resolution to get more exercise. At the times you would play a video game, play a sport with your friends instead.\nImage by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay\nHowever, sometimes a bad habit is not just a habit. Sometimes a bad habit is really an addiction. Substances like cigarettes or alcohol can cause dependence. A person’s mind or body depends on these substances. For example, when you stop using cigarettes, you may feel sick. You will want the cigarettes very badly. Stopping an addiction is much more difficult than stopping a bad habit. If you are stopping an addiction, look for more help. Visit our website for more ideas.\nVoice 1 \nIt is also good to remember that no one is perfect. Even if we fail one day, we can keep working on our resolutions. The Christian Bible uses the word perseverance to talk about keeping promises. Perseverance means continuing to do something even if it is difficult. To persevere, a person needs to be patient and strong. But we do not have to struggle alone. The Bible also says that God will be with us and help us:\nVoice 3  \n“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans for good and not for evil, plans to give you a future and a hope.”\nVoice 2 \nWith this hope, it is easier to have perseverance. People may forget their New Year’s resolutions or want to give up. But everyone can remember these helpful ideas: Make detailed goals and get help from friends. Start new good habits as you stop old bad ones. Remind yourself and others that you are not alone. And with perseverance, good changes can last throughout the whole year.\nImage by Shad0wfall from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe writers of this program were Sara DeKoster and Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nToday’s Spotlight is on laughter!\nVoice 2  \nLord Byron was an English poet who lived 200 years ago. He said,\nVoice 3  \n‘Always laugh when you can. It is cheap medicine.’\nVoice 1  \nCharles Dickens was a famous English writer in the 19th century. In his book ‘A Christmas Carol’ he said,\nVoice 4  \n‘There is nothing in the world so infectious as laughter and good humour.’\nVoice 2  \nMartin Luther King Junior was a leader in the US Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. He said,\nVoice 5  \n‘It is cheerful to God when you rejoice or laugh from the bottom of your heart.’\nVoice 1  \nAt about the same time Audrey Hepburn was a Hollywood film actor. She said,\nVoice 6  \n‘I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think laughing is the thing I like most. It cures a lot of problems. It is probably the most important thing in a person.’\nVoice 2  \nThese people describe laughter as a medicine, an infection, praise to God, and the thing they like most. How can it be all these things? We often laugh at jokes and funny stories. But scientists have studied laughter. They tell us that laughter is about far more than jokes and funny stories.\nPhoto by Hannah Nelson from Pexels\nVoice 1  \nProfessor Robert Provine is a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland in the United States. He discovered that we are 30 times more likely to laugh when we are with other people. He said that laughter is a signal we send to other people. It is a sort of language. If we are alone, laughter almost disappears. In the web journal Psychology Today he explains,\nVoice 7  \n‘Laughter is mainly a social voice that joins people together. It is a hidden language that we all speak. It is not a learned group reaction. It is a natural behaviour.’\nPhoto by bradford zak on Unsplash\nVoice 2  \nProfessor Sophie Scott is a neuroscientist too. She works in the United Kingdom at University College London. She is also a part-time comedian. She tells jokes to audiences. She wrote for the BBC about how this laughing language works. When we talk with our friends we laugh at their comments. The comments may not even be funny. But we show our friends that we like them and agree with them by laughing. She writes,\nVoice 8  \n‘The science of laughter is telling us that laughter is less to do with jokes and more a social behaviour. We use it to show people that we like them and that we understand them.’\nVoice 1  \nSo we all speak the “language” of laughter. And we all recognise laughter. But people in different cultures use humour and laughter in different ways. People in one culture may find something funny. But people in another culture may not find the same thing funny. And people in different cultures do not always agree WHEN it is correct behaviour to laugh. People in the United Kingdom and the United States may use humour in a business meeting. But people from Germany or Japan would not usually do this.\nVoice 2  \nPeople can also catch laughter. For example, one friend will start to laugh. And then another joins in. And then another and another. You may have experienced this. Earlier we heard that Charles Dickens said that laughter is infectious. This makes laughter sound like a disease. In fact, in an incident from 1962, laughter seemed like a virus. In that year three girls started to laugh at their school in Tanzania. They could not stop laughing. More girls started to laugh. Six weeks later 95 girls were laughing and could not stop. The school had to close. The laughing spread to other schools and villages. By the end of the incident, about 1,000 people had been affected.\nVoice 1  \nBut for most people laughing is not a problem. As Lord Byron suggested, laughter can be like a medicine. Many researchers have studied how laughter has the power to reduce pain. In one study, researchers tested how long people could suffer pain. They did this by putting something frozen on people’s arms. Half of the group watched something funny. The other half watched something neutral. The researchers found that people who had watched something funny increased the time they could suffer pain.\nVoice 2  \nProfessor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University led this research. He believes that when we have great big laughs the body releases natural chemicals called endorphins. These chemicals act as pain killers. Other experts have suggested that laughing makes us think about other things than the pain. Or, laughing makes muscles relax, so they are not painful anymore.\nPhoto by Brian Lundquist on Unsplash\nVoice 1  \nMany scientific studies show that humour also has a positive effect on the immune system. This is the system that defends a body from infections. Paul McGhee is an expert who writes and speaks about laughter in the United States. He advises,\nVoice 5  \n‘Building more laughter into your life helps you to have all the natural healing resources of your body ready for use.’\nVoice 2  \nOther experts believe that laughter may even help prevent heart disease. Michael Miller is the Director of the Center for Preventative Cardiology at the University of Maryland in the United States. He has been involved in research in this area. He says,\nVoice 9  \n‘The recommendation for a healthy heart may one day be exercise, eat right and laugh a few times a day.\nVoice 1  \nYou may now think of laughter as being like medicine. But could it be medicine for a nation too? In South Sudan the United Nations Mission in South Sudan even tried to use laughter as a way to help heal a nation. South Sudan has suffered from a civil war. In 2016 South Sudan held a festival called ‘Let Us Laugh’. During the event comedians told jokes about politics and life.\nVoice 2  \nA UN press release about the event told about Tong Tong. He is a student in South Sudan. He explained why the event was so important.\nVoice 10  \n“This is good for South Sudan. It is the way to go for peace. Laughing together is good, because if we can all laugh together at the same things it will be harder to see each other as enemies. We can be friends instead of fighting each other.”\nVoice 1  \nWhat makes you laugh? Has laughing ever helped you? Tell us what you think on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nWhen Guy was a young man, he had a problem. He liked to gamble. He played games to try and win money. Guy told Addiction.com how his problem started.\nVoice 3 \n“It all started when I won 100 pounds on a lottery card. After that I went to the betting shop to gamble on sports. And I played the machines in the shops. I did this almost every day. On some days I won some good money. But overall it did cost me a lot. What the average person does not understand is that gambling is an illness. It is like taking drugs. And just like drugs, it is also very difficult to stop. People think you gamble to win money. But to a gambler, money does not mean anything. It is what lets you keep playing. The gambler is likely doing it to escape his or her problems. I would gamble to escape my depression and fears. It’s a process; you win, you spend and you lose.\nLottery Cards; Image by Hermann Traub from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nMillions of people around the world are just like Guy. Some people gamble to have fun. Other people gamble and destroy their lives. Today’s Spotlight is on gambling.\nVoice 1 \nGambling is a big business everywhere in the world. Gambling creates over 500 billion dollars each year. This includes playing games of chance. It also includes games with some skill, such as card games like Poker or Blackjack. It can include trying to choose who will win a particular sporting event.\nVoice 2 \nGambling happens in almost every country. And yet, gambling is illegal in many parts of the world. Governments of many countries believe that gambling is not a healthy thing to do. This includes countries like Brazil, China, Indonesia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Other countries permit gambling, but only under strong laws. They may only permit gambling in particular cities or buildings. In these countries, when people break gambling laws they may go to prison.\nGambling at Grand Hotel De Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the CongoPhoto by Kay on Unsplash\nVoice 1 \nCountries make gambling illegal because it is dangerous. People think they can win a lot of money. But people can become addicted to gambling. They cannot stop. They spend more and more money. For example, studies have found that in the United States, three to four million people are addicted to gambling.\nVoice 2 \nExperts give two reasons that gambling addiction has become such a big problem around the world. First, people are starting to understand the addictive power of gambling. Ferris Jabr is an editor at Scientific American magazine. He wrote about the power of gambling.\nVoice 4 \n“Not long ago people did not believe that a person could become addicted to gambling the same way a person gets addicted to a drug. Now scientists agree that in some cases gambling is a true addiction. Research shows that gamblers and drug users both share some qualities. They both make fast choices and want fast rewards. A drug user requires stronger and stronger amounts to get high. A gambler will attempt games with more and more risk.”\nVoice 1 \nThe second reason that gambling addiction is a problem is that the games have changed. Years ago, people played mostly games that required a high level of skill. These were card games like poker, baccarat, or blackjack. Before you played, you had to learn the rules. You often had to travel to a special city in order to gamble.\nVoice 2 \nThe Internet has changed both of those things. A person who wants to gamble can do so at home on their computer. There are a lot of guides online that teach people how to play the games. Sports gambling is always very popular. But now people also like to gamble on fantasy sports and e-sports, such as video game competitions.\nVoice 1 \nAnd some gambling requires no skill at all! Casinos are public places where people can gamble. One of the most popular casino games is a slot machine. Traditional slot machines have a small space, or slot, to put in a coin. But today, many use a digital card instead. These machines require no skill. People do not even need to talk to anyone else. They just press a button again and again, hoping to win money.\nSlot Machines; Photo by Amit Lahav on Unsplash\nVoice 2 \nGambling may seem harmless at first. But gambling’s biggest secret is that it can destroy your life. Terry White lives in Wales. He was addicted to gambling and it cost him everything. He explained to the BBC,\nVoice 5 \n“I lost my house. I have stolen. I have lied to people. I am now 40,000 pounds in debt. The low point was when I tried to kill myself. I was in hospital for three days. The pain of the addiction is with you as soon as you wake. I have nothing to live for. I am afraid of going food shopping in case I end up in a betting shop. I still want to go into betting shops. I am used to gambling 60 pounds. I could not go back to playing with five pounds. I would always be thinking “I should have gambled more!”\nVoice 1 \nDo you like to gamble? Do you think you may have a problem? You can decide with the help of a few questions like these:\nVoice 2 \nDo you gamble more money than you can lose? Do you try to win back money you have lost? Have you ever borrowed money to gamble? Have you sold something so you can gamble? Has anyone ever asked you to stop gambling? Do you ever feel bad about how your gambling affects people you love? If you answered yes to several of these questions, then you may have a problem with gambling.\nVoice 1 \nIf you want to stop gambling the best thing you can do is ask for help. There is hope! Programs and groups exist that can help. Look for a program in your community. If you cannot find one, visit the website gamblersanonymous.org and click the “international meetings” link. Remember that no matter how bad you may feel about your problem, you are not alone.\nVoice 2 \nDo you think gambling is just fun? Or should it be illegal everywhere? Tell us what you think.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Robin Basselin.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3 \n“You know a child is growing older when he stops asking where he came from. And he starts refusing to tell where he is going”.\nVoice 4 \n“Younger children are a pain in the head; older children are a pain in the heart”.\nVoice 3 \n“Teenagers say that there is nothing to do. Then they stay out all night doing it”.\nVoice 1 \nThese sayings about teenagers are supposed to be funny. But they are often true! Being a teenager can be exciting. But the teenage years can also be difficult. David Dobbs wrote about teenage behavior in National Geographic Magazine. He told this story about his own son:\nVoice 5 \n“One fine morning in May, my 17-year-old son called me. He told me that he had just spent a few hours with the state police. He said he had been driving ‘a little fast.’ What, I asked, was ‘a little fast’?  He had been driving down the road at over 180 kilometres an hour. I said ‘That’s more than a little fast!’\nImage by Karl Allen Lugmayer from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nMany other parents have similar stories to tell about their own teenagers. Teenagers often take risks, try new things and spend time with friends. But this behavior is more than just fun.  Some experts believe that this is how teenagers learn to become successful adults. Today’s Spotlight is on teenage behavior.\nVoice 1 \nA child enters her teenage years at about age 12. During this time her body and brain change. Her teenage years last until about age 20. During these teenage years, there are some behaviors that are very common. For example, teenagers often stay out late at night. Their emotions and ideas change quickly. And they often disagree with their parents.\nVoice 2 \nIn the past, scientists have asked why teenagers have these “problems”. But David Dobbs explains that scientists have found a new way to look at teenage behavior. They have found that teenagers are doing exactly the right thing. They are getting ready to move from the safety of home into the outside world.\nVoice 1 \nAdults have much more responsibility than children. A teenager must learn to be independent. He must learn to make good choices. He will soon leave his parents’ house. He must be able to survive alone. David Dobbs tells the radio organization NPR:\nVoice 5 \n“The hardest thing we ever do is leave home. It is a real test. So the reasons not to do it are very strong. Look at the things that are particular to teenagers in almost all cultures – risk, seeking new experience and wanting to be with people their own age. That is the perfect mix of things to push you if you are 14 or 18 years old. These things make you get out and explore the world. It’s hard to do, and the risk is very great. But you have to be able to take risks at that time of your life.”\nVoice 2 \nScientists have found three main behaviors that help teenagers achieve independence. First, teenagers often take risks. Remember the story of the 17-year-old-boy who was driving 180 kilometres an hour? He is not the only teenager to take this kind of risk.\nVoice 1 \nRisks can lead to danger. But learning to take some risks can be good for teenagers. Through human history, many people who took risks gained something good. Abigail Baird is a psychologist who studies teenagers. She says that a teenager who takes more risks and seeks new experiences does better as an adult.\nVoice 2 \nPeople often gain something when they take a risk. They may gain a new relationship or more respect from other people. But experts say that teenagers feel very strongly that they have something to gain. They value taking risks more than adults do. And they are more likely to take risks in front of other teenagers. In this way, they gain acceptance from other teenagers.\nVoice 1 \nThe second way teenagers learn independence is by seeking out new experiences.  These new experiences may be activities like playing sports. Or they could be unhealthy activities such as smoking cigarettes. The new experience could even be something that is against the law – like destroying property. David Dobbs writes in National Geographic Magazine:\nVoice 5 \n“Seeking new experience can lead to dangerous behavior. But it can also produce positive behavior – like the urge to meet more people, for example. This can create a wider circle of friends. This often makes us healthier, happier, safer, and more successful.”\nVoice 2 \nLike taking risks, experience usually leads a teenager to become a more successful adult. Adults must face many new experiences. Teenagers who have had new experiences – both good and bad – are more prepared. It is easier for them to deal with changes as adults.\nImage by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nAnd it is this desire for new experience that pushes the teenager. She goes out to try new things. As an adult she will have to leave the safety of her parent’s home. So as a teenager she gains experience that she will need as an adult.\nVoice 2 \nThere is a third and last behavior that helps teenagers gain independence and become adults. Teenagers like to be around people of their own age. Their friends are very important. They are learning the skills of surviving in a community. David Dobbs explains this also:\nVoice 5 \n“Teens want to be around people in their age group for a powerful reason. They want to invest in the future instead of the past. We enter a world made by our parents. But we will live most of our lives in a world run by people our own age. Knowing, understanding, and building relationships with them is very important for success.”\nVoice 1 \nAdults need to have good relationships with their communities. This is important for feeling peaceful and happy. But it is also important for a person to survive. That is one reason why teenagers are influenced by their friends. They are preparing to be social adults in their communities.\nVoice 2 \nSo there are good reasons for teenagers to take risks, try new things and spend time with friends. Knowing this does not make the teenage years easier. Teenagers will still make mistakes. But hopefully their teenage behavior will help them to become successful adults.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam. The voices you heard were from the United States.

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nWhen was the last time you used a pen or pencil? Did you write a list of things to do? Did you sign your name on a legal document? Did you draw a picture? Other than that, a lot of your writing was probably on a computer or smartphone. A small British survey in 2014 found that on average, people had not used a pen or pencil to write in 41 days!\nVoice 2  \nPeople write on paper much less than they used to. But is this a good or a bad thing? How is this change affecting people? Today’s Spotlight is on the end of handwriting.\nVoice 1  \nPeople have been writing for thousands of years. Writing began with making marks on a flat surface like a rock or clay stone. This took a lot of effort. It lasted for a long time. Then people began to use paper and liquid ink to mark the surface. When this happened, it was easier to write and send messages far away. But it was also easier to lose or destroy writing. Then pages of paper were collected in the first book. So, people could write more. Ballpoint pens let people write faster and more neatly. In fact, the whole history of writing is really people’s attempt to find ways to write faster and more clearly. In this way, computers and smartphones are just another step forward in writing.\nVoice 2\nBut have people lost something important as they stop writing by hand? Many people think writing by hand is more interesting and personal than using a computer or phone. People write using interesting forms of letters and numbers. Each person’s style is a little different. In fact, writing can even be different based on your culture.\nVoice 1  \nImagine writing the English letter “t”. If English is your first language, you will most likely first write a line up and down. Then, you will make a line across, nearer to the top of the first line. However, if you are from a country like Japan, China, or Taiwan, you will probably use a different method to make an English “t”. It is common for people there to make the line across first. Then, they will make the line up and down. The line across will be closer to the middle. Adrienne Bernhard believes this difference in writing gets lost in typing. She wrote for the BBC,\nVoice 3  \n“Text messaging has added to handwriting’s increasing sameness. Print is boring. Handwriting is interesting. Computers cannot show changes a person has written in the text. There are no pictures drawn on the side of the page. There is none of a person’s special character shown in hand-lettered sentences.”\nVoice 2  \nWriting by hand can also help us learn. Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M. Oppenheimer are psychologists. They study people’s behaviors. They compared students who take notes on a computer with students who use a paper and pen. They found that students who wrote by hand better understood and remembered what they heard.\nVoice 1  \nOne reason for this may be that writing by hand is a simple act. A computer has other software programs. It can connect to the Internet. Students can easily find other things to do. They can visit a website or check social media. But, there is nothing they can do with paper and pen except listen to the teacher.\nImage by felixioncool from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nVirginia Berninger is a psychologist at the University of Washington. She studied children when they wrote and typed. She took pictures of their brains as they wrote. The children who wrote by hand were able to produce more words more quickly than children who typed. They expressed more ideas. Berninger found that children’s brains showed more activity while writing rather than typing. Handwriting improved the children’s ability to think.\nVoice 1  \nIt is because of this kind of research that the country of France continues to teach handwriting. In France, people see handwriting as an important part of French culture. But it is also an important part of the learning process. Viviane Bouysse is a French school official. She spoke to The Guardian,\nVoice 4  \n“For a long time we attached little importance to handwriting. But in 2000, we began to build on work in brain sciences. We understood that writing by hand was a key step in brain development. It is not just writing a letter. There is an element of dancing when we write. There is a kind of song in the message. This adds emotion to the text. After all, that is why emoticons were invented, to bring back a little emotion to text messages.”\nVoice 2  \nAnd yet there are many people who feel that the end of handwriting is no problem. They believe that typing on computers and phones is just one more step forward in technology. Anne Trubek is the author of The History and Uncertain Future of Handwriting. She wrote for the New York Times,\nVoice 5  \n“The changes of the digital age may be good for writers and writing. Students learn to type on the keyboard very quickly. So today’s young students may become better writers. Keyboards are a great help to students with some learning disabilities, as well as students with poor handwriting. These students are often marked lower than those who write clearly, no matter what they write.”\nImage by free stock photos from www.picjumbo.com from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nAnd it is important to remember that some studies on handwriting and brain development are not always as clear as reports about them may show. It is good to enjoy writing by hand. But we should not let our love for something blind us to the truth. Trubek continues,\nVoice 5  \n“People talk about the death of handwriting as if it is death of culture. But the goal of education is to prepare students to become successful, working adults. Typing on a computer is clearly more useful than handwriting. There are few places where handwriting is required. And there will be even fewer places by the time today’s children leave school.”\nVoice 2  \nWhat do you think? Is writing by hand important in your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nCourtney Carver lives in Utah, in the United States. In 2010, she was tired. She was trying to do too much. Then she had enough of being tired. She started a website called Be More with Less. On it, she wrote,\nVoice 3  \n“I worked too hard. I spent too much. And I slept too little. I spent much of my adult life tired, worried and sick. I always wanted more. I thought I needed more to be happy.”\nVoice 2  \nCarver decided to change her life. She began to live more simply. She sold many of her things. And she gave away other things. She became a minimalist. And she says she has never felt better.\nVoice 1  \nCarver is part of a group of minimalists in places all over the world. Minimalists try to live simple lives. They believe that things get in the way of what is important. Instead of having more things, they invest in relationships and experiences. Today’s Spotlight is on minimalism.\nVoice 2  \nMinimalism is the idea that people are happier living with fewer things. But it is not about giving away everything you own. And minimalism is not about seeing how little you can live with. Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus write, teach, and speak about minimalism. They run the website theminimalists.com. They describe minimalism as a tool. It helps a person get rid of the things they do not need, so that they can concentrate on what is important. On their website they say,\nVoice 4  \n“There is nothing wrong with owning things. Today’s problem is that we give too much meaning to our things. We often forget our health. We forget our relationships. We forget to keep learning. Do you want to own a car or a house? Great! Do you want to raise a family and have a job? If these things are important to you, wonderful. Minimalism lets you choose these with greater care.”\nVoice 1  \nMinimalism means different things to different people. But many minimalists agree on a few general ideas. First, love what you do own. As part of her minimalism Courtney Carver started Project 333. She encourages people to choose only 33 pieces of clothing including clothes, jewelry and shoes. Then they choose what to wear from these 33 things for three months.\nPhoto by tu tu\nVoice 2  \nDave Bruno is another minimalist. He started the 100 thing challenge. He reduced everything he owned to just 100 things.\nVoice 1  \nBoth of these projects ask people to think about what they own. If you have fewer things, you will love them more.\nVoice 2  \nThe next idea of minimalism is to get rid of the things that do not bring joy. Marie Kondo is a Japanese writer who helps people organize their homes. In 2016, she wrote a book called Spark Joy. She says her method is easy. Pick up an object in your home. If it gives you joy, keep it. If it does not, get rid of it. She says if you do this, you will always be surrounded by things that you love.\nVoice 1  \nThe third idea of minimalism is to spend time on relationships. Dan Erickson calls himself a moderate minimalist. He writes on the website hipdiggs.com. He says that when we live with less, we have more space for people. When we slow down our lives, we have time for relationships. When we watch less television or use the Internet less, we see what is around us.\nVoice 2  \nMinimalism looks different in different people. For example, many people choose to live in very small houses called tiny houses. They could pay for a large house. But they choose a small one. Some even build a house that is as small as a single room. A small house costs less money to build. It takes less time to clean. It costs less to heat and cool. This leaves more time and money for family and friends. However, a tiny house is good for one or two people. But it is difficult for a family to live in one.\nVoice 1  \nBut a family can still be minimalist. Joshua Becker believes that minimalism is great for children. He writes on his website, becomingminimalist.com that,\nVoice 4  \n“Children with fewer things learn how to develop relationships with other children and adults. They learn how to talk to other people. And studies show that children with good friendships have a greater chance of success in school. They also have more success in social situations as adults.”\nVoice 2  \nLiving with less can even be very exciting. Colin Wright is a writer who lives in a new place every four months. He can move from place to place because he has so little to move. And he lets his readers vote on where he should go next. He has travelled all over the world. He has been to Argentina, Iceland, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines.\nPhoto by Barbara Maier\nVoice 1  \nMinimalism may sound strange to people who are struggling to have enough food or a safe place to sleep. But people who practice minimalism say it is not just about the things people own. It is about people and relationships. It is about living the best life you can and choosing what is important. And minimalism is not a new idea. Many religions and ancient thinkers believe people should not worry too much about things. Buddhism encourages people to let go of the things they own. And Jesus once said,\nVoice 5  \n“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They do not work or make clothing. But here is what I tell you. Not even Solomon with all his money was dressed like one of these flowers.”\nVoice 2  \nLiving with less can change a person’s life. Courtney Carver spoke to Today.com. She explained,\nVoice 3  \n“I am more present and connected to my family than I was when I was working so hard. Now we all see that there is great opportunity for happiness in living with less. We live small so we can live big.”\nVoice 1  \nDo you think you would like to be a minimalist? Are there things you could never give up? Tell us what you think.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Anne Muir.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 3\n“My driver’s license came up for renewal. I needed to take a written test of the traffic laws. For days, I studied a little book of all the rules. My boyfriend David would try to persuade me to spend time with him. He wanted me to join him for a walk or to go to a party or even just to talk. I told him I could not take the time. Of course, I got perfect marks on the test. I ran to tell David. “My love,” he said, “why would you want to do that?” It was not the response I had expected. Suddenly I understood that I had sacrificed a great deal for a test that was not very important. I had spent days studying for it that I could have spent in much better ways.”\nVoice 1\nThis story is from Rachel Naomi Remen. She is from the United States. In that country, every driver must take a written test to get a driving license. But this test is not difficult. And the driver only needs to pass the test. A perfect result does not matter! Remen’s efforts to study were extreme – and unnecessary. This was a sign that Remen had a problem.\nVoice 2 \nToday, Remen is a doctor who studies human health and emotions. She also calls herself a “recovering perfectionist.” That means she used to be a perfectionist, but she is trying not to be one now. She tells the story of her driving test to show the problems of trying to be perfect. What is a perfectionist? Why was it so important to Remen to get a perfect result on her driving test? Today’s Spotlight is on being perfect.\nVoice 1\nPerfectionism is a very complex behaviour. It is part of a person’s character or personality. Perfectionists always try to do everything perfectly – without any mistakes, errors or faults. Some perfectionists may expect other people around them to be perfect too. On her website, Dr. Remen says:\nPhoto by Allef Vinicius\nVoice 3\n“Before I began recovering from perfectionism I felt that I was always falling short. And so was everyone else. Who we were and what we did was never quite good enough. I sat in judgment on life itself. Perfectionism is the belief that life is broken.”\nVoice 2 \nMany cultures place a high value on working to achieve perfect results. It can be good to always aim to be excellent. For example, some sports people may be perfectionists. They work hard for the best possible result. They try to perform perfectly in a competition. People also think the famous artist Michelangelo was a perfectionist. This quality probably helped him create his amazing works of art. Sometimes we even depend on the high expectations of perfectionists. For example, when a specialist is performing a surgery on our hearts, we would like it to be perfect.\nPhoto by Dries Augustyns\nVoice 1 \nBut perfectionism can often have negative results. Some people feel that they need to be perfect. They have very high expectations for themselves. Perfectionists measure their worth, or value, by how well they do everything. This kind of perfectionism can even become a mental disorder. Experts have identified three different kinds of perfectionism.\nVoice 2 \nThe first kind of perfectionism is based on the self. This is when a person requires himself to be perfect. Then, when he fails to do this, he is very disappointed. A man named Paul told his story about this kind of perfectionism to the Mental Health Foundation:\nVoice 4 \n“I had been trying to do too much, too well and trying to please too many people. I had been expecting too much of myself for too long and putting too much pressure on myself. I was creating too much stress. That is a lot of ‘too muches’ for one person. I stopped looking forward to anything. I felt like I was useless and hopeless.”\nVoice 1 \nAnother kind of perfectionist expects other people to be perfect. People in relationships with the perfectionist often feel that they are always being criticized. They may feel that they can never be good enough to be loved. Kathy Miller is a perfectionist. She gives a small example of how her husband was never perfect enough for her:\nVoice 5 \n“One night I returned home from shopping. My husband, met me at the door, smiling. He led me into the kitchen and announced, “I washed the dishes for you!” As I put my arms around him and said, “Thank you!” I looked over his shoulder. I noticed pieces of food and drops of liquid on the table. “But you have not cleaned the table!” I thought. “You have not finished the job!”\nVoice 2 \nA third kind of perfectionism relates to social conditions. This kind of perfectionist believes that other people expect her to be perfect. This kind of perfectionism often begins when children have very demanding parents. Doctor Randy Frost has studied perfectionism for many years. He tells the magazine Psychology Today:\nPhoto by Icons8 Team \nVoice 6 \n“Overly demanding and judgemental parents put a lot of pressure on children to achieve. Our studies show that is connected to perfectionism. Sometimes the parent is happy only when the child achieves something or spends a lot of time working at something. The parent’s high expectations are not spoken out loud but they are made clear by the environment.”\nVoice 1 \nAll three of these kinds of perfectionism can have negative effects. Perfectionism can lead to other emotional problems such as depression, using too much alcohol or other drugs, eating disorders or even suicide. Perfectionism can also be connected to other physical problems such as stress problems and heart conditions. However, there are many ways to reduce the need to be perfect. Ann Smith wrote a book called “Overcoming Perfectionism.” She gives some good ideas about having healthier expectations:\nVoice 7 \n“The change starts with acknowledging our humanness. We learn to accept the best and worst of who we are. Some things about us will never change. Other parts of ourselves may be altered by life experiences. In the meantime, you are good enough for today – perfectly imperfect.”\nVoice 2 \nIt is not easy to stop being a perfectionist. Remember Kathy Miller who was not happy with her husband, even when he was helping her? She says that she is trying not to expect perfection. Her Christian faith has helped her to accept her husband, and herself. Miller writes:\nVoice 5 \n“Giving myself grace has been a slow growth process. But I believe that God understands our mistakes. And he is willing to forgive them. We can stop expecting too much from ourselves and others.  You and I are already perfect in God’s sight. We have nothing to prove. We are accepted.”\nVoice 1 \nThe writers of this program were Marina Santee and Rena Dam. The producer was Rena Dam. The voices you heard were from the United States and the United Kingdom.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nWhat is happiness? Are you happy? What makes you happy? For thousands of years people all over the world have discussed these questions and expressed different opinions. We begin today’s programme with some of their thoughts.\nVoice 2  \nAristotle was a great thinker who lived in Greece over 2,000 years ago. He said,\nVoice 3  \n‘Happiness depends on ourselves.’\nVoice 1  \nThucydides also lived in Greece at about the same time. He was a military man who studied history. He said,\nVoice 3  \n‘The secret of happiness is freedom. And the secret of freedom is courage.\nVoice 2  \nWilliam Gladstone was the prime minister of the United Kingdom in the 19th century. He said,\nVoice 3  \n‘Be happy with what you have and are. Be open-handed with both, and you will not have to hunt for happiness.’\nVoice 1  \nCharles Spurgeon also lived in the United Kingdom at about the same time. He was a religious speaker. And he said,\nVoice 3  \n‘It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness.’\nVoice 2  \nToday’s Spotlight is on happiness.\nPhoto by Huyen Nguyen\nVoice 1  \nPeople all around the world think that happiness is important. In 2012 the United Nations even passed a resolution about happiness. All 193 member states agreed to the resolution. They recognised happiness as a global human goal. And they decided to make the 20th of March the International Day of Happiness.\nVoice 2  \nOn the 20th of March 2015 the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, wrote a special message. In it he said,\nVoice 7  \n‘I wish everyone around the world a very happy International Day of Happiness! The search for happiness is a serious business. Happiness for the whole human family is one of the main goals of the United Nations. Peace, plenty, lives of respect for all – this is what we seek. We want all men, women and children to enjoy all their human rights. We want all countries to know the joy of peace. We want both people and planet to be blessed with lasting development, and to be free of the terrible effects of climate change. Let us give thanks for what makes us happy. And let us give our efforts to filling our world with happiness.’\nVoice 1  \nBut what makes people happy? Many people think that happiness depends on being rich and beautiful. But scientists and experts have studied happiness. They know this is not correct. Good and bad things happen to everyone. Many scientists and experts believe that happiness is something we can choose. They believe that happiness is not always about what happens to you. They believe that much happiness is about how you choose to react. You can choose to react to events in your life in a positive way. Dr. Amit Sood is an expert at the Mayo Clinic in the United States. He said,\nVoice 8  \n‘Happiness is a habit or custom. Some of us are born happy. But most others have to choose it. We often, however, do not understand we have that choice. We also do not know how to exercise that choice. As a result we push happiness away. Do not let that not happen to you.’\nVoice 2  \nSo how can we choose to be happy? What do we need to do? Experts have a lot of different advice. But they agree that gratitude or being thankful is very important. You will learn to be happy or happier by being thankful.\nVoice 1  \nDr Robert Emmons is a leading expert on gratitude. He suggests many ways to become more thankful. One method he suggests is keeping a gratitude journal or book. Every day, write down things for which you are thankful. These things may be about you, events or people. He also suggests that you use the language of thankful people. You can use words like gifts, givers, blessings, blessed.\nVoice 2  \nWhat things are people most grateful for? BUPA is a health organisation in the United Kingdom. BUPA did some research about the things that make people feel happy. They found that many small and simple things make people feel good. For example, sleeping in a clean, fresh bed. Another example: many people enjoy feeling the sun on their faces. Other people feel good when someone is kind to them.  Other people like laughing so hard it hurts or smelling freshly made bread.\nPhoto by Frank Busch\nVoice 1  \nSome people find that music makes them feel happy. Pharrell Williams writes and performs music. He said that that music brought him happiness. He even wrote a song called ‘Happy’.\n[excerpt of the song “Happy”]\nIt is a very joyful song. People around the world have enjoyed watching it. They have watched the song more than 750 million times on YouTube. And many people have even made their own versions of it. Williams told the BBC why he wrote the song.\nVoice 9  \n‘The purpose of the song was to make everyone remember that you have a basic freedom to find happiness.’\nVoice 2  \nEven the United Nations knows that music can make people happy. And in 2015 the United Nations celebrated the International Day of Happiness with music. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, asked people all over the world to share a song that makes them happy.\nVoice 1  \nMany famous people shared songs that represented happiness and made them smile. They helped to create the world’s happiest playlist. The actor Michael Douglas chose the song ‘Zip a Dee Doo Dah’. The singer James Blunt chose the song ‘We are Young’.\nVoice 2  \nPharrell Williams attended the United Nations event that launched the playlist. He told everyone that protecting our planet is necessary for human happiness. He also urged everyone to find out what makes them happy, \nVoice 9  \n‘It can be something as detailed as a long term goal. Or it could be something as simple as the way I feel when my son smiles. You should know that happiness is your right. It is a reaction to something, or someone, or a time.’\nVoice 1  \nAre you happy? What makes you happy? What are you thankful for?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA woman drives a black convertible over a hill. Her hair flows behind her out of this open-roofed vehicle. At the top of the hill, the road bends around sharp rocks. The sea crashes below. And, out above the sea, the sun begins to set. The woman parks her car and looks out over the ocean. The engine of her electric-powered car is quiet. Its sound disappears into the wind.\nVoice2\nCars are everywhere. They take people to remote places. They take people to work and to their homes. Usually, these automobiles are powered by gasoline or petrol. But things were not always this way, and they may not always be either.\nToday’s Spotlight is on the history and future of the automobile.\nVoice 1\nPeople have dreamed about creating cars for a very long time. They wanted a way to transport people and goods without animals. But it took a very long time to make one that worked.\nVoice2\nNicholas Cugnot was a French inventor. He built the first car in the late 1700’s. It used steam to power its engines. And it could drive at speeds of about 7 kilometres per hour. But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use. But cars did not become popular until someone invented a different kind of engine.\nVoice 1\nThe engine that powers many of the cars you see on the road today is called an internal combustion engine. Many people helped to create the internal combustion engine. But the first person to use it in a car was Karl Benz, in 1885. Internal combustion engines are smaller than steam engines. They use gasoline to fuel the engine. And they can produce more power to push a car faster.\nVoice2\nThis new engine made cars more popular around the world. But for a long time, only the very wealthy could buy them. Cars cost a lot of money because of the way people made them. One or two people made each car by hand. So cars took a long time to make. Also, each car was different so they cost a lot of money to fix.\nVoice 1\nBut in the early 1900s a man from the United States changed how cars were made. His name was Henry Ford.  Ford was a car engineer. At first, he made cars the traditional way. But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.\nVoice2\nFord’s method changed the way industry works around the world. He designed a system that made it easy to produce large amounts of his product. He paid his workers enough money so that they could buy his product. Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars. Many other car companies also used Ford’s methods. Cars began to cost less money all over the world.\nVoice 1\nBut the number of cars on the road also created a problem. Every car needed gasoline for fuel. Burning gasoline worked very well to power cars. But it also creates a lot of  pollution. The number of cars made some cities difficult to live in. People exposed to too much vehicle pollution develop problems with their breathing.\nVoice2\nBurning gasoline also creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that leads to global climate change. Using gasoline was a great idea when people started making cars. There were not many cars in the beginning, so the pollution did not affect much. But today there are more than one and a half billion cars on the road. The success of the car has turned gasoline use into a danger.\nVoice 1\nKate Brunton is a representative from Amber. Amber is a Dutch car company that makes electric, self-driving vehicles. She spoke to the University Network about the problem of gasoline cars.\nVoice 3\n“The problem is that owning cars, especially cars that use fuel, is bad. But there is no real choice. It is bad for consumers, because the cost of owning most cars is high. It is bad for the environment. It does not work well. Most cars spend 90 percent of their time standing still.”\nVoice2\nToday many car companies are working to make cars that do not need gasoline. For example, many large vehicle manufacturers have begun to produce electric vehicles. Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!\nVoice 1\nAnother newer creation is the hybrid vehicle. Hybrid cars use technology from both gasoline and electric engines. Hybrids have gasoline engines like normal cars. But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines. And they require less gasoline to operate.\nVoice2\nOther companies have been experimenting with different fuels. For example, it is possible to fuel a car with hydrogen. Many large car companies are researching this new technology. Right now, it is difficult to use hydrogen because it does not last very long. One tank full of hydrogen may only be able to fuel a car for a very short time. But people are hopeful that new technologies will help make hydrogen work in the future.\nVoice 1\nThere are many possible paths for the future of the car. How we travel has changed many times over the past hundred years. And it will change again. It may be possible that there will be no single replacement for the internal combustion engine. In the future, there may be many different kinds of cars, each with different fuels. Or people may use cars less.  Either way, it is important to continue to invest in these new technologies. It is important not only for the future of the car, but for the future of humanity.\nVoice2\nDo you own a car? What kind of engine does it have? Do you use busses or trains more often?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.\nVoice 2\nIf you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.\nVoice 1\nBees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.\nVoice 2\nBees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.\nVoice 1\nBut to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!\nVoice 2\nIt takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.\nVoice 1\nThe day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.\nVoice 2\nWhen the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:\nVoice 3\n“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”\nVoice 1\nThe hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.\nVoice 2\nBut this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation is a local organization in Southern India. It has worked with the honey hunters for fifteen years. They aim to protect the environment and local culture. Robert Leo works for the Keystone Foundation. He tells the organization Slow Food International:\nVoice 4\n“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”\nVoice 2\nMany young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Lots of people say – how can you work out in the wild when you are a woman? But I can do anything I want.  Many other people, especially young women like us, they want to join us. I am a woman. I am going to have a baby. I want my baby to see a rhino. That is why I am protecting it.”\nVoice 1\nLeitah Michabela said this to The Guardian newspaper. Michabela is part of a group in South Africa called The Back Mambas. They work to protect wild animals, particularly one special animal – the rhinoceros, or rhino. Today’s Spotight is on The Black Mambas of South Africa.\nVoice 2\nSouth Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.\nVoice 1\nRhinos are protected by the laws of the country. But people still hunt them. Some people think that the rhino horn has special powers. They will pay a lot of money for it. Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.\nVoice 2\nIn Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.\nVoice 1\nBut even with punishments and armed rangers, the rate of rhino deaths in Kruger Park was still very high. Authorities needed another solution to save the rhinos. So they formed a new group in a nearby area called Balule Nature Reserve. This group has reduced trapping and poaching in their area by 76 percent!\nVoice 2\nThis new force is made up only of women. They are named the Black Mambas after a deadly kind of snake. The Black Mambas do not carry guns. Instead they concentrate on protecting the animals and natural environment in the Park. Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Black Mambas. She explains to The Guardian why her group is so important.\nVoice 4\n“There were men rangers carrying guns. But still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached.\nI think they said, ‘Let us start something and add women and see what happens.’ Women are more loyal to their jobs. So they feel very strongly about what they do.”  \nVoice 1\nIn 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.\nVoice 2\nSince 2013, the Mambas have patrolled the metal fence which marks the Park area. They watch for poachers. They remove traps, or snares, set by poachers. And they report everything they see. The Mambas also go into the community. There, they educate people, especially children, about protecting animals.\nVoice 1\nAnd the women of the Black Mambas have made a big difference. The Guardian says in the six months before they began, 16 rhinos were killed in Balule. In the year after the Black Mambas started, only three rhinos were killed. Siphiwe Sithole says:\nVoice 4\n“The Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching. We have zero acceptance of rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”\nVoice 2\nPeople all over the world have noticed the Black Mambas’ success. The New York Times published pictures of them. They won an award from the UK organization Helping Rhinos. And the UN gave them the Champions of the Earth prize in 2015 for their courage. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Achim Steiner said:\nVoice 5\n“Their many successes are a result of their great courage and strong desire to make a difference in their community. The Black Mambas are an inspiration, not only locally, but across the world to all those working to stop the ugliness of the illegal wildlife trade.”\nVoice 1\nWinning awards like this shows people that it is possible to prevent poaching. It also shows local people that the Black Mambas are valuable. Mamba Felicia Mogakane explains:\nVoice 6\n“It is about knowing that people in South Africa love and are thankful fo what we are doing. They are so happy that there are Mambas. Some years ago, they used to say this job is for men. Now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job. Jobs are limited in South Africa. So this is a big chance for me because I am able to take care of my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe Black Mambas are doing important work to save rhinos. But they are also doing important work in their communities. They are supporting their families by earning money. And people respect and honour them because of the work that they do. The Black Mambas show that communities and nature can work together. They bring hope for both people and animals in South Africa. We close our program today with the words of another Mamba, Collette Ngobeni, who share her hope for the future:\nVoice 7\n“If we work together as a community, we can solve this problem. People need to open their minds and their hearts. It is not about money. It is about our culture, our future.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1      \nIt is January 2005. A man named Lawrence Summers was speaking at a conference. The conference was about women who work in science and engineering jobs. These kinds of jobs are called STEM jobs. STEM is the first letter of science, technology, engineering and math. It is a well-known fact that most of the people who work in STEM jobs are men.\nVoice 2      \nAt the time of the conference, Summers was president of the famous Harvard University. His words made a lot of people very angry. Summers claimed that men were more highly skilled in math and science. He said that people should consider that genetics could be the reason more men than women are in STEM work. Some people were so angry at this comment that they walked out of the conference! The next day, media around the world were talking about Lawrence Summers’ comments. It is true that fewer women than men have STEM work. But is genetics the reason? Could it be culture, or history? Are women able to be as good at STEM jobs as men? Today’s Spotlight is on women and STEM careers.\nVoice 1 \nAlmost every part of modern life involves technology and science. The global economy needs more and more people working in STEM jobs. The UN reports:\nVoice 3 \n“New ideas and improvements in STEM are very important. They are able to help achieve long-term development and the end of poverty.”\nVoice 2 \nThe UN reports that in the area of engineering, men are the majority in almost every country. They also report low global percentages of women studying computer science. The Elsevier Foundation is an international organization that supports women in STEM jobs. The foundation did research in countries in some of the world’s largest economies. These included the US, Korea, India, and Europe. They found that less than 30% of women study STEM subjects. However, the problem is even more serious. In some countries, women are studying STEM subjects. But they do not take jobs in science, technology, engineering and math. Sophia Huyer is the Executive Director of the international organization Women in Global Science and Technology. She told the US News and World Report,\nVoice 4\n“Being able to get an education is not a solution all on its own.”\nVoice 1 \nWomen are half of the global work force. But less and less women are going into STEM jobs. Many different theories exist about why more men are in STEM careers. One of the most common is that women are less skilled in science, technology, engineering and math. Many people believe this. But Jo Boaler disagrees. Boaler is a math education professor at Stanford University. She told Stanford Press,\nVoice 5 \n“There is a huge belief that boys are better at math. This does not agree with the information we have. And yet people believe it. You go into schools and the children will tell you that.”\nVoice 2 \nPeople also think that women do not choose STEM careers because of marriage and children. They say that STEM jobs are more demanding and difficult for people with family responsibilities. Often STEM jobs involve big projects. Employers commonly expect workers to leave behind everything else until the project is finished – even if they have to work in the middle of the night. Lawrence Summers also talked about this in his comments about why fewer women work in STEM. He said,\nVoice 6 \n“The best reason I can give is the general conflict between people’s family desires and employers’ desires for high power and high intensity.”\nVoice 1 \nAlso, many women say that they do not try to get STEM jobs because other people discourage them. Jennifer Selvidge is a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the top schools for studying STEM subjects. She wrote in a Huffington Post blog,\nVoice 7 \n“I am an engineer, an honours student, and a woman. People have also told me hundreds of times that I do not deserve to be where I am.”\nVoice 2 \nMany people believe that it is not fair that women do not have an equal chance to work in STEM jobs. So people around the world are trying to get more women into STEM careers. One way is by celebrating the achievement and raising the recognition of women in STEM careers. For example, the Elsevier Awards are given out by the World Academy of Sciences, the Elsevier Foundation, and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World. These awards go to women in science from the developing world.\nVoice 1 \nEqbal Mohammed Abdu Dauqan is one Elsevier Award winner. Dauqan is from Yemen. She is the head of the medical laboratory science department at the Al-Saeed University in Taizz, Yemen. Dauqan told the Foundation,\nVoice 8 \n“My father is in engineering. My mother is a house-wife. But she was pushing me to finish my studies. My older sister is a doctor in geographic science. One cousin is an engineer.”\nVoice 2 \nElsevier award winners come from all over the world. But one thing that many of them share is a strong system of support. The women scientists say that they have support from husbands, children, parents, and extended families. David Ruth is the Executive Director of the Elsevier Foundation. He told US News and World Report,\nVoice 9 \n“You see a lot of women coming to get this award with their families. They have a support network. In parts of the world where gender is more of an issue, it takes more than one individual to be able to succeed.”\nVoice 1 \nWomen like Eqbal Mohammed Abdu Dauqan show that women can be very good at STEM careers. And more women are getting support from organizations like the Elsevier foundation. Hopefully this will result in more women in STEM jobs around the world. This would provide more equal employment for women. And it would help their families and communities.\nVoice 2      \nBut it would also help science and technology. Women often have a different viewpoint and experience than men. They bring important skills to the STEM subjects. Maybe, with more women in STEM jobs, these quickly growing areas would improve even more!\nVoice 1      \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nWould you attach magnets to your head so you could wear glasses? \nVoice 2\nWould you buy beef flavoured water for your dog?\nVoice 1\nWould you buy a golf club that you could use as a toilet? \nVoice 2\nAll of these are failed ideas. Someone thought of them, and someone else paid to make them. But they all failed. Many even seem like jokes. But these are the kinds of real products you will find at the Museum of Failure. \nVoice 1\nThe Museum of Failure takes its display of failed products from place to place. When you visit, you will see of some of the world’s most wonderful, and stupid, inventions ever sold. But the Museum of Failure is not only there so you can laugh at failed products. It also shows how very successful companies often fail – even companies like Apple, Amazon, and Twitter. And you can see how these companies learned from their mistakes. Today’s Spotlight is on the Museum of Failure.\nVoice 2\nDr. Samuel West is a psychologist. He studies corporate behaviour – how and why large companies act the way that they do. He noticed that people do not like to talk about their failures. They cause us shame. But Dr. West believes that failures are important. Failure often leads to success. And, to make something new, it is often necessary to fail. Doctor West started the Museum of Failure so that people could talk about failure more openly. He spoke to the PBS News, about creating the Museum of Failure.\nVoice 3\n“If you explore new methods, new products, and technology, you will probably fail. In fact, ninety percent of new projects fail. This is the real obstacle to change. People are afraid of failing. I was thinking: “what can I do to communicate that we need to start accepting failure, rather than fear it?”\nVoice 1\nSo, Dr. West began gathering failed products and telling their stories. At first, his collection was small. But soon, he gathered over 150 examples of failure. And he opened a museum in Sweden to display them.\nVoice 2\nSome products in the Museum of Failure are just funny. Take for example, the Rejuvenique. The Rejuvenique was a plastic face mask with electrodes inside it. When you put it on, the mask would send small electric shocks onto different parts of your face. Its inventors claimed that the shocks from the mask would make people look younger. But wearing the mask hurt. The mask looked very strange. And there was no evidence that it worked. The product failed soon after its release.\nVoice 1\nThis product seems like a bad idea from the beginning. But it does show the importance of trying. Many people have better ideas than the Rejuvenique mask. But they do not act on them out of fear. The Rejuvinique mask shows that making something new is easier than you think. If someone can fail as badly as this, the risk you are taking does not seem as terrible.\nVoice 2\nSometimes, though, these failures can have terrible consequences. One of the most important failures at the Museum of Failure is thalidomide. Thalidomide is a drug invented in the early nineteen fifties. Today, doctors use it to treat cancer and leprosy. But thalidomide has a dark history. When it was first released, its creators said it was a wonder drug. It helped people sleep. It treated anxiety and worry. It even helped with morning sickness, an illness that sometimes happens during pregnancy. Thalidomide was very popular, and it was supposed to be safe. In some countries, you could even get it without a note from a doctor.\nVoice 1\nBut the makers of thalidomide did not test it well. Or they ignored their tests. Thalidomide was safe for adults. But if a pregnant woman took it, the drug hurt the baby. Thalidomide causes serious birth defects in early pregnancy. It can damage a baby’s brain, its eyes, and its arms and legs. Many thalidomide babies were born with very short arms and legs. Many died. Doctors no longer give thalidomide during pregnancy. But over 24,000 children were hurt after the drug was released.\nVoice 2\nThalidomide was one of the greatest disasters in medical history. But its failure did have some positive effects. Before thalidomide, companies did not have to report the results from all of their tests. There were fewer rules for what they had to test. After the thalidomide disaster, countries forced drug makers to test in more ways. Thalidomide hurt many, many people. But it also made the drugs we take today safer.\nVoice 1\nSome of the products at the Museum of Failure show that failure can even be the secret to success. Teflon is a chemical used in many different products. It makes surfaces very slippery. Nothing gets stuck to Teflon. So, people use it in non-stick cooking pans. It does not let electricity pass through it. A lot of electronic devices have Teflon in them. People also use it in electrical  wiring. And it can also make fabric resistant to stains and water.\nVoice 2\nBut the creation of Teflon was an accident. Roy Plunkett was the chemist who created Teflon. He worked for the American company DuPont. He was trying to mix different chemicals. One night, he left some of these chemicals in a very cold environment. But, when he came to work the next morning, the chemical had changed. Instead of being a liquid, it had turned into a white powder. And Plunkett had no idea what it was.\nVoice 1\nPlunkett could have ignored the material. He could have thrown it away. But, instead, he decided to test the material. He spent six months trying to understand what it was. And interest in the chemical began to grow. Soon, Du Pont was making millions of kilograms of Teflon each year. Plunkett had made a mistake. But he was able to turn his mistake into great success.\nVoice 2\nFor Dr. West and the Museum of Failure, all of these failures are not just interesting stories. They teach us how to deal with our own failures. They can help us do better at our jobs. And they can make us better people. He writes about this on the Museum of Failure webpage:\nVoice 3\n“The museum’s goal is to say, “Hey, let us not forget these failures. Let’s put them on display. Let us shine a spotlight on these failures. Then, we can talk about them. Then, we can learn from them.”\nVoice 1\nDo you remember a time when you failed at something? What did you learn from it?

People may give flowers to say, ‘Happy Birthday’, ‘Thank You’ or ‘I love you’.     \nVoice 2  \nSome people who give flowers get them from their own land or fields.

Experts estimate that this global trade is worth more than 100 billion dollars every year.                                 \nVoice 1  \nFor many years countries in Western Europe led the cut flower industry. The Netherlands was the centre of the industry. It was the major producer of cut flowers. It was the most important cut flower trading nation. Today the Netherlands is still the largest exporter of cut flowers in the world. But there have been changes in the last 20 years. Developing countries have successfully entered the flower industry. They have even reduced the Netherlands’ global share of exports. Countries such as Kenya, Colombia and Ecuador are new centres of production.\nVoice 2  \nSo which countries buy all of these flowers? People in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the world’s biggest buyers of cut flowers. Many of the flowers they buy are imported. For example, 82% of cut flowers sold in the United States have been imported. The United States gets most its flowers from Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Europe imports many of its flowers from countries in Africa like Kenya.\nVoice 1  \nDeveloping countries like Ecuador, Colombia and Kenya are successful in the cut flower industry. These countries even have some advantages over countries in Western Europe. They have much better climates for producing flowers like roses. The temperature is warm all year. And labour costs less too. Flower farms use a lot of labour to grow flowers. So many people are able to work and earn money in the industry.\nVoice 2  \nNathalie Cely was the Ambassador of Ecuador to the United States. In the Huffington Post she explained that the flower industry is very important.\nVoice 3 \n‘One out of every four roses bought in the United States comes from Ecuador. The rose industry in Ecuador provides good paying jobs for thousands of poor country women. Many of these women are heads of families.’\nRose in Ecuador; Image by David Espinoza from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nBut countries like Ecuador, Colombia and Kenya are thousands of kilometres away from their European and North American markets. And cut flowers have a limited life. Workers must treat them with great care. They control the temperature and air quality around the flowers. The flowers must reach their market quickly. If this does not happen they will be ruined or die. So flower farmers use airplanes to fly their flowers to market. Jane Ngige is the Chief Executive of the Kenyan Flower Council. She told CNN that being able to fly flowers to their market is very important.\nVoice 4  \n‘A direct flight to the market is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to promise quality.’\nVoice 2  \nHowever, flying flowers around the world uses a lot of energy. This produces carbon. Some people may be concerned that this is not good for the environment and climate change. But others are not worried. Hilary Benn was the United Kingdom’s International Development Secretary. In 2013 he told a conference that flying flowers around the world used less energy than growing flowers in Europe.\nVoice 5  \n‘People often do not understand that they can support developing countries and reduce the release of carbon. Recent research shows that flowers flown from Africa can use less energy overall than those produced in Europe. This is because they are not grown in heated glass houses.’\nVoice 1  \nSome people raised another concern about flowers produced in developing countries. In some places there were problems for flower workers. They worked in poor conditions. Sometimes they worked long hours with no rest periods. They were paid low wages. Farmers did not protect workers from chemicals used. However in recent years working conditions have improved on flower farms in many countries. And hundreds of flower farms have become fair trade farms.\nVoice 2  \nFair trade organisations decide if a farm meets the fair trade quality. On fair trade farms workers receive better wages. And they have safe working conditions. Fair trade flowers cost buyers about 10% more money. This extra money is called the ‘social premium’. It is controlled by groups of local workers.\nVoice 1  \nThe workers use the social premium money to pay for community projects. Each local project is different. But all improve quality of life. Education projects provide equipment, classes and toilets for schools. Parents get help to pay the cost of sending their children to school and university. Carlota Garcia works on a flower farm in Ecuador. She told the organisation Fair Trade USA how she was helped,\nVoice 6  \n‘Thanks to this programme, I was able to keep my children in school and give them everything they need to study: clothes, joining costs, school supplies.’\nImage by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nOther social premium projects help workers buy their homes. Health projects prevent diseases such as malaria and cholera. Environmental projects include green energy and tree planting. Samuel Atieno lives near the Athi River in Kenya. He led one social premium workers group. He told the organisation Fairtrade Foundation of his experience and big hopes for the future,\nVoice 7 \n‘Fair trade is a life changer. If this premium money can change the life of a worker in such a short time; if it can turn around the life of a family, of a community; then can’t this premium also change the structure of the country? In the long run we will affect Kenya and then even Africa.’\nVoice 1  \nDo you buy flowers? Would you buy fair trade flowers? What do you think about flying flowers around the world?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nYunzhe Zhou is a job coach. She helps people who are tired of their jobs and need a change. She tells people to try and connect with something that makes them excited and gives them energy. She spoke to the magazine Fast Company:\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 3 \n“If you are giving 1000% percent at your current job, and you still feel like something is missing, it is a good sign that it may not be the right direction.”\nVoice 2 \nBut it is not always easy to find the right direction. This is why one ancient idea is becoming popular again: the sabbatical. This time away from work can bring ideas, energy, and a new direction. Today’s Spotlight is on sabbaticals.\nVoice 1 \nThe idea of a Sabbatical began with the ancient Hebrew law called Sabbath. Traditionally, Jewish people believe that God created the world in six days. On the seventh day, God rested. They believe that God created people to work for six days and then rest for one day. Yet, sabbaticals are no longer just a religious idea. Experts around the world agree that resting from work is good for all people.\nVoice 2 \nA sabbatical is not a vacation. A vacation is a time away from work to rest, travel, or spend time with people we love. But a sabbatical is different. Traditionally, a sabbatical is a year off work to travel or study. A person may or may not receive payment for this year. The company Remote Year helps people travel the world while still working over the Internet. They explained sabbaticals on the company website:\nVoice 4 \n“Sabbaticals are not defined by the lack of work. They are defined by the presence of work. People who are taking sabbaticals today are not taking time off from work for relaxation. They are following another kind of personal or professional work. They are using this time to follow their dreams. They may work to create something that they have been dreaming about for years. They are using it to do a project that they have not been able to work on for years.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe most common place where people take sabbatical is in university. Usually, a professor gets a sabbatical every seven years. A professor on sabbatical does not have to teach students or meet with other professors. But that does not mean they do nothing. Many professors travel to a new country. Others write a book. Some finish  a research project. Many professors return with new energy and new ideas. The sabbatical is good for the school, the students, and the professor.\nVoice 2 \nIn recent years, many businesses noticed that it was not working well to ask people to work more and more. These companies began to offer workers a sabbatical. Two major businesses that offer sabbatical options are McDonald’s and Nike. Some banks and law and accounting firms offer them too. Some companies require a person on sabbatical to volunteer or further their education. But other companies place no requirements on what a person must do.\nClick here to see our playlist about English for Work\nVoice 1 \nIt is easy to understand how a break from work can help a person. But will a break from work help a company? How can working less make someone a better worker? David Burkus is a teacher at Oral Roberts University. He speaks at conferences about leadership. He wrote about sabbaticals for the Harvard Business Review:\nVoice 5 \n“The research found that people who took sabbaticals experienced less stress and an increase in overall well-being. Those positive changes often remained long after the people returned to work. The employees benefit from time away, but the organization benefits as well. The majority of people said the time away gave them the space to have ideas for new projects.”\nImage by Free-Photos from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSabbatical programs are still not offered to most people. Does this mean that sabbaticals are only for a few people who teach at a university or work at a company that offers sabbaticals? How can a farmer take a sabbatical? Or a builder? Or writer?\nVoice 1 \nMost people in the world work in places where they only get paid if they work. If they do not come to work, they risk losing their position. But as companies around the world start to see the advantage of offering sabbaticals, more are beginning to offer them.\nVoice 2 \nThe Hilton Hotel gave sabbaticals to workers from Sri Lanka and Singapore. Starbucks Coffee offers some workers in China up to a year-long sabbatical. In India there has been increasing interest in sabbaticals. People are finding ways to work less, travel, and experience life. Mario D’Souza works in marketing. He wanted to take a sabbatical, but his company did not offer one. He decided to make his own sabbatical. He told Fortune India:\nVoice 6 \n“I had to plan for this break. I do not get paid for this time. So I have had to think through expenses. I stopped doing things such as eating out, watching films and ordering food. But it has been great! The amount of money I spent on these kind of things was amazing. I only understood when I made myself do this.”\nVoice 1 \nBut what about people who cannot afford to take time away from work? Everyone needs time to rest from their work. There are several ways that people can make rest part of their lives.\nVoice 2 \nThe first idea is to take one day off from work each week. You rest, spend time with family, or gather with your religious community. The second thing is to take one day each month and disconnect from everything. Leave your phone at home and go outside. Walk through nature. Sit and do nothing. Slow down and think about your life.\nImage by Fabricio Macedo FGMsp from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nMaybe your life does not permit either of those things. One final thing may still be possible: disconnect for one hour each day. One hour each day may not feel possible. So, start with ten minutes and then build up to one hour. By taking this time you will be more productive. But you may also live a happier life!\nVoice 2 \nIf you could take a sabbatical, what would you do? Have you taken a sabbatical before? Did it help you? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow Along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nImagine this situation. You studied very hard in school. Now you have finished. You dreamed of getting a good job in the United States. Finally, your dream came true. It is your first day of work. Now, you are walking into your work place on the first day. You see your supervisor – the person who will be your boss and tell you what to do. Your supervisor reaches out a hand. Suddenly you are not sure what to do! Should you reach out your hand too? Should you say something or wait for your supervisor to speak first? What should you do?\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight is on work culture. Each work place has its own culture. This culture guides the way supervisors and employees talk to each other. The values of a company influence a workplace culture. The culture of the country where you work can also influence work culture. Some people may move to a new country to take a new job. They may not know what to expect in a new culture. It can be difficult to know the right behavior in new situations. It can even be difficult to know the best way to communicate. In today’s program we share a few things people can do to learn the culture at their work place.\nPhoto by Marten Bjork\nVoice 1 \nImmihelp.com is a website that gives advice for people moving to and working in the United States. They give general advice about many things people may experience there. One area where they offer advice is work culture. On their website, they say:\nVoice 3 \n“People in the U.S. have many different kinds of jobs. Work culture and office environment may be different across different industries and different parts of the country. Even different companies in the same industry and in the same area may have different work cultures.”\nVoice 2 \nImmihelp is a website particularly for people living in the US. But this idea is true no matter where in the world people work and live. Every work culture is different. So it is difficult to make or follow an exact list of rules that helps in every situation. However, there are some general methods people can follow to learn the culture of a work place. This advice can be helpful for any person starting a job. This advice may also be helpful to people who are experiencing problems at their current job.\nVoice 1 \nEveryone who works should know the rules. When you begin working at any job, you can ask for the employee manual. Most work places make this list of rules. Read through the rules. They should tell you rules about taking holidays or vacation, policies about using the computer, and other helpful rules.\nVoice 2 \nAn employee manual will also tell the dress code. The dress code tells what clothes are good to wear at that work place. Some work places require employees to wear a uniform. Others require employees to wear formal clothes, and others do not require any special clothes at all.\nVoice 1  \nA written rule guide is very helpful. But many work culture rules are not written. One good way to learn a work culture is to observe your co-workers, the people that you work with. For example, observe how people greet each other. Is it different when a boss greets an employee? What happens when co-workers greet each other? It can be helpful to watch these greetings and then use them yourself.\nVoice 2  \nYou can also learn other social rules from observation. For example, different cultures have different rules about how close to stand to another person. The website skillsconnect is for immigrants finding jobs in Canada. They write this advice on their website.\nVoice 4  \n“Watch your co-workers’ body language and change yours to fit in. For example, Canadians are most comfortable with 18 inches between each other when meeting or talking. Standing closer is considered rude and invasive. Standing further away appears that you are not interested in the other person, or that you are too shy.”\nPhoto by Proxyclick Visitor Management System\nVoice 1  \nObserving behavior in an office is one good thing to do. But it can also help to talk with your co-workers. This advice comes from Satheesh Kumar. He is from India. Kumar studied computers there. Then he got a job in the United States. He noticed the work cultures of the two countries were very different. Kumar began a blog to tell other people from India coming to work in the US what they could expect. On his blog he says that a simple thing can help you gain trust from your co-workers. That thing is eating the lunch meal with them! He says:\nVoice 5  \n“It is probably very common for people to eat lunch with co-workers. But some do not understand the importance of it in the working world. It is especially important when you are working in a different country like in the US and in a different work culture.”\nVoice 2  \nKumar explains that while you are all eating a meal, you can talk about things other than work. You can talk about a person’s family or the things they are interested in. It is also a chance to ask about the culture you are in, and to share information about your own culture. Most of all, it is a chance to build a personal relationship.\nVoice 1  \nFinally, do not be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure how to do something, or what is accepted, you can ask someone else. Immihelp writes on their website:\nVoice 3  \n“If you are not sure about something at your work, do not act like you know it. Admit it honestly and go ask the right person. Concentrate on key areas of knowledge. Develop your skills accordingly. Do not act like you know everything. Sooner or later, people will discover that you do not know. And that may negatively affect your performance.”\nVoice 2  \nThere can be many things to learn and remember when you start a new job. In the beginning, it can be difficult. But if you keep a positive attitude and try, you will do well.\nVoice 1  \nThe writer of this program was Liz Waid. The producer was Mark Drenth. The voices you heard were from the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nHow much money would you pay for a pair of shoes? Christopher Michael Shellis is a jewelry designer. He designs beautiful jewelry that people can wear around their fingers, necks, or wrists. In 2011, he designed a very interesting pair of shoes. The shoes were made of solid gold. They were covered with over 2,000 shiny diamonds. Shellis called the shoes “jewelry you can wear on your feet”. These shoes cost more money than any other shoes in the world — 140,000 Great British Pounds!\nVoice 2 \nMost people cannot buy expensive shoes like these. And many people do not even want them! But people everywhere do wear shoes. Today’s Spotlight is on shoes. A shoe seems like a simple thing – it just needs to protect a foot from the ground. But there are many different kinds of shoes from all around the world. And the history and culture of each place has influenced the design of its shoes. Today, we travel around the world looking at shoes!\nVoice 1 \nIn the Middle East, religion has influenced shoe design. One popular kind of shoe here is the babouche. This design of shoe is a traditional shoe from Morocco. Traditional babouches are made from soft leather. They have a pointed toe. Some have bead decorations, or a design made from thin, colored, thread.\nBabouche Slippers in Morocco; “Babouche Slippers” (CC BY 2.0) by just_a_cheeseburger\nVoice 2 \nSo how has religion influenced this shoe design? People worshipping at a mosque must remove their shoes. They may not wear shoes when they enter. So, they want a shoe they can remove easily. Babouches cover most of the foot. But they do not cover the heel, or back of the foot. This makes the shoe easy to put on and to remove. People also like babouches because they do not make a person’s foot too hot. And they are very comfortable.\nVoice 1 \nReligion and culture have also influenced the design of shoes in India. The paduka is a very old shoe design there. Experts believe this design is over 4,000 years old! It is a sandal – it does not cover the whole foot. But it goes on the foot easily and keeps it cool.\nPaduka sandal from India; Pebble101, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nPadukas have a simple design. A paduka maker cuts a piece of wood into the rough shape of the bottom of a foot. Then, he adds a small knob on the top. This knob is a small round piece of wood. It sits between a person’s first two toes. Under the base of the shoe, there are thin rounded pieces of wood in the back and front. These pieces of wood raise the shoe off the ground.\nVoice 1 \nThe Hindu religion is common in India. Hindus believe they should not harm any living thing. The design of padukas follows this idea. The area of the shoe that touches the ground is very small. It is less likely to harm the ground under it or any insect around it. Also, padukas are never made from leather – animal skin. Instead, they are always made from wood, ivory or metal. Today, very religious people usually wear padukas. Or people may wear them to a special ceremony or event.\nVoice 2 \nTravel with us now to a much colder climate – the country of Finland, in northern Europe. The people here would not wear sandals at all! Instead, the Saami people of Finland wear very warm boots. The Saami people keep and raise reindeer. Reindeer are very large animals. They have antlers – long, hard, bones that grow from their heads. The Saami people keep the reindeer for food. But the reindeer also provide the Saami with the material for their boots!\nSaami boots from Norway; Daderot, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nTraditional Saami reindeer boots cover a person’s whole foot. And they may cover some of the leg too. The Saami make these traditional boots from reindeer skin leather. The hair on the skin helps make the boots very warm. Reindeer hair is shaped like a tube. It has air inside. This helps keep the reindeer warm. It also means that reindeer boots are very warm! Traditional reindeer boots have a point or a kind of hook at the end – the end of the boot points up.\nVoice 2 \nMany cultures have influenced the design of shoes. But shoes also become an important part of a culture. This is the case with klompen from the Netherlands. Each klompen shoe is made from a solid piece of wood. The inside of the shoe is cut out, so a foot can go in it. Many people think of klompen when they think of the Netherlands.\nAn old pair of Klompen from the Netherlands; Image by Aline Dassel from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe design of klompen shoes is over 800 years old. They were originally the shoe of factory workers. That is because klompen are excellent at protecting feet. They protect feet from sharp objects and harmful liquid acids. Today, few people wear klompen as a common shoe. But people may wear them for working outside. And they are a very popular thing people bring home when they visit the Netherlands!\nVoice 2 \nFinally, we travel to the island of Japan. Here, we see geta. Geta are a traditional shoe in Japan. A geta sandal is usually made from wood and cloth. When wearing a geta, a person’s foot sits on a long square of wood. In the middle of the geta there is a cloth that forms a shape like a letter “V”. This cloth comes up in the center of the sandal. It goes between a person’s first and second toes, and then to the middle of the sandal. When a person’s foot is in geta, it is not in the center of the geta. But this also means each geta – the one for the right foot, and the one for the left foot – looks the same.\nGeta Sandals from Japan; Image by Miguel Á. Padriñán from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nUnder the base of the shoe there are two straight wooden “ha”. This word means “teeth” in the Japanese language. There are ha in the front and in the back. Usually geta are about 3-5 centimetres tall. They are a popular shoe for men and women in Japan.\nVoice 2 \nIt is easy to see how each place and each culture needs their own kind of shoe.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nAdil Das recently immigrated to Vancouver, Canada from eastern India. Das enjoys living in Canada. But sometimes he does not understand particular things about Canadian culture. One day, Das was watching television. A short advertisement began playing. A map of North America appeared on the television. On the map was a picture of a pig. Slowly, the pig began to grow. It got fatter and fatter. Soon, the pig covered the whole map. Then, a voice said,\nVoice 2 \n“The average North American buys five times more things than a Mexican, ten times more than a Chinese person, and 30 times more than a person from India.”\nVoice 1 \nThe advertisement was a message about “Buy Nothing Day.” This holiday encourages people to stop buying things. Das is not sure how he feels about “Buy Nothing Day.” He works hard. And he wants his family to be able to buy things that they want. He wonders why Canadians would celebrate not buying anything. Today’s Spotlight is on the unusual holiday – “Buy Nothing Day.”\nVoice 2 \n“Buy Nothing Day” began in the 1990s in Vancouver, Canada. It was the idea of a man named Kalle Lasn and his organization Adbusters. Before starting Adbusters, Lasn worked for many years in advertising. He helped companies research what influenced people to buy things. But Lasn began to question the ways advertisers influenced people to buy things. He also questioned the culture of buying. Was it good to make people feel like they should always want more and more? “Buy Nothing Day” criticizes this culture of consumerism.\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nLasn recognizes that people need to consume things. They have to buy things to eat, live and even enjoy life. But Lasn believes that many companies encourage people to consume far more than is necessary. Advertising this way helps companies make money. But Lasn believes it hurts people and culture. Lasn told The Sun Magazine,\nVoice 3 \n“Companies have reduced us to consumers. They encourage us not to take part in society. We are just supposed to listen and watch advertisements and then buy. The media tells us that our desire to belong can be satisfied at any store, for the right price.”\nVoice 2 \nSo Lasn decided to use advertising against companies. Adbusters tries to help people understand some of the false values and ideas behind advertising. The main value Adbusters fights is the idea, “You must consume more to be happy.” And one way they do this is by encouraging people to celebrate “Buy Nothing Day!”\nVoice 1  \n“Buy Nothing Day” is celebrated on the fourth Friday of every November. Adbusters chose this day for a very important reason. It is the biggest buying day of the year. Advertisers call this day Black Friday.\nVoice 2  \nBlack Friday is particularly famous in the United States. It is the day after the country’s Thanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving, people in the United States gather with family and friends to eat a meal and give thanks. In recent years, stores began to reduce their prices the day after Thanksgiving. They wanted to encourage people to start buying gifts for the Christmas holiday in December.\nVoice 1\nHowever, in recent years, Black Friday has become famous for something else: greed and violence. On Black Friday, stores offer extremely reduced prices. But they only offer limited amounts of product. So people come early in the morning – or even the night before – to stand in lines outside stores. Sometimes, people push or fight to be first into the store. Some people have even died in Black Friday riots!\nImage by gingerbreadca from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \n“Buy Nothing Day” hopes to end the greed and violence of Black Friday. But its message is bigger than just Black Friday. “Buy Nothing Day” is for people in the United States and around the world. Many other countries also have growing problems with too much consumption. Sixty-two different countries, from Germany to Japan, already celebrate “Buy Nothing Day”. And the message is the same everywhere – buying too much hurts people, culture and the planet. The British “Buy Nothing Day” website explains,\nVoice 4\n“Buy Nothing Day is a simple idea. It fights consumer culture by asking us to stop buying for a day. Anyone can do it if they spend a day without buying.”\nVoice 1  \nFor some people, “Buy Nothing Day” is a protest. For other people, it is a party. Some groups go to stores and encourage other people not to buy things. Other people gather together to make Christmas gifts instead of buying them. And some people use the day to create works of art that protest against consumer messages. Often, people celebrate by enjoying the free gift of nature. They go for walks or watch the sunset together. The only rule of “Buy Nothing Day” is not to buy anything!\nVoice 2  \nSome people question if “Buy Nothing Day” can really change culture. It is only one day. And telling people not to do something often does not work! Other people say that consumers should not just buy less, but they should buy better. These people encourage consumers to buy things that are made in ways that do not hurt people or the environment.\nVoice 1  \nBut “Buy Nothing Day” does get people thinking about the negative effects of buying too much. Kalle Lasn told The Independent news organization,\nVoice 3  \n“A lot of people have had deep learning experiences when they tried celebrating “Buy Nothing Day”. It was like giving up an addiction to drugs.”\nImage by Robert Pastryk from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nBuying more and more things can be like an addiction. Often, the more people buy things, the more things they want. Tom Gilovich is a human behavior scientist. He performed several studies that examined people’s emotions when they buy things. And he found that people are happier and more satisfied when they spend money on experiences instead of things. He wrote,\nVoice 5  \n“Satisfaction over purchases decreases over time. A new car does not stay new for very long. But a satisfying experience often becomes more positive over time as we remember it.”\nVoice 1  \nSo, what do you think about “Buy Nothing Day?” Is buying too much a problem in your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever had a problem? You are a person, so of course you have! Maybe your motorbike would not start. Maybe you needed to fix a toilet. Maybe you did not know how to download something to your smartphone. All people have problems. But what was the first thing you did to solve your problem?\nVoice 2  \nIf you can connect to the Internet, one of the first things you probably did was search there for an answer. There, you can find information and videos to help you with almost any problem. These how-to videos are very popular. That is because more and more people are interested in doing things themselves. More people are becoming interested in growing, making, and fixing things. This growing interest is known as the maker movement. Today’s Spotlight is on the maker movement.\nVoice 1\n The maker movement includes a lot of different people and ideas. It includes people working independently to invent, create or design. Makers are people who design and create their own clothes or grow their own food. Many makers look at things in the world and say, “I could make that.” Or they may say, “I think I could make that better.” Or they dream of something they wish existed. And when they do not find it, they try to create it.\nVoice 2  \nPeople have always made things. Ancient people made baskets, bowls, and tools. One generation of people taught the next. Parents taught children. This was how people shared knowledge, experience, and wisdom with each other.\nVoice 1  \nBut things started to change. Machines made it easier to grow food. So, fewer people needed to work on farms. So they moved to cities. They found work in factories. But then factories started to use machines. It started to cost less money to buy a new thing than to fix an old one. People began to forget how to grow food, create things, or fix things when they broke.\nPhoto by Maxim Selyuk\nVoice 2  \nAnd many people are tired of this. They do not want to throw things away. They want to be able to fix things that break. They want to grow their own food. They do not want to depend on factories or stores. They want to use knowledge and skills instead of spending money. In this way, the maker movement is a kind of return to the way things used to be.\nVoice 1  \nThe maker movement includes traditional work like weaving cloth, making things out of wood, and growing your own food. But it also accepts and uses new technologies. Computers are now much less frightening to people than they used to be. More people understand how they work. Children learn to write code for computers in school. The Internet provides training and a way to connect to other makers.\nVoice 2  \nPeople in the maker movement come together to make things. Maker Faires are gatherings of these people. They spend a few days together talking, planning, inventing, and solving problems. These Faires began in the United States, but have spread to every continent. For example, in 2016 there was a Maker Faire in Shenzhen, China. At the Faire people taught wooden knife making, drawing, and how to build a robot out of LEGO building bricks. There was even a clothes fashion show. Much of the clothing was wearable technology. It had built-in computers, lights, or body sensors.\nVoice 1  \nAnother kind of gathering of makers is called a Repair Café. People bring their broken things to the Repair Café. The Café has tools and supplies to fix things. There are also experts who offer to teach people how to fix what they have brought in. But whenever possible, the people must do the work themselves. Repair Cafés began in Amsterdam, but have also spread around the world. There are Repair Cafés in Egypt, Kenya, Ghana, Thailand, Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Azerbaijan, China and many other countries.\nVoice 2  \nAnd the maker movement is still growing. It is even starting to change education. Some schools are creating “maker spaces.” In these places, children can invent, combine, and discover. Jim Tiffin is a teacher in New York, in the US. His students do not just sit and listen to him talk. In the maker-space, they do things. He told the Scholastic website,\nVoice 3  \n“It has had the most empowering effect on students of any of the courses that I have taught. Students are taking the experiences from this class and using them in their other classes.”\nPhoto by Devin Edwards\nVoice 1  \nExperts say that any school can be a maker space like this. They do not need high cost equipment or supplies. They can use paper, broken toys, string, clay or tape. Any materials will work. Students just have to make things!\nVoice 2  \nBut schools are not the only places interested in the maker movement. Some big businesses also try to use the maker movement to sell more products. The clothing company Levis sells millions of pairs of blue jeans around the world. Many people do not consider them to be part of the maker movement. But Levis tries to find people who are making creative things. Then they put these things on their website. Big businesses like this tell the stories of these makers. People like the stories and buy more clothing. This way they try to seem like they are part of the maker movement even if they are making clothes in big factories.\nVoice 1  \nMany people do not want to just use things and throw them in the garbage. They want to use their hands. They want to learn. They want to be independent and in control. Tim Bajarin wrote about the maker movement for Time Magazine. He wrote:\nVoice 4  \n“The more I look into it, the more I believe that the maker movement is very important to America’s future. It may be able to turn more and more people into makers instead of just people who use things. I know from history that when you give makers the right tools and good ideas, they can change the world.”\nVoice 2  \nDo you like to learn new things? Do you like to create and repair?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nYoshiyuki Miyamae loves to design and create clothes. He is a successful clothes designer. As a young boy he wanted the clothes that he saw in stores, but they cost too much money. So he began to make his own clothes. When he was a university student, Miyamae was able to attend a clothing show by another Japanese designer, Issey Miyake. He saw how clothes could change how people felt. He explained to the Thailand Tatler,\nVoice 3  \n“How does what we wear influence how we feel? When we wear bright colours, we are in a bright mood. When we feel tired, we do not want to wear clothes that fit close to our body. To me, this is the power of clothes.”\nVoice 2  \nClothes can simply protect us from rain, cold, or heat. But clothes can also change how people see us. They can change how we see ourselves. Clothes can even be a way to express our personality. Today’s Spotlight is on the power of clothes.\nPhoto by Dami Adebayo\nVoice 1  \nIf someone told you, “You look nice today!” what would you imagine you are wearing? A colourful dress? A shirt and necktie? Maybe your favorite shirt or shoes? The answer depends on where you live. Clothes are different around the world. Also, there are different clothes for different situations or events.\nVoice 2  \nThe clothes we wear communicate something. Some people like clothes that are wild and crazy. Other people like clothes that are quiet and simple. Each choice tells the world something. Clothes shape us in ways we may not even understand. For example, in school, many children all wear the same uniforms. Research shows that children who wear uniforms learn better in school. When people wear clothes for exercise, they are more likely to exercise. Even the color of our clothes can change how we feel. Gauri Sarda-Joshi wrote for Brain Fodder about this. She wrote,\nVoice 4  \n“While our mental state clearly affects the way we dress; the opposite may also be true. What we wear could affect how we react when we are sad, nervous, or feeling stress. Research says the fastest little fix for a bad day is to wear brightly colored clothes. Happy colors can improve how we feel and how much energy we have. We connect bright colors with happiness, days in the sun, and carefree times like the summer vacations when we were children.”\nPhoto by Sharon Garcia\nVoice 1  \nOur clothes can even change the way we think. In 2015, the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science published a study. The study looked at how students felt wearing different kinds of clothes. Formal clothing is clothing a person may wear to work or an important event. The study found that when the students dressed in formal clothing they were better at thinking about complex problems.\nVoice 2  \nMany jobs used to require people to wear formal clothing. This could be a suit and tie for a man and a dress for women. But now this is less common. People dress more in casual clothes — clothes that are more comfortable. But this does not mean formal clothing is going away. Michael Slepian is one of the authors of the study. He told the Atlantic,\nVoice 5  \n“I would even guess the effect this study found could get stronger if formal clothing is only worn for the most formal of situations. It takes a long time for symbols and our agreed meaning of those symbols to change. I would not expect formal clothes as the symbol of power to be leaving us anytime soon.”\nVoice 1  \nAnd it is not just formal clothing that can have power. Scarlett Curtis was only 14 years old when she needed a medical surgery. After the surgery, she was only able to walk short distances. She stayed at home. She often stayed in bed. She only dressed in soft, comfortable clothes that were easy to sleep in. But Curtis decided to go to school in New York City and make a change. She still found clothes that made her feel comfortable. But now her clothes also helped her feel better. She began to choose clothes would look nice too. She wrote in InStyle magazine,\nVoice 6  \n“It is easy to think of clothes as things that only touch the surface. We forget the truth that every choice we make each morning says something about who we are or who we want to be. Our clothes are the protection we put on against the battle that is life. As I move back into normal life I struggle with this; the strong connection between how I feel and what I am wearing.”\nVoice 2  \nAnd yet, not everyone in the world is able to make these choices so easily. Many people do not have a lot of clothes. And in some places this becomes a problem.\nPhoto by Eloise Ambursley\nVoice 1  \nIn Myanmar there has been a lot of fighting between different groups. One result of this has been that over 100,000 people had to leave their homes in one area – Kachin State. Many of these people live in refugee camps. They do not have money or stores to buy clothes. The Japanese clothing company UNIQLO decided to work with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to do something.\nVoice 2  \nUNIQLO gave clothing from Japan to the refugees in Myanmar. One woman who left her home in Myanmar explained to the UNHCR why this was important:\nVoice 7  \n“Some of us even had no choice than to leave by foot. We heard the gun shots and we escaped. We could carry one or two sets of clothes. What we are wearing is what we brought from home. When we left we took some things with us, but not a lot. We did not think it would take so long before we could return to our villages.”\nVoice 1  \nEven in a bad situation, good clothes can make people feel a little better. People living in refugee camps do not care about the latest trends in fashion. They want new, clean clothes. It does not solve all their problems. But it does help them feel better.\nVoice 2  \nWhat about you? Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? How do you feel when you wear it? Tell us about it. You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nWhat do you think of when you hear the word “luxury”? Some people may think of lying in the sand on a beautiful ocean beach. Others may think of sitting on a costly boat in the sun, enjoying a cold drink. These are experiences of luxury. But luxury also involves goods and services. Here are some real luxury goods that people can buy:\nA solid gold baby bed for 16 million dollars\nWomen’s underwear, covered in jewels, for 10 million dollars\nA brand-name watch for 42000 dollars\nA popular hand bag for 4,900 dollars\nA martini drink for 1,000 dollars\nA one-person dinner for 270 dollars\nVoice 2 \nThese are extreme examples of available luxury goods. Most people could never buy these expensive things. But many people can, and do. What makes people want luxury? Is it good for us? Today’s Spotlight is on luxury.\nVoice 1 \nTo some people, luxury means excess, or having more than what is necessary. To others, luxury means goods and services that cost a lot of money. In this case, luxury can represent high quality. Or it can also just represent the image of a particular brand name. The Oxford Dictionary defines luxury as both a state of being and as a thing. It says that Luxury is a state of living with ease and excess. And it says Luxury is a thing that is not needed, but desired, expensive, and difficult to get.\nVoice 2 \nThe global market for luxury goods and services is growing. Euromonitor reports that in five years, from 2010 to 2014, the luxury goods market grew 36%! It estimates that by 2019, the global market for luxury goods will have increased 88% in ten years.\nVoice 1 \nSo why are luxury goods so popular, especially since they are difficult to get? One of the reasons is because they are so difficult to get. It makes people feel like they have status, or a high position, that other people do not have. The website Psychology Today states,\nVoice 3 \n“Buyers purchase luxury goods for different reasons. One reason is that luxury goods give a sense of status and wealth. They help people feel exclusive, or more rare and special than others.”\nVoice 2 \nLuxury brand names want to stay exclusive, or only available to a few people. They encourage the sense that people who buy their products are better than others. If too many people have a particular product, it loses its appeal. Simon Peck is from the House of Luxury, a company that sells watches and jewels. Peck told the BBC,\nVoice 4 \n“When the person who drives you around owns the same watch as you, it is time to look for something better.”\nVoice 1  \nBut not everyone wants luxury just to feel better than everyone else. Some people simply want to be like everyone else. Farnoosh Brock writes a blog on the internet. She wrote about her desire for luxury products. Brock travelled several times to Japan. There, she saw many women with expensive, $5,000 bags. Then, she wanted one. She wrote about it on her blog ProlificLiving. She said that buying particular brands is very popular in Japan.\nVoice 5\n“The brand buying popularity in Japan is about a person’s place in society. The top Western brand names speak loudly in that culture. So naturally, everyone buys them. Possibly this is because everyone wants to belong – to be accepted as an equal.”\nPhoto: Junko Nakase\nVoice 1 \nBut Brock is also conflicted about the strength of her desire for a luxury bag. She writes,\nVoice 5  \n“I really, badly want a luxury Prada bag. Suppose I buy my Prada bag. Will I stop wanting the beautiful sun glasses that go with it? What about the perfect little black dress? Or will I need to learn to redefine the meaning of being pleased and satisfied?”\nVoice 2\nFor other people, luxury is more about beauty. Writer Dana Thomas wrote a book about luxury. Thomas says that not all luxury is greed. She told the Luxury Society,\nVoice 6 \n“Luxury is moral when it comes from creativity and not greed. When you create to make something beautiful, then you are being moral, spiritual, and true.”\nVoice 1 \nLuxury does not have to only represent a fashionable brand. It can also represent high achievement in beauty and creativity. But you still need to have wealth in order to possess luxury.\nVoice 2 \nBuying and experiencing luxury puts a person in a rare group. Many, many people in this world are poor. The World Bank reports that more than 2 billion people live in poverty, and more than 1 billion live in extreme poverty. The United Nations reports that almost half of the world’s children live in extreme poverty. Three hundred million children actually go to bed hungry every night.\nVoice 1 \nThe inequality of people living in poverty and in luxury is very clear. And it brings up an important question: is luxury morally WRONG? Is it wrong to spend 16 million dollars on a golden bed for a baby? Is it wrong to spend thousands of dollars on shoes? That money could buy food for very poor people. It could support schools. It could do many other things too\nVoice 2 \nThis is a complex debate. You may not be able to buy $5,000 shoes. But you may be able to spend $50, or $100, or possibly even $500. These are still large amounts of money! Any of those amounts could help a poor person. But you need shoes too! How can you tell what exact amount is morally right to spend?\nVoice 1 \nChristian teaching moves the question away from numbers and products. The Christian Bible does not say that having wealth is wrong. Or even that desire for beauty and comfort is wrong. It says,\nVoice 3\n“Keep your lives free from the love of money. Be happy with what you have. For Jesus said, ‘I will never leave you.’”\nVoice 2 \nThis teaching asks us to examine our hearts. Jesus’ followers believe that they do not have to chase wealth. They can have money, but they should not love money. They believe that God will provide for their needs, including the presence of Jesus.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nParents do many things that children never see. Parents pay school costs. They buy clothes and food. They pay bills. They fix things when they break. They make rules that protect the children. Children do not always understand all the work it takes to be a parent.\nVoice 1 \nYoung children sometimes dream about what they will do differently when they become parents. They may think they will stay up all night. They will watch movies and eat candy. And when they become parents they will let THEIR children have lots of fun. They will never shout at or punish their children.\nVoice 2\nBut some children must learn very quickly that being a parent is not easy. In terrible situations, both a mother and father cannot care for their children. The reason may be death, illness, or even parents that are present, but too stressed. When this happens, the oldest child can become like the parent to the other children. The older child needs to learn about all the things a parent must do. A child is rarely prepared to do any of them. Today’s Spotlight is on forming a family when siblings — brothers and sisters — must act like parents.\nVoice 1 \nKathy Borkowski was only nineteen [19] years old when her father died. Her mother had died three years earlier. She had a brother who was fourteen [14], a sister who was thirteen [13] and another brother who was ten [10]. Kathy was old enough to live by herself, but her siblings were not. She did have family, but they lived far away. Some of her family were willing to care for one child. But no one could take them all.\nVoice 2\nKathy wanted to keep her siblings together. Her mother had died. Then her father had died. She did not want the rest of her family to be separated. So, she decided to become mother to her own siblings.\nVoice 1 \nKathy had to become more responsible than most nineteen [19] year- old people. She could not go out with her friends on the weekend. She did not have time for a boyfriend. She had to worry about being a good parent. She did not even have much time to think about her own parents’ death. She told NPR:\nVoice 3 \n“Probably one of the most difficult parts is that we had to just keep going. It has taken a long time to understand the death of our parents. It was difficult for my brothers and sisters. They had this loss too. And suddenly, their big sister was in control. And they did not have any other choice.”\nVoice 2\nKathy lives in the United States, but all around the world people take care of their siblings. Death, sickness or even events like earthquakes or flooding can separate families. For Gloria Affia, war separated her family.\nVoice 1 \nGloria Affia was seventeen [17] years old. She lived in Juba, the capital of South Sudan with her brother, age 12, and her sister, age four. Her parents had died. The children were living with their uncle. In twenty sixteen [2016] there was a civil war in South Sudan. Soldiers killed her uncle. Gloria fled with her younger siblings to the country of Uganda.\nVoice 2\nGloria and her siblings settled in a refugee camp. There, she began to understand that now she would have to take care of her siblings. She explained to the Danish Refugee Council,\nVoice 4 \n“When we arrived at the camp, a woman was supposed to take care of us. But she went back to Congo, where she was from. Now, I do not know what will happen next. There is no one other than me to take care of my brothers and sisters. It often feels like too much responsibility, but what can I do? There is no one else.”\nVoice 1 \nGloria is doing the best she can in a difficult situation. She is not able to attend school because she must work. She is learning how to make clothes. But she is proud that her hard work means that her siblings are able to attend school. She is trying to give her siblings a good life, just like a parent would.\nVoice 2\nPeople who raise their own siblings have many challenges. They may need legal control of their siblings to make big decisions. And a sibling in authority is a still a sibling. And siblings often fight! They fight about big things and little things. But just because one sibling has authority, it does not mean that all the siblings are going to listen and obey.\nVoice 1 \nSiblings who act like parents need emotional and physical support. They have lost their parents. But older siblings like Kathy or Gloria do not often have time to stop and cry and be sad. These older siblings need to find food, money, and a safe place to sleep.\nVoice 2\nBut no one raises children on their own. All parents need a support system – people and groups who can help. Help can be government programs, religious communities, families, or friends. Vicki Panaccione is a child psychologist and works at the Better Parenting Institute. She told NPR,\nVoice 5\n“The support system is very important for siblings acting like parents. And some people do not have one. They are alone. They are in this middle place because they are not with people their own age. But they do not fit in with the parents, either. Parents look at them as a child. It is important for that sibling to talk with someone who is in a similar position, or to family members or friends. No one should have to take this work all on their own.”\nVoice 1 \nSiblings that act like parents are dealing with tragedy. But a family formed this way does not have to hold only sadness. They can also hold love. Kathy Borkowski, from the beginning of this program, raised her siblings. Today, she says they are very close. One of her brothers has his own three children. Kathy says they are more than just her nieces. They are more like grandchildren.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live. \nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nDo you recognize this song from a television program? The program ended in 2004. But it is still one of most the popular programs around the world. It is the 26th most popular English language program on earth. In India and Pakistan, it is still the third most popular English language show. It is the television program “Friends”.\nVoice 1\nThis show is about the lives of six people: Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe. They are all friends who live in New York. They are always together. They drink coffee, eat meals, watch television, and do other things. Each character has a job. Each character has a family. But the important relationships in this show are the friendships. This is why the show is called “Friends”. \nVoice 2\nLife can be like this program. When a person moves away from their family, their friends can become the most important relationships they have. Or this can happen because of a bad relationship with parent. Or maybe a person’s family has died. These situations can make people look for new relationships. Today’s Spotlight is on when friends become family. \nVoice 1\nA program like Friends has all the things that people want in relationships. People want to feel  close to the people they love. They want to be able to talk about anything. They want to know  people for many years, sometimes even a lifetime. People want things to be easy. They want to be able to call a friend without planning and talk or eat a meal together. \nVoice 2\nDeborah Tannen is a teacher at Georgetown University. In 2016 she was writing a book about friendship. She talked to many people. She was surprised at how many people said that their best friends were like family.\nVoice 1\nThey shared stories and experiences with each other. They shared meals. One man said that  he did not really enjoy spending time with his friend, but that he had to, because the man was like family! Tannen understood that many of these people felt “close” to a person in some way a way that felt comfortable. Tannen thought about her own friend, Karl. She recognized how he had many of the things she wanted in a friend. She wrote: \nVoice 3\n“If I am angry or sad about something, I call him. I trust his judgement, though I might not always follow his advice. And most of all, there is comfort. I feel completely comfortable in his  home. When I am around him, I can be completely myself. I do not have to worry.” \nVoice 2\nFriends that make us feel at home are wonderful. But everyone knows that friendships are not  always easy. Even on a program like Friends, people fight with each other. Tannen writes,\nVoice 4\n“Just as with families, friends who are like family can bring happiness but also pain. The comfort of a close relationship can sometimes change and make you feel trapped. The closer the connection, the greater the power to hurt. Your friend may disappoint you or make you sad.”\nVoice 1\nThe people who understand us are people who have experienced what we have experienced. This is why sometimes friends become like family. Imagine two people serving together in a war. Thomas Brennan served in the United States military. He fought in wars both in Iraq and Afghanistan. He told the New York Times that,\n Voice 5\n“I feel pride in my country. I have seen things that made me sometimes regret my service. But I felt a calling to serve. In my case, it was because of the attacks of 9/11. I have learned that I will always belong to a brotherhood until I die. The military are my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe strong feelings for the people you fight with exist in militaries all around the world. In fact, it can be difficult for people who have served in war to make new friends. They are joined to other soldiers by very difficult situations. When they return home, they do not have the same people around them. Their family does not understand what they experienced. They can feel lonely. People who serve in the military sometimes need help connecting to NEW people when they finish their military service.\nVoice 1\nIt is not just war that connects people. Sneha Ashtikar moved from Mumbai, India to Paris, France. She only knew one person and was very lonely. In India, she talked to her mother every day. She missed this. It took time, but eventually her friends filled this need for her. Ashtikar told the website HelloGiggles,\nVoice 6\n“My friends are my family in Paris. Not only have they helped me through rough times, they have also shaped my personality in so many ways. My parents and friends back home are definitely supportive, but physical presence changes everything.”\nVoice 2\nAshtikar’s friends helped her find a place to live. They help her with other problems. They celebrate holidays together. And when she misses India, they help cheer her up. She says,\nVoice 7\n“If you are with the right people, your friends can lift you up and give you courage to survive any problem. It may relate to living in a different country or just being a human. They will be proud of you when you earn an achievement. They will teach you to love yourself. They will get mad at you when you are wrong. They will prevent you from making bad choices. Your friends will fill the hole and be your family.”\nVoice 1\nBut can your friends replace your family? It is difficult to know. Sometimes important relationships form between family members. Sometimes they happen between friends. We all need people in our lives who accept us for who we are. We all need people who will help us to grow and change. For many people, this is a family of friends.\nVoice 2\nWhat do you think? Do you have a friend who is so close that you think of them as family? Do you have a person in your family that you would call your best friend? Tell us about them. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIto wakes up at 6 in the evening. He wears the same clothes that he did yesterday. His crowded room is filled with empty drink bottles and food wrappers. A huge desk takes up one side of the room. When Ito wakes, he does not get ready for class. He does not get ready for work. Instead, he goes to his computer. And, he plays video games for the entire day Sometimes, his mother comes to bring him food. He thanks her, but says nothing else. Ito’s life is the same the next day, and the next. He has lived without seeing other people for the past three years.\nVoice 2\nIto is one of Japan’s hikikomori. A hikikomori is someone in Japan who withdraws from society. Usually, these are young men. They isolate themselves from other people. And they depend on their parents to survive. Today, there may be a million people living like Ito. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on the Hikikomori.\nVoice 1\nJapan has a very unique society. Traditionally, parents and children live together for many years. Several generations often live together at a time. And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.\nVoice 2\nBut people do not become Hikikomori because they do not want to work. It is usually because of a great pain. A hikikomori might have lost a job. Or, they might be bullied in school. They see these events as failures. And, once they have failed, it is difficult to try again. Masaki Ikegami is a journalist who writes about the hikikomori. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 3\n“The Japanese society makes it difficult for people to succeed once they have made a mistake. I think most hikikomori have had difficulty with their working life. They have been hurt by their human relationships there. Other cases might be people who have had bad experiences at school.  Or, they have been through troubles, accidents, or illnesses. Some have stopped working to stay at home and look after their aging parents. There are many different reasons. It can happen at any age.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori isolate for economic reasons. After the second World War, Japan’s economy grew quickly. College graduates got jobs easily. A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work. Or, they did not find work at all. This economic time period is known as the lost decades.\nVoice 2\nThe lost decades hurt a lot of people. In Japan, much of a person’s self-worth is based on their job. Not having a job, or not doing well in a job, causes a lot of shame. And some people feel so worthless that they stop trying at all. Naohiro Kimura was a hikikomori for ten years. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 4\n“If you finish University in Japan but do not get a job, people look at you strangely. People have a strong sense that you should be working. I was embarrassed. I did not want anyone to see me. When I saw someone wearing nice clothing, I would feel like I had caused trouble. I hated seeing working people. I would compare myself to them. It would make me feel very bad. I felt a strong sense of shame.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori also have depression, a kind of extreme sadness. Often, a depressed person will want to move. They will want to work on things. But they feel that they have no worth. They believe their efforts will not change anything. So, they feel even worse, and become more depressed. It is difficult to recover from this way of thinking.\nVoice 2\nVosot Ikeida is a hikikomori in his fifties. He became a hikikomori when he returned to Japan after living in a different country. He felt that he could not fit into Japanese society. So, he became very depressed. He told the Japan Times,\nVoice 5\n“I closed all the curtains. But the light outside still reflected on the curtains. I could see it from the back of the room. It felt like society was continuing on without me. That feeling made me lonely and insecure. Curtains were not enough. So I blocked more light from my windows. I made it like a cave. It made no difference whether I slept in the daytime or nighttime.”\nVoice 1\nHaving a hikikomori child is also very difficult for parents. Many feel that they must continue to support their children. But they also feel responsibility. Most do not know how to help. And some fear talking about their children, because they also feel shame. Maika Elanis a photojournalist. She helped document the lives of many hikikomori. She told Muse Magazine:\nVoice 6\n“Parents know that people will see them differently if they talk about their children’s lifestyle. They expect them to return to normal for months or years before seeking help. Most parents feel that a hikikomori child shows they have failed. Having someone help with it islike getting rid of your responsibility as a parent. It is like getting rid of your child.”\nVoice 2\nOnce a person becomes a hikikomori, it is very difficult to go back to normal life. Most do not know how to live by themselves. And, they do not have the skills to find a new job. The Japanese government has opened up some jobs for hikikomori. And there are special programs to teach them skills, like cooking.\nVoice 1\nBut the most helpful programs for the hikikomori help them find friends. After all, a person who is lonely or depressed does not only need a doctor. They do not only need help with getting a job. They need someone who will tell them the truth. They need someone who will try and understand them. To make them feel like they are not alone.\nVoice 2\nDo you know anyone who is lonely?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nHave you ever heard the English phrase “Don’t judge a book by its cover”? Simply, it means that the outside of something does not always match the inside of something. You may see a very exciting cover of a book. But the book itself might be very boring or just terrible!\nVoice 2\nThis saying is the idea behind a worldwide project called The Human Library. A library is full of books. But the Human Library is full of people. At this human Library there are many titles available. You can borrow anyone, from football fan to transgender woman, for 30 minutes. You might have an idea about this person already. But does the book match the cover? Today’s Spotlight is on the Human Library.\nVoice 1\nThe idea for the Human Library started in Denmark. It was for the Rosklide music festival, in Denmark. Festival organizers gathered some people who had a story to tell. Then they invited people at the festival to talk to them. They thought it would be a fun thing for people to do there. The founders of the festival did not plan for the Human Library to last long. But today it has locations all around the world. Its goal is to fight prejudice, when a person dislikes someone else for an unfair reason.\nLMU Library, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2\nPrejudice is a very real threat in Denmark. According to Bloomberg news, many Danes believe that racism is a growing problem. This kind of prejudice can lead to violence against some groups of people. It means some people are treated unfairly because they look different. Prejudice exists all around the world.\nVoice 1\nRonni Abergel is one of the founders of the Human Library. He and his partners recognized this problem. So, they started the Human Library to change things. Abergel told Radio New Zealand:\nVoice 3\n“I said: we should try and create a safe space where we can meet some of the people we think we do not like. It would be like a library where you borrow a police officer, or a night club security bouncer, or football supporter. We have a lot of ideas about people even if we do not know them. Sometimes these ideas are negative. Sometimes they are overly positive. But we do not have access to them, so we do not sit down with them.”\nVoice 2\nThe festival was a very big success. Thousands of people came to borrow different people, like they would borrow books at a library. They were human books. And Abergel began to see something amazing. He began to see people change their minds. He said,\nVoice 3\n“From the first day, I saw this working. I thought how the whole world needs a library like this, because it works. It creates a safe space where we can challenge what we think we know. We can learn and make up our minds.”\nVoice 1\nAfter the Rosklide festival, Abergel had an idea: What if the Human Library was permanent? It would be very difficult. They would need many volunteers. And they would need a permanent building where people could meet. But Abergel and his friends decided it was worth it. So in 2008, they created the Human Library Organization in Denmark.\n“Human Library at University of Essex” (CC BY 2.0) by University of Essex\nVoice 2\nSoon, the idea spread to many places in the world. Each Human Library might be a little different. But the basic idea is the same. The Human Library Organization asks people to be the human books. Each of these people has a story that is important to the world. They train the human book with their method. And they give the human book a title. The title could be something like “refugee” or “alcoholic”. Visitors can go to the Human Library. They can check out the human book that interests them. Then the visitor and book have a conversation. These conversations last about a half an hour. But, like any library, the visitor can ask to keep the book for a little longer.\nVoice 1\nWhen a person visits a Human Library, they can talk about anything. They can even ask about something they might not be comfortable asking about in person. There is no real structure to these visits. Sometimes visitors only want to ask questions. But often they check out people they disagree with. They come to argue. This is something the Human Library welcomes. The conversation might not be friendly. But even an unfriendly conversation can have positive results. Abergel says:\nVoice 3\n“We think arguments are very welcome. Because arguments are what we learn from. We might walk away agreeing to disagree. That is also pretty great.”\nVoice 2\nThese conversations can cause people to think differently. They help people unjudge. Sometimes, going to the Human Library changes lives. The Human Library sometimes partners with companies. These companies are trying to become more inclusive. They want to accept many different kinds of people. And they think the Human Library will help them do it. One of these companies is Masco. An employee of Masco talked to Forbes about how the Human Library changed him.\nChristina Birkinbine, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 4\n“I have Muslim neighbors and friends. And my human book was Muslim. And I was able to ask the book things I never felt good asking my neighbors. I learned more in 20 minutes than I have from people I have known for many years. Now I have the courage to engage differently with my neighbors and my community.”\nVoice 1\nToday, the Human Library has locations in over 80 countries. Some human books are even available for online conversation. The Human Library will not change everyone overnight. It takes a long time to get rid of prejudice. But the Human Library shows that change is possible when we reach out to others. Change is not big political acts. But it is simple conversations that change the world.\nVoice 2\nYou may not have a Human Library near you. But there are ways to have these conversations on your own. Try to talk to someone you do not know. Be friendly, and open. Ask questions, instead of telling them what you think. Bill Carney is volunteer for a Human Library in the United States. His title is “Black Activist”. He told Forbes Magazine:\nVoice 5\n“It is easy to hate a group of people. It is more difficult to hate an individual, especially if that person is trying to be friendly.”\nVoice 1\nWhat kind of person would you talk to at the Human Library?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nIn Japan, there is a place with a very strange telephone booth. The small building sits on top of a hill in the middle of a garden. It seems odd there among the flowers and other plants. It is far from the city, but many people come to use it. People travel here from all over Japan. Years ago, booths like this were common. But there is one thing that makes this booth different. The telephone inside does not work!\nVoice 2  \nLocal people call this telephone booth kaze no denwa. In English, it means “telephone of the wind”. Today’s Spotlight is on the telephone of the wind.\nVoice 1  \nItaru Sasaki is a retired steel worker. He built the telephone of the wind after his cousin died. He loved his cousin very much. And he was very sad when he died. Sasaki wanted a place to talk to his cousin, even though he was dead. He knew no one could hear him. But he hoped that talking would help him understand his deep sadness. In an interview with the radio program This American Life, Sasaki said,\nVoice 3  \n“My thoughts could not go over regular phone lines. So I wanted them to be carried on the wind.”\nVoice 2  \nSasaki placed the telephone in his garden. When he became sad, he would visit the booth. He would talk into the telephone. He would tell his cousin how he felt. It made him feel better.\nWind phone in Ōtsuchi, Japan; Matthew Komatsu (https://longreads.com/2019/03/11/after-the-tsunami/), CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1  \nFor a time, Sasaki was the only one who visited the telephone booth. But then, something horrible happened. On March 11, 2011, there was an earthquake off the coast of Japan. This was not a normal earthquake. It was one of the most powerful in over a century. The earthquake did a lot of damage in Japan. Even worse, it caused a tsunami – a huge wave. Tsunamis often begin from very large earthquakes under the water. Japan is an island in an area that has many earthquakes. So there are tsunamis also. The Japanese people thought their country was prepared and ready for any danger. They had built walls, and huge barriers on the coast to stop the damage. But no one alive had seen a wave this big.\nVoice 2  \nIn March 2011, the tsunami crashed into northern Japan. The water came over the protective walls. It destroyed homes, villages, and cities. The wave also damaged many nuclear power plants. One plant, Fukushima Daiichi, started to leak radiation. Many people who survived the tsunami still had to flee their homes. Even today, these people cannot return. Their homes, and the places they worked, are still full of poisonous radiation. Many thousands of people died in the tsunami. And even more are still missing.\nDamage to Otsuchi after the earthquake and tsunami; Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1  \nThe tsunami changed things for Sasaki. He lives in a town called Otsuchi. It is on the north-eastern coast of Japan. The tsunami destroyed most of Otsuchi. Some people tried to rebuild the town. Others just left. Life was not easy for them. Most people of the town knew someone who had died these. And the memories were very painful.\nVoice 2  \nSasaki knew how difficult these feelings were. He saw so many people struggling with their sadness. So he told them about his wind telephone. He let people come into his garden. They would use the telephone of the wind. He even put a notebook inside. Some people did not want to speak. But they could write about their feelings. Only a few people came at first. But soon, more people heard about the telephone. People from all over the country travelled to Sasaki’s garden. Some visited many times. The telephone booth became a special place. People would visit it to remember those they loved.\nVoice 1  \nNHK is a Japanese television network. They made a film about the telephone of the wind. The film was called “The Telephone of the Wind: Whispers to Lost Families.” It was broadcast on the five year anniversary of the Tsunami. NHK recorded several visitors to the telephone. Some do not speak much. Other people speak just about their lives. They talk about their jobs, or their families. There are some people who cry. They express their sadness in the open.\nVoice 2  \nIn the film, one man walks into the booth. He is a young father. His wife’s name was Mine. His son’s name was Issei. His whole family died in the tsunami. So he is very sad. As he speaks, he begins to cry. He says:\nVoice 4  \n“Dad? Mom? Mine? Issei? It has already been five years since the tsunami. If my voice reaches you, please listen. I do not know what I am living for. Issei, please let me hear you call me papa. I built a new house. But without all of you, it has no meaning. I want to hear your answer. But I cannot hear anything.”\nVoice 1  \nTalking to people who have died is something many people do. Many people honor the memory of people they loved in similar ways. They visit cemeteries and talk at the place where the person is buried. Or they visit special places. This helps them remember the one who died.\nNHK Documentary\nVoice 2  \nBut the telephone of the wind has become very special to many Japanese people. For many, the places they would visit are gone. The tsunami destroyed these places. The telephone of the wind provides a special place for anyone who wants it. It gives people the chance to express their emotions. It lets them know they are not alone.\nVoice 1  \nIn the NHK film, a mother and her children visit the telephone booth. The mother lost her husband in the tsunami. She begins to cry in the booth. She is sad that she will never see her husband again. And the booth helps the family to talk about him. As she leaves, the mother tells her children:\nVoice 5  \n“We were all so sad. We did not think we could make it through. And that is why we never talked about Dad until now. But talking to him on the telephone today, it changed something.”\nVoice 2  \nHave you ever lost someone you loved? How did you deal with that loss?

Today’s Spotlight is on the human face.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nYou are happy! Smile! Now you feel anger. Frown! Point the corners of your mouth down. Make a crease, or line, in the skin above your eyes. By moving your face into these positions, people already know how you feel. You do not even have to say a single word. In fact, some experts believe that your face can produce more than 10,000 different expressions!\nVoice 1 \nAll these expressions are possible because of the muscles in your face. They form a kind of mask over your skull. They are over your forehead, around your eyes, on your nose, through your cheeks, around your mouth, and down your chin. Your face is covered in muscles! To make an expression, you can move a few muscles at the same time. Or you can move only one muscle. Each combination is a different facial expression.\nVoice 2 \nThe expressions on your face send a message to the person who is looking at you. Without using words people can understand how you are really feeling. These facial expressions are a form of non-verbal communication. But did you know that your face may also be sending a message even if you do not want it to?\nWhat expression is this man making?\nVoice 1 \nThe BBC produced a special series of programs about faces called “The Human Face.” In this program they followed the story of a married couple in England called Eden and Mandy. Eden and Mandy were having a difficult time in their relationship. They fought often. They thought their marriage was probably over! But they decided to try one more thing.\nVoice 2 \nMandy and Eden flew to the United States to meet with Dr. John Gottman. Dr. Gottman is a psychologist, a scientist who studies people. The BBC’s “The Human Face” program described how Dr. Gottman attached machines to Eden and Mandy. He asked Eden and Mandy to talk to each other. As they talked, Dr. Gottman and his team of scientists observed how Eden and Mandy’s bodies changed while they talked.\nVoice 1 \nDr. Gottman found that arguing was hurting Eden and Mandy’s relationship. But he also believed there was more. Their facial expressions were making things worse! As they fought, Eden and Mandy began to exchange looks of disgust and contempt. These expressions communicate hate and a lack of respect. Eden and Mandy never said they hated each other. But their facial expressions were communicating the message even without words.\nVoice 2 \nThis might make you think about your own facial expressions. What are you communicating with your face? Can you see what other people are communicating with their faces? Experts say that facial expressions are not always the same between cultures. For example, people in one culture may use their eyes more to communicate a message. They will notice when the eyes are more open or closed. They will notice the lines around the other person’s eyes. Reading a person’s face is something we just do. We do not think about it.\nVoice 1 \nHowever, experts say there are at least seven facial expressions that everyone on earth can recognize. They are universal expressions. These expressions are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, contempt, and disgust. You can probably easily imagine what each of these expressions look like. You do not need language to communicate these feelings – your face can communicate them for you – whether you want it to or not!\n7 Universal Facial ExpressionsBy Icerko Lýdia – Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25584633\nVoice 2 \nHave you ever been around a baby? If you have, you know that making funny faces will usually make a baby react, and maybe even laugh. Babies love to see different faces. When does this ability to recognize different facial expressions appear?\nVoice 1 \nMany scientists have studied how babies react to faces. We do know that babies recognize faces very soon after they are born. In 1974, researchers studied babies who were about nine minutes old. They showed the babies a picture of a face, a picture of shapes, or an empty page. When researchers moved the picture, they observed the babies. Researchers found that babies looked at the picture of a face longer than the other pictures.\nImage by ursula_irwin from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nEven a few hours after they are born, babies will recognize their mother’s face. They will look at their mother’s face longer than they look at another woman’s face. After a few days, babies can see the difference between a sad or happy face. They begin to copy the expression on a face. And around five months later, babies can recognize that a sad voice goes with a sad face.\nVoice 1 \nResearchers do not know exactly why or how babies develop these abilities so quickly. It may be that this is an important skill for survival. Babies around eight months old begin to change their behavior based on their mothers’ facial expressions. In one study, researchers looked at one-year-olds. They wanted the babies to walk down a small incline. When the mothers smiled at the babies, the babies walked down the small hill. But when the mothers frowned, the babies did not go down.\nVoice 2 \nOur faces communicate a lot of information — at every age! We can use our faces to give a message. And we can understand what people are thinking just by seeing their face. Researchers try to understand why we need these skills. Some experts say that people who are good at reading faces have a better chance at building relationships, getting a job, and working well with others. That is, our faces help us to be a part of a community. They connect us with other people.\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever thought about what your face communicates to others? What does your face show?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nMarina Cantacuzino is a news writer. In 2003, she started a project that changed her life. For many months, Marina worked with an artist named Brian Moody. Together, they met with individuals that had been affected by crime. Some of the people were victims of crimes. Other people were criminals. Brian took pictures of each person. Marina asked each person to tell their story. These stories were about terrible pain, loss, and regret. But they were also about forgiveness.\nVoice 2 \nMarina and Brian gathered these stories and pictures together. With them, they created an exhibit or public art show. They called the exhibit “The F Word.” It used the words and images of the people to show that forgiveness is complex. This exhibit led Marina to start an organization called “The Forgiveness Project.” Today’s Spotlight is on The Forgiveness Project and the power of spreading forgiveness around the world.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2004, The F Word exhibit opened in London, England. Many people came and saw it. Soon, other cities wanted to show the exhibit too.  So, the exhibit started travelling around the world. People in over 350 places saw The F Word show. Marina wrote about two main ways people reacted to the exhibit.\nVoice 3 \n“There are people who see forgiveness as a very honorable and humble way to react to terrible events. And then there are those who simply laugh at it. For the first group, forgiveness is a strong value. It is strong enough to end generations of trouble caused by revenge – when people choose to hurt those who hurt them. But for the second group, forgiveness is just a weak answer. This group feels that forgiveness lets the violator go free and only encourages more violence.”\nPhoto by Kerri Shaver\nVoice 2 \nMarina learned a lot about forgiveness through her work on the exhibit. She discovered that forgiving is not easy for anyone. Talking about forgiveness causes strong emotions – both in people who choose to forgive and in people who do not forgive. Marina saw that forgiveness was a process that only worked if people freely chose it.  She also recognized that it had the power to transform or completely change difficult situations.  This power and the popularity of the exhibit caused Marina to start The Forgiveness Project.\nVoice 1 \nThe goal of The Forgiveness Project is “to build a better future by healing the wounds of the past”.  They do this by encouraging discussion and education about forgiveness. They also work to spread positive stories of forgiveness.\nVoice 2 \nOne part of the project is its prison program. This program is designed to teach prisoners about forgiveness and help keep them from doing more crimes in the future. The Forgiveness Project also works in schools. It provides materials that help students explore ideas about forgiveness.  It also teaches students about conflict resolution.\nVoice 1 \nThe Forgiveness Project also has a special place on its website where it collects stories from men and women all over the world. This collection of stories shows how complex forgiveness is. For example, consider the stories of Tracey Ford and Mariane Pearl.\nVoice 2 \nTracey Ford believes in forgiveness – even in the worst situations. And in 2007 her belief was tested. Her son Andre was 17. He went to a friend’s birthday party. When he was there, criminals shot guns at the party crowd. They shot Andre two times and murdered him. The police did not find the people who killed Andre. And yet, Tracey says she forgives the people who killed her son. She told The Forgiveness Project:\nVoice 4 \n“Forgiveness is not saying that what happened was okay. It is being able to say in your heart that you accept what has happened. And you will not let it stop you living a life or seeing humanity in the person who has hurt you.”\nPhoto by Jon Flobrant\nVoice 1 \nBut Mariane Pearl feels differently about forgiveness. Mariane lived in Pakistan with her husband. In 2002, her husband was murdered by a terrorist group. She told The Forgiveness Project that she could not forgive her husband’s killer. But she also did not want revenge. She did not want to hurt him in return. Instead, she wanted the court system to provide justice. She describes her feelings on The Forgiveness Project website.\nVoice 5 \n“Revenge is a basic human desire. It is the animal part of man. It gets us nowhere… But forgiveness lacks substance as an answer to extreme situations…You have to win some sort of victory over the people who have hurt you. You can only do that by denying the terrorists their goal. They try to kill everything in you… The only way to oppose them is by demonstrating the strength they think they have taken from you. That strength is to keep on living, to keep on valuing life.”\nVoice 2 \nAs Mariane’s story demonstrates, it is difficult to talk about forgiveness without talking about justice. So, The Forgiveness Project encourages people to seek restorative justice. This kind of justice works to build relationships between victims and the criminals who hurt them.  Restorative justice also identifies ways to repair harm when possible. Matthew James’ story is a good example of restorative justice.\nVoice 1 \nMatthew is from England. One day, while Matthew was at work, someone entered his house. This person stole his things and left. Matthew was angry. A few weeks later, the same robber can back to Matthew’s home. Now Matthew felt unsafe. He felt like he could not protect himself or his girlfriend. After a month, the police arrested the man who entered Matthew’s house. His name was Billy.\nVoice 2 \nSoon after, a police officer invited Matthew to meet Billy. Matthew decided to go to the prison and talk with Billy. But he was not the only person there. Other victims Billy hurt were there too. Billy told Matthew and the others about his past. Then, the victims talked about how they were hurt by Billy’s actions. Matthew saw a change in Billy. Billy could now see how his actions had hurt real people like Matthew. Matthew told The Forgiveness Project,\nVoice 6 \n“When I left the prison I recognized that things had changed for me. I changed from being a victim of crime to being able to see things from Billy’s side. Some kind of balance had returned.”\nVoice 1 \nForgiveness looks different in every situation. For some people, it requires justice. For others, it is a process of grace. Some people can only forgive if the criminal shows regret for his actions. Others can forgive without even knowing the criminal. For some it means every day deciding to forgive again. Even though people may experience and describe forgiveness differently, Marina Cantacuzino believes it always has power. She writes,\nVoice 3 \n“Forgiveness is difficult, costly and painful. But it has the possible ability to completely change a person.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Courtney Schutt. The producer was Ryan Geertsma. The voices you heard were from the United States and the United Kingdom. All quotes were adapted and voiced by Spotlight.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nAs humans, we do some strange things. We jump out of airplanes. We make enough bombs to blow up the whole world. We invent sports and then spend much of our lives playing or watching them. We cry during sad films even though we know the actors are not really dying. But it can be the small, common things humans do that are really the most strange.\nVoice 2  \nFor example, two people are in love. They like to spend time together. They feel good when they are together. They share many interests. They have similar goals for the future. But here is the strange thing. One way they show each other love is to take their mouths and press them together. They may even put their tongues into each other’s mouth! They may even do this for a long time. Today’s Spotlight is on kissing!\nVoice 1  \nWhat is a kiss? Have you ever thought about it? Have you thought about all the different kisses you might give, or someone might give you?\nVoice 2  \nThere are three main kinds of kisses. First, there are kisses between parents and children. Kisses for children should be short, non-sexual, and on appropriate places like heads and hands. These kisses help children understand they are special and loved.\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon\nVoice 1\nSecond, there are kisses of greeting. These kinds of kisses are different from country to country. They are governed by the rules of that culture. For example, in Argentina, when two people meet, they give each other a kiss on the right side of the face — the cheek. But it is usually not a real kiss. The cheeks touch and they make a small kissing sound. No lips or mouths touch at all.\nVoice 2  \nIn some places of Italy, people greet with not one, but two cheek kisses. They first kiss one side. Then they kiss the other side. In the Netherlands, people kiss three times: first one side, then the other, then back to the first side. And some places have even more complex rules about greeting kisses. People in many countries in the Middle East greet each other with a kiss. But this is not appropriate between everyone. An unmarried man and unmarried woman should not kiss. So what do you do if you are travelling and don’t know what to do? A good rule is: if you do not know what to do, do not kiss.\nVoice 1  \nBut there is one more kind of kiss. And it is far more complex than the first two. The third kind of kiss is the romantic kiss. But what is romantic about it? Noam Shpancer teaches psychology at Otterbein University. In Psychology Today, he wrote,\nPhoto by AndriyKo Podilnyk\nVoice 3  \n“One must admit that kissing is more than a bit strange. Why would the exchange of mouth fluids and left over pieces of food be a good thing, even a sign of passionate love? The romantic kiss is very common. So it must play an important part in the dance of human sexuality. But what exactly is that part?”\nVoice 2  \nScientists do not agree about why people kiss when they are in love. But there are many ideas. The first idea is that kissing helps us understand other people in a chemical way. When we kiss someone we get close to them. We smell their body and their breath. We taste their mouth. We feel their face. The fluids in their mouth carry chemical signals that may communicate to our brain if they are a good mate.\nVoice 1  \nMost animals do not kiss. But they are much better at smelling things than humans. Humans need to be much closer to each other to smell. Melissa Hogenboom wrote for BBC.com,\nVoice 4  \n“Humans have a terrible sense of smell. We learn a lot from getting close. Smell is not the only way we measure someone as a mate. But studies have shown that smell is an important part in choosing a mate.”\nVoice 2  \nWhen we kiss another person, we bring them close to us. We show them that we trust them. We accept any sickness they may have. A kiss creates closeness between people. Shpancer explains this.\nVoice 3  \n“Kissing appears to have two main uses. In the short-term, the kiss is more sexual. It serves as a tool for choosing a good sexual partner. In the long-term the kiss expresses a connection between people. It is a way to keep and build feelings of closeness in the relationship.”\nVoice 1  \nBut not everyone likes kissing. For some people, this is a personal choice. Some people do not like to be touched. They do not like the idea of sharing mouth fluids with another person. There are also general differences between men and women. Men may think kissing should lead to sex. Women are more likely to think kissing is a way to connect with another person.\nVoice 2  \nKissing is not part of every culture. If you watch films and television, it is easy to believe that romantic kissing is part of life everywhere in the world. But a study published in American Anthropologist shows that kissing is not as common as people may believe. Lindsey Bever wrote about this study for The Washington Post. She wrote,\nVoice 5  \n“Researchers at the University of Nevada and Indiana University found fewer than half of the world’s cultures kiss in a romantic way. Many cultures do consider kissing to be a romantic or sexual act. But, other cultures have called kissing ‘gross’, something to make them sick. They ask why anyone would ‘share their dinner’.”\nVoice 1  \nA kiss means different things to different people. It could be something that is strange and unwelcome. It could mean, “Hello, nice to meet you”. Or it could mean, “I love you and want to be with you forever”. But at its most simple, kissing is just one way that some people express their love.\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon\nVoice 2  \nWhat do you think about kissing? Is kissing part of your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever agreed to meet a friend for a meal? Imagine this. You arrived early and got a good table. You waited. And waited. Now she is almost 30 minutes late. You begin to worry. What if something happened? What if she is hurt and needs help? You send her a message asking if everything is ok. She says that everything is fine. You ask if she is going to be there soon. She messages back, “I forgot!”\nVoice 2  \nYou sit there for a minute. You do not feel good about what happened. But what can you say? Anyone can forget a meeting. What really makes you angry is that your friend did not say “I am sorry.” Today’s Spotlight is on when, why, and how people say, “I am sorry.”\nVoice 1  \nPeople apologize in many different ways and for different reasons. Some people say “sorry” more often than other people. And saying sorry is also cultural. People in some cultures apologize more than people in different cultures. For example, many people believe that people from Canada apologize more often than people from the United States. And people from Britain and Japan apologize a lot each day. In fact, in Japan, there are over 20 different ways to apologize.\nVoice 2  \nPeople say “I am sorry” for many different reasons. Some people will say it if they walk into you on the street.\n“Oops! Sorry!”\nVoice 1  \nOther people will say it after they say or do something that is not nice.\n“I’m sorry.”\nVoice 2  \nPeople say sorry if they need your help.\n“Sorry, can you help me?”\nVoice 1  \nOr they may say sorry when something bad happened to another person – even if they had nothing to do with it.\n“I am sorry that happened to you.”\nVoice 2  \nPeople even say “I’m sorry” about the weather!\n“Sorry it’s so cold today!”\nVoice 1  \nIn many of these cases, saying sorry is easy. But what if you hurt someone you love? Why is it sometimes so difficult to say? Telling someone, “I am sorry” should be easy. It is just words! It does not cost any money. It does not require great skill or education. Then why can it be so difficult to do?\nPhoto by Nadine Shaabana\nVoice 2  \nPeople find all sorts of reasons to avoid saying “I am sorry”. They justify what they did. That is, they explain how it was the best thing to do. Sometimes a person who should say sorry only sees what the other person did. They point out what that person did wrong. People do this because saying that you are sorry means admitting that you hurt someone else. People do not like to feel guilty.\nVoice 1  \nBut telling someone “I am sorry” is an important step in fixing relationships. Aaron Lazare is a psychiatrist who studied what an apology – saying sorry – can do. In an article for Psychology Today he wrote,\nVoice 3  \n“I am always amazed by how many of my friends and patients of all kinds hold on to anger for years. It cuts through their own lives and the lives of family and friends. So many of these things could have been avoided or healed with a real apology.”\nVoice 2  \nBut what is a real apology? Many experts say there is more to a good apology than just saying the words “I am sorry”. There are several steps. The first step is to admit that you did something wrong. Be clear, not general. Name what you did. For example, do not say, “I am sorry I hurt you.” Instead, say, “I am sorry that I broke your glasses.”\nVoice 1  \nYou need to do this to show that you understand how your actions affected the other person. You need to explain that you understand their pain.\nVoice 2  \nNext, you need to admit responsibility. You can explain why you did what you did. You can tell the other person that you were not trying to hurt them. But try to imagine what the other person is feeling. And take responsibility for what you did.\nVoice 1  \nFinally, you need to tell the person that you will not do that thing again. Explain how you will change your behavior. This can help them rebuild the trust in your relationship. But make sure you honor your promise to change. You need to say, “I am sorry” But you need to prove it as well.\nVoice 2  \nAlso remember that sometimes, one apology is not enough. Sometimes, when a person is hurt very badly, or has lost their trust in you, it may take a long time for them to accept your apology and forgive you.\nVoice 1  \nHere is an example of what an apology like this could sound like. Imagine the situation from the beginning of this program. You are meeting a friend, and she forgot your meeting. Your friend could apologize like this:\nVoice 4  \n“I am sorry that I did not meet you at the restaurant. It was not kind of me to leave you waiting. Next time I will make sure to set a reminder on my mobile phone so that I do not forget. I hope you will forgive me.”\nPhoto by Dario Valenzuela\nVoice 2  \nMany people think that saying “I am sorry” is a sign of weakness. But Aaron Lazare disagrees. He writes,\nVoice 3  \n“An apology is a show of strength. It is an act of honesty because we admit we did wrong. It is an act of generosity because we are giving worth to the people we hurt. It offers hope for a new relationship, possibly even a stronger one. The apology communicates that we are serious about the relationship. Saying “I am sorry” is an act of courage because it opens us up to shame and the risk of feeling stupid, being rejected, and experiencing new pain from the person we hurt.”\nVoice 1  \nSaying I’m sorry is often difficult. But it is worth the pain for a better relationship. What about you? Have you ever had to say “I am sorry”? Was it easy or difficult? What would have happened if you did not say it?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nImagine a family with three children. Maria is the oldest, David is the second child and Tom is the youngest. One day, their father told them some bad news – he lost his job. Maria was worried. She told her father that she would work to make money for the family. David put his arms around his father and told him that everything would be fine. Tom was sad – his father had promised him new shoes for football. How would he get them now?\nVoice 2 \nWhy did Maria, David and Tom all react differently to their father’s news? Why are children from the same family often so different from one another?  Dr. Alfred Adler had a theory about this. He worked as a doctor in Austria one hundred years ago. He was very interested in the qualities of a person’s character or personality. Dr. Adler thought that the order that children were born into their families affected their personalities. Today’s Spotlight is on Adler’s birth order theory.\nPhoto by Ben Wicks\nVoice 1 \nThere are four possible birth order positions within a family. A child may be the oldest, the youngest or the middle child. Other families have only one child with no brothers or sisters. Birth order theory says that our birth order influences what kind of person we each become.\nVoice 2 \nFrank Sulloway is a writer and family expert at the University of Calfornia, Berkeley. He believes that birth order affects personality and behavior. He talked to TIME magazine about it. He said that people develop this way for reasons of survival. If a family has more than one child, the children must compete for the parents’ time and resources – resources like food. Frank Sulloway says that people may not recognize that they are working for survival. But it is part of our natural desires. Sulloway says:\nVoice 3            \n“Siblings are much smarter than scientists. They are always trying to define their place in the family. They try to get the most resources out of their parents.”\nVoice 1 \nChildren in each birth position have a different way to gain an advantage in the family. Here are some of the main characters of personality by birth order:\nVoice 2 \nThe first born or oldest child often gets more time with her parents. Think about our story from the beginning of this program. When Maria was born, she had no other siblings to compete for food or time. A first born child, like Maria, often wants to please her parents. She often takes control and responsibility in social situations. She may try to be perfect and do everything correctly. Jeffrey Kluger is a writer. He wrote a book about brothers and sisters. He described the character of an oldest child to the news station NPR:\nVoice 4  \n“It is often true that oldest children will be the most successful. They will be the ones who earn the most. They will be the ones who are most loyal to the family, most driven to achieve in traditional ways. They will also be the tallest, even if it is only by a few centimeters. They often have higher tested intelligence than the second-born.”\nVoice 1 \nThe last born or youngest child, like Tom, is used to other people providing for him. He may be more concerned about himself than about other people. But Tom is also very friendly. He likes to make other people laugh with jokes and funny behavior. As the youngest, this is often the best way for him to get other people to notice him.\nVoice 2 \nDavid is an example of a middle child. He can sometimes feel left out. He does not get the advantages of being the oldest or the youngest. The middle child often develops skills in the arts, such as music or painting. Some middle children become competitive and even rebel against their parents. But many of them, like David, make peace in the family. As a middle child David has learned to work well with other people.\nVoice 1 \nThe last birth order position is the only child. With no brothers or sisters she often gets whatever she wants! She does not have any competition for her parents’ time or resources. The only child often uses language very well because she spends so much time with adults. She can also feel a lot of pressure as the only child. This can make her competitive and hard-working.\nPhoto by Charlein Gracia\nVoice 2 \nDo these personalities fit you and your family? Some people find that birth order theory describes them very well. Other people say the theory cannot be tested and does not work. There are many other variables or different situations that may change the effects of birth order on personality.\nVoice 1 \nThese variables include the sex and age of each child and the number of brothers and sisters. Culture and education also make a difference. So does the amount of money that the family has. The experiences of the family can also change how birth order affects personality. For example, some children are adopted, not born into, their family. Families also change as a result of sickness, death or divorce of the parents.\nVoice 2 \nSome children may also need different treatment because of disabilities or medical needs – and this can affect the other children in the family. Dianna Anderson, a producer for Spotlight, gives an example. She has two older brothers, and one is disabled. Dianna says,\nVoice 5 \n“Birth order is very different in my family. Because my oldest brother is disabled, my middle brother is much more like a first child. I am in between a middle child and a youngest child. My middle brother is very smart and is very serious about his work. I work very hard too but I also love to make people laugh. Having a disabled first child changed how our parents treated the rest of their children.”\nVoice 1 \nThere are many different variables that influence people’s personalities and actions. Birth order is just one interesting theory. And, as Frank Sullaway told ABC news:\nVoice 3 \n“Humans are complex. You can find things that are more important than birth order. But that does not mean that birth order is not something we can learn from.”\nVoice 2 \nHas birth order affected your personality? We want to hear your family stories!

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nA woman in the United States is making a meal. She chooses a recipe from a recipe book. She will follow this recipe, adding each different food at the right time to make a good-tasting meal. The recipe begins with common foods. First, she adds some juice from a sour lemon. Then she puts in some olive oil and a small amount of sweet honey. She adds some salt and pepper spice. Finally, she is ready to add the protein, or meat, into the meal. Does the recipe use chicken? Fish? Pork? No, the final ingredient in this recipe is katydids – a kind of insect!\nVoice 2 \nFor many people in the United States insects would be a very surprising ingredient. There, eating insects is not common. But this recipe book is trying to change the way people in the United States and other western countries think about eating insects. This book contains recipes for people to make food from insects. It is called the “Eat-A-Bug Cookbook.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this book is David George Gordon. In his book, he tells about the reasons that people should eat more insects. Eating insects is good for the environment, public health, and also the economy. Today’s Spotlight is on eating insects.\nVoice 2 \nExperts estimate that by 2050 there will be 9 billion people in the world. Almost a billion people already suffer from hunger every day. Our earth has a limited amount of resources like land and water. If we do not have enough food for the people on our earth now, how will we have enough for another 2 billion people in 2050?\nVoice 1 \nThese are the questions that experts around the world are struggling with. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a report in 2013. It explained:\nVoice 3 \n“The problem will be worse in the future. We need to think about what we eat and how we produce it. We need to find new ways of growing food.”\nVoice 2 \nThe report suggested that raising and eating insects was one way people could solve this problem. There are over 1,900 different kinds of insects that people can eat. The most common are beetles and caterpillars.\nVoice 1 \nMany people around the world already eat insects. In fact, insects are part of the traditional diet of over 2 billion people. For example, in China, some people cook insects over a fire. They put the insects on a stick. The cooked insects are served on the street as street food. They are also served in restaurants, where food costs a lot of money. In the country of Ghana, people collect the termite insect in the spring time. They grind the termites into a kind of powder similar to grain. They use the ground termites to make bread.\nVoice 2\nInsects are a part of traditional diets because they are a very healthy food. They contain almost as much protein as a serving of meat from a pig or cow. Protein is a substance all people need to eat to stay healthy. Insects are high in vitamins and minerals. And insects are also low in fat and cholesterol – substances that are necessary for the body, but only in small amounts.\nVoice 1 \nEating insects is also very good for the environment. Insects need fewer resources like land and water than larger animals. 90% of the fresh water people use goes to farming and raising animals.\nVoice 2 \nMarcel Dicke studies insects. In a TED talk, he explained how insects also produce more meat from the food they eat. For example, imagine a farmer. Imagine the farmer feeds a cow 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce about 1 pound of cow meat for people to eat. However, imagine the farmer gives cricket insects 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce 9 pounds of cricket meat for people to eat!\nVoice 1 \nEating more insects can also help people in poorer communities. Many people can raise and sell insects. Raising and selling insects can provide a job and food.\nVoice 2 \nBut insects will not replace livestock meat very quickly. First, people in some countries would have to change how they think about eating insects. Many people in North America and Europe eat a lot of livestock meat like cow and pigs. But they do not traditionally eat insects. They do eat some products of insects, like sweet honey from bees. But it is not normal to eat a whole insect in any form. In fact, for many people in the west, eating insects sounds insane! They believe insects are dirty and dangerous. Insects make people feel uncomfortable.\nVoice 1 \nSome people are trying to solve this problem. For example, we talked about David George Gordon’s recipe book at the beginning of this program. His recipe book tries to show people that eating insects can be delicious and easy. Other insect experts travel and tell people about the great effects of eating insects. But they still have a lot of work to do.\nVoice 2 \nAnother challenge is creating rules and laws for insect producers to follow. There should be rules about how to raise insects safely to eat as food. People also need to decide how to eat insects. Will they be whole? Will they be ground into powder like a grain? Or, will food scientists discover a way to take all of the great food substances from insects and serve them in a very different form? These are all questions that people will have to ask and answer in the near future.\nVoice 1 \nBut there are people who want to answer those questions now. José Andrés is a master chef in the United States. He has won important awards for his cooking. He serves insects in his restaurant. He believes that finding new forms of food is important for the future. He told the New Yorker Magazine:\nVoice 4 \n“We need to feed people in a sustainable way. In the future, the people who know how to produce protein will have an advantage over everyone else.”\nVoice 2 \nWill insects become the world’s main source of protein in the future?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight is on a food people eat all around the world. It is pizza! Very simply, pizza is a food made by putting meat and vegetables, called toppings, on top of bread. But pizza is not the same everywhere. All around the world, people enjoy different toppings on their pizzas.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nIn Brazil, green peas are popular on pizza.\nVoice 1 \nIn Japan, food from the sea, like eel and squid are popular.\nVoice 2 \nIn Costa Rica, people enjoy the coconut fruit on top of their pizzas.\nVoice 1 \nIn Italy, the bread, or crust, of the pizza may be the most important part. It can be more important than anything that goes on it!\nVoice 2 \nBut in the Netherlands toppings are very important! A popular pizza in the Netherlands is called the “Double Dutch.” It has two times the cheese, two times the onions, and two times the beef! It has two times the toppings!\nImage by Daniel Naor from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nAs you can see, there are many different ways to eat pizza. And each way is correct! The simple design of pizza is the same all over the world. But everyone likes something different on top of it. It is common for different cultures to have their own kinds of food. A food that is popular in one culture will not always be popular in another culture. But pizza seems to cross all these barriers. Pizza is popular in almost every part of the world! So, why is pizza so popular? Where did it even come from?\nVoice 2 \nNo one really knows where the idea for modern pizza started. But experts do agree that the design, or recipe, for modern pizza was probably put together using different ideas from different cultures. A few cultures already had a simple common recipe for pizza almost 2000 years ago!\nVoice 1 \nEven before that, Middle Eastern cultures had something similar to pizza. Babylonians, Israelites, and Egyptians liked to eat flat, cooked bread. They would add olive oil and good tasting spices to the bread. Then they cooked this flat, spiced bread in hot ovens made of earth or on top of hot, flat stones. It was a small food that people ate between meals. Or they added it to a meal.\nVoice 2 \nAnother version of this flat round bread was also popular in Greece. The Greeks called it “plakountos.” They put vegetables and meat on top of the flat bread.\nVoice 1 \nBut many experts believe that the version of pizza that people know best today started in the city of Naples, in Italy. It was a street food. Poor people there spent a lot of time outside of their very small homes. They could buy this food and eat it easily as they walked outside.\nVoice 2 \nOne more thing added to the creation of the modern pizza. They put tomatoes on their pizza street food. Today, this soft, red fruit is the most popular fruit in the world. But back in the 1700s, people thought it was poisonous. But that did not stop them from eating it!\nTomatoes; Image by Dapur Melodi from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nFinally, the popularity of pizza began to grow.  Shops opened where people could buy pizza. In 1830, the first pizzeria opened in Naples, Italy. This restaurant only sold pizza. But the pizza of that time still looked a little different from the modern pizza we know today. However, in 1889, Don Raffaele Esposito created the first modern pizza. Katy Blake tells the story.\nVoice 3 \nQueen Margherita Theresa was visiting Naples. She had heard of pizza, but she had never tried it. During her visit to Naples, she finally decided to try it! Don Raffaele was a famous pizza maker. She asked him to make a special pizza for her.\nSo, Don Raffaele created three pizzas. But he designed one pizza especially for the Queen. He added three toppings to the pizza. The first topping was mozzarella cheese. Mozzarella cheese was made from the milk of a water buffalo – a kind of local cow. It is a white cheese. The next topping was red tomatoes. Finally, Don Raffaele added basil leaves. Basil is a green plant with a mild spicy taste. These three toppings were white, red and green – the colors of the Italian flag. He called this pizza the Margherita Pizza. The Queen was very happy — she loved the pizza! And the Margherita Pizza is still a very popular kind of pizza today!\nImage via Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nAfter this event, people no longer considered pizza a poor person’s food. Everyone, rich or poor, enjoyed this easy-to-eat, delicious food. As people began to travel more often, they began sharing the news about pizza.\nVoice 1 \nToday, people all over the world eat more than five billion pizzas every year. The recipe for pizza has changed over the years. Today people usually make pizza by putting sauce, a kind of thick liquid, over the crust. The most popular kind of sauce is made from tomatoes. Then cheese and toppings of all kinds go on top of the sauce. But pizza makers have tried to put almost any kind of food you can imagine on top of a pizza!\nVoice 2 \nPeople all over the world have helped to create the recipe for pizza. It is a food that combines different foods from different countries. And it is probably one of the oldest foods you can think of! But one of the best things about pizza is this: you can create your own special kind of pizza. You can put anything you like on it. You can mix different foods from different cultures and create something wonderful. Who would have expected that such an ancient and simple food would be popular today? Pizza is just one example of how great things can happen when cultures come together.\nImage by Aline Ponce from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nDo you enjoy pizza?

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nA man is in his kitchen. His name is Seamus Blackley. In front of him is a large, flat wooden board. Blackley covers the board in a special powder. It is a kind of flour made from a grain called einkorn. This is one of the oldest forms of wheat. Then he takes a large ball of dough from a bowl. He begins to push and pull the dough, kneading it into a round shape. The sweet smell of bread fills the room. Then, after some time, he places the dough in an earthen tagine. And he puts it into a hot place to bake. The dough begins to bake. Soon it will be a large loaf of bread. \nVoice 2\nBut this is no ordinary bread. Blackley is making the bread with ancient grains and ancient methods. But Blackley is also using a special yeast. The yeast will make the bread rise or expand. But this yeast is not the kind people normally use. This yeast is also ancient. Using a special process, Blackley took the yeast from Egyptian baking bowls. It is the same yeast used 4,500 years ago!\nVoice 1\nYeast is one of the most important ingredients ever discovered. People use it to make bread, alcoholic drinks, and fermented foods. People have been using yeast for almost 10,000 years! Today’s Spotlight is on the history of yeast. \nVoice 2\nYeast is not an ordinary ingredient, like salt or pepper, or sugar or flour. Yeast is a very small living organism. It is a kind of fungus, related to mushrooms. You cannot see it unless you look at it through a microscope. Yeast feeds on sugars. When yeast eats these sugars, it produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is called fermentation. Carbon dioxide is what causes bread to rise. And the alcohol gives bread its special flavour. \nVoice 1\nThere are hundreds of different kinds of yeast. Some are useful for making food. But others do not work as well. One popular kind of yeast makes a bread called sourdough. Sourdough has a special, tart flavour. Other yeasts make alcoholic beverages. Koji is a yeast used in Japan. The Japanese use it to make a drink called Sake. But there are even yeasts that people do not use much. These are called wild yeasts. \nVoice 2\nHumans first started using yeast in food before people invented writing. Experts think the first use of yeast was probably an accident. Wild yeast probably fell into a sweet drink. And the drink started to ferment. When people tasted it, they found it was good. So, they took some of the drink, and used it to make more. They were taking yeast and growing more, though they did not know it. These were the first brewers. \nVoice 1\nFrom this point, yeast began to change. People began breeding the yeast. If they made something that they liked, they would repeat the process. And they started breeding different yeasts for different things. The yeast began to specialize. Kevin Verstrepen is a scientist at the University of Leuven. He studies yeast genetics. He spoke to Science Daily about this process. \nVoice 3\n“Sometimes, early brewers had a very good fermentation. They were smart enough to harvest the yeast. They used it to start the next batch, even if they did not know what was in it. Reusing the yeast to make beer separated it from nature. The yeasts were changing in the brewery.”\nVoice 2\nRemember Seamus Blackley from the beginning of this program? When Blackley started making his bread, he was excited because of these changes. The Egyptian yeast was a lot like sourdough bread. But what was yeast like almost five thousand years ago? Blackley did not know what it would taste like. When he finally tasted his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter about his experience.\nVoice 4\n“The bread is light and full of air, especially for a loaf made from these ingredients. The smell and flavour are incredible. It is very different. You can easily tell the difference, even if you are not excited about bread.”\nVoice 1\nThe first evidence of people using yeast comes from China. The ancient Chinese made a drink called Kui. They used water, honey, rice, and fruit. Drinks made with yeast had a lot of advantages. Of course, people liked the effects of alcohol. But drinks made with yeast were also safer than water. In ancient times, drinking water could be dangerous. It could make a person sick very easily. But alcohol kills many of the diseases that live in water. So, you could drink it without getting sick. Many civilizations used this to their advantage. In ancient Greece, people mixed water with strong wine. This killed the bacteria in the water. And, because it was mixed, they could drink it most of the day without being drunk. \nVoice 2\nBut making foods with yeast also makes them more delicious and healthier. These are fermented foods. The yeast breaks down sugars that may be difficult to digest. Kefir is a fermented drink made from milk. It is from Eastern Europe. For most people, milk is very difficult to digest after childhood. This is because of a sugar called lactose, which most people cannot digest. But the yeast in Kefir breaks lactose down. Because of this, Kefir has almost no lactose in it. The yeast makes milk safe for people who cannot drink milk!\nVoice 1\nMany ancient people also used yeast to help in food storage. Fermenting foods in this way is called pickling. Fermenting, or pickling, makes food last longer. But it also changes the flavor. Kimchi is one of the most famous pickled foods from Korea. Kimchi is fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radish. In ancient times, people made kimchi so that these vegetables would last through the winter. But soon, people began to make kimchi because they liked the taste. \nVoice 2\nToday, we do not need yeast to clean water or to preserve food. But over the years, humans have developed a taste for fermented foods. We eat them now because we like them! We continue to make them because they are part of our traditions. And they connect us to people who lived thousands of years ago. When he made his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter:\nVoice 4\n“This is very exciting. I am so amazed that it worked. It is such a magical thing. We can share food in a rather genuine way with our distant ancestors.” \nVoice 1\nDo you use yeast in your diet? What fermented foods do you eat? Do you make any yourself?

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nSome people drink it with food in the afternoon.  \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it to give themselves energy in the morning.  \nVoice 1\nSome people drink it as part of a ceremony.  \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it when they are sick.  \nVoice 1\nSome people drink it hot. \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it very cold.  \nVoice 1\nPeople have been drinking it for hundreds of years, in hundreds of countries. What is it? Tea!\nVoice 2\nTea comes from the camemellia senensis plant. People pick the leaves off the plant. They set the leaves to dry. The tea leaves are ready when all the water from the leaves is evaporated.  There are many ways to prepare the leaves before making the tea drink. Some tea leaves are left open to the air before they are dried. This makes the leaves darker. They will taste stronger. Some people mix tea leaves with flowers, oils, and other plants to give teas different tastes. The people who originally discovered tea developed these methods many years ago.\nVoice 1\nThe story of tea begins in China. Chinese history says that over five thousand years ago, Chinese emperor Shen Nung discovered tea. Stories say that a dry leaf from the tea plant fell into the emperor’s cup of hot water. The emperor saw that his water turned dark. He tasted the water and liked it. This was the first cup of tea.\nVoice 2\nHowever it started, tea became very popular in China. People believed that tea was healthy. People in China also created many different ways to prepare tea. In fact, a man named Lu Yu wrote a book just about tea, late in the eighth century.\nVoice 1\nShortly after this, tea travelled to Japan. Japanese Buddhist priests travelled to China. And they brought tea back with them. In Japan, people developed special ceremonies to serve tea. Serving tea became a new form of art. It was most common among wealthy people.\nVoice 2\nTea was an important part of both Chinese and Japanese culture. It had travelled to other Asian countries too. But tea had not yet travelled anywhere else in the world. Finally, in the late fifteen hundreds, Portuguese travellers brought small amounts of tea back to Europe. Portugal was one of the first European countries to trade with China. Portugal worked with the Netherlands to move the tea through Europe. Dutch ships took tea to France and other countries on the Baltic Sea.\nVoice 1\nOnly very wealthy people had enough money to drink tea in Europe. It took many months to transport the tea from Asia. And only a limited amount was transported. But more countries started to trade with China. They also brought tea back to Europe. Prices became lower, and more people could drink tea.\nVoice 2\nToday, England is the European country most known for tea. British traders started shipping tea to England in the late 1600s.Tea trade had become a very profitable business. England imported about 18,000 kilograms of tea a year in 1699. Ten years later, the country imported six times that amount of tea!\nVoice 1\nBritish colonists also brought tea wherever they settled. Tea became very important in India. It is still a very important crop there. And Indian tea is known around the world.\nVoice 2\nTea played an important part in one British colony you might know. This colony is now known as the United States of America. England sent tea to America. But, as time went on, England raised the taxes on the tea and other goods it sent. The people living in the colonies did not like these taxes. To protest the high taxes, a group of colonists took a large shipment of tea and threw it into the ocean. Today, this event is known as “The Boston Tea Party”. It was one of the most important events in the American Revolution.\nVoice 1\nTea has also changed over many years. In the past, people drank tea by putting the leaves directly into the water. But around 1908 an American inventor developed a new method – tea bags. Thomas Sullivan put the tea in a small silk bag. This bag of tea could be put directly into the hot water.\nVoice 2\nAt first people in Britain did not like tea bags. But, during World War Two, people could not get their normal tea. So they had to use tea bags. Today most tea bags are made of paper. And they are very popular in many parts of the world.  \nVoice 1\nToday, people on every continent drink tea. But people in different places drink tea differently. In the United Kingdom, tea became part of the daily meal.\nVoice 2\nTraditionally, two meals involved tea in British homes. These meals became popular in the 1600s [sixteen hundreds]. The first was afternoon tea – or “low tea.” This was popular among wealthy people. They would drink tea and eat small sandwiches of meat and bread. This meal happened around three o-clock in the afternoon. The other meal was called “high tea.” High tea was a larger meal eaten later in the night. It was popular among poorer people.\nVoice 1\nIn Western Asia and the Middle East, a popular way to enjoy tea is as Masala Chai. Masala Chai is a drink made from black tea. But this drink has sugar, spices and milk in it. \nVoice 2\nAround the world people boil plants and flowers to make drinks similar to tea. These are called tisanes. A tisane is any drink made from hot water and any plant material, except from the tea plant. They are also often called herbal teas.\nVoice 1\nIn areas of South America people enjoy a particular tisane. The drink is called Mate. People make it from the leaves of the yerba mate plant. A person puts dry yerba mate leaves into a dry gourd. This is a container made from a dried vegetable skin. He then adds water to the gourd. He drinks the liquid through a thin metal tube – a bombilla.\nVoice 2\nPeople in Southern Africa make a drink called rooibos. This hot drink is made similar to tea. But instead of tea leaves, it uses the leaves from the rooibos plant. The drink is a red color and is often called red tea.  \nVoice 1\nHowever you drink tea, the next time you have a cup, think of all the people around the world who are joining you!

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nImagine the inside of a laboratory. Men and women in white lab coats bend over long tables. One woman is working over a small plastic dish. She takes a small container of liquid and empties it into the dish. Then, she squeezes several drops of a different liquid from a long tube. She seals the dish, and places it in a container with several more dishes.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nSix weeks pass. The dishes sit in their container. But inside the dishes, something is happening. Slowly, a red substance starts to grow. By the end of the six weeks, it fills the dish. It looks like a hamburger! But does it taste like one? The woman returns to the laboratory and chooses one dish. She brings it into a kitchen and places the substance on a hot pan. Once it is brown, she puts it between two pieces of bread. Then, she takes a big bite!\nVoice 1\nThis may seem like something from a futuristic film. But the woman has just taken her first bite of lab-grown, or in vitro, meat. Many people think this new technology can help solve many problems in the world of meat production. But will people really eat it? Today’s Spotlight is on in vitro meat.\nVoice 2\nMany people around the world love meat. People eat pigs, chicken, cows, goats, and many other animals. Meat is an important part of the world’s diet. For some, meals with meat are important to who they are. Many regional foods depend on meat for their uniqueness.\nVoice 1\nBut there is also a big problem with meat. Raising animals takes up a lot of space, food, and water. And the global population is increasing. As more people come to live on the earth, they will demand more meat. But the earth may not have enough space to keep these animals. \nVoice 2\nRaising livestock animals also has a serious effect on climate change. Some animals, like cows, goats, and sheep, have special stomachs. These stomachs allow them to eat foods that are very hard to digest, like grasses and leaves. But digesting these foods produces a lot of methane gas. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. It traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide. And the global meat industry is responsible for 30 percent of the world’s methane production! If the world continues to produce meat like this, it could be very bad for the environment.\nVoice 1\nFor some people, growing meat in laboratories may be the solution to this problem. Meat grown with this method is usually called cultured meat, lab-grown meat, or in vitro meat. To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.\nVoice 3\n“Cultured meat could address all the problems related to industrial meat production. It addresses environmental impacts and concerns about treating animals well. It stops the risks of getting diseases from animals. It can do all this while making sure there is a production system to meet the growth in demand for animal protein.”\nVoice 2\nFor people like Specht, in vitro meat could solve many of our problems. But the technology for in vitro meat is still very new. And it is still very expensive. Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce. But a meal of this chicken will cost about 17 dollars.\nVoice 1\nThe process also may not be as environmentally friendly as people thought. Growing in vitro meat uses a lot of energy. Some of this energy will come from burning fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. And it lasts in the atmosphere longer than methane. So, many people say it is worse for the planet in the long-term.\nVoice 2\nGrowing in vitro meat may also cause a lot of waste. This is because cell cultures must be sterile. They must be free of any bacteria. Otherwise, other things will grow, and ruin the meat. These sterile containers also create a lot of plastic waste. And there is already a problem of too much plastic waste in the environment. \nVoice 1\nBut the biggest question about in vitro meat might be: will people eat it? Many people do not trust food grown in a lab. In vitro meat may seem unnatural. Or people might fear that it will somehow affect their bodies in a bad way. And in vitro meat also does not taste like meat from animals. It does not have fat, only muscle. Fat must be added later, and the taste is still not quite the same.\nVoice 2\nStill, in vitro meat is coming. Today, it is available in very few places. But dozens of companies are working on their meat growing methods. Companies have invested billions of dollars in this research. And many people believe that it is the protein of the future. Josh Tetrick is the CEO of Eat Just, which grows in vitro chicken. He told the website CNET.\nVoice 4\n“I want tens of thousands of restaurants to have cultured meat on their menu. Then, at some point, I want them to ask their chefs, ‘why do we have conventional chicken on the menu, too?’”\nVoice 1\nWould you eat in vitro meat? Why, or why not?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nSome people drink it with food in the afternoon.\nVoice 2  \nSome people drink it to give themselves energy in the morning.\nVoice 1  \nSome people drink it as part of a ceremony.\nVoice 2  \nSome people drink it when they are sick.\nVoice 1  \nSome people drink it hot.\nVoice 2  \nSome people drink it very cold.\nVoice 1  \nPeople have been drinking it for hundreds of years, in hundreds of countries. What is it? Tea!\nVoice 2  \nTea comes from the camellia sinensis plant. People pick the leaves off the plant. They set the leaves to dry. The tea leaves are ready when all the water from the leaves is evaporated. There are many ways to prepare the leaves before making the tea drink. Some tea leaves are left open to the air before they are dried. This makes the leaves darker. They will taste stronger. Some people mix tea leaves with flowers, oils, and other plants to give teas different tastes. The people who originally discovered tea developed these methods many years ago.\nVoice 1  \nThe story of tea begins in China. Chinese history says that over 5,000 years ago, Chinese emperor Shen Nung discovered tea. Stories say that a dry leaf from the tea plant fell into the emperor’s cup of hot water. The emperor saw that his water turned dark. He tasted the water and liked it. This was the first cup of tea.\nVoice 2  \nHowever it started, tea became very popular in China. People believed that tea was healthy. People in China also created many different ways to prepare tea. In fact, a man named Lu Yu wrote a book just about tea, late in the eighth century.\nVoice 1  \nSoon after this, tea travelled to Japan. Japanese Buddhist priests travelled to China. And they brought tea back with them. In Japan, people developed special ceremonies to serve tea. Serving tea became a new form of art. It was most common among wealthy people.\nVoice 2  \nTea was an important part of both Chinese and Japanese culture. It had travelled to other Asian countries too. But tea had not yet travelled anywhere else in the world. Finally, in the late 1500s, Portuguese travellers brought small amounts of tea back to Europe. Portugal was one of the first European countries to trade with China. Portugal worked with the Netherlands to move the tea through Europe. Dutch ships took tea to France and other countries on the Baltic Sea.\nVoice 1  \nOnly very wealthy people had enough money to drink tea in Europe. It took many months to transport the tea from Asia. And only a limited amount was transported. But more countries started to trade with China. They also brought tea back to Europe. Prices became lower, and more people could drink tea.\nVoice 2  \nToday, England is the European country most known for tea. British traders started shipping tea to England in the late 1600s. Tea trade had become a very profitable business. England imported about 18,000 kilograms of tea a year in 1699. Ten years later, the country imported six times that amount of tea!\nVoice 1  \nBritish colonists also brought tea wherever they settled. Tea became very important in India. It is still a very important crop there. And Indian tea is known around the world.\nVoice 2  \nTea played an important part in one British colony you might know. This colony is now known as the United States of America. England sent tea to America. But as time went on, England raised the taxes on the tea and other goods it sent. The people living in the colonies did not like these taxes. To protest the high taxes, a group of colonists took a large shipment of tea and threw it into the ocean. Today, this event is known as “The Boston Tea Party”. It was one of the most important events in the American Revolution.\nVoice 1  \nTea has also changed over many years. In the past, people drank tea by putting the leaves directly into the water. But around 1908, an American inventor developed a new method – tea bags. Thomas Sullivan put the tea in a small silk bag. This bag of tea could be put directly into the hot water.\nVoice 2  \nAt first people, in Britain did not like tea bags. But during World War II, people could not get their normal tea. So they had to use tea bags. Today most tea bags are made of paper. And they are very popular in many parts of the world.\nVoice 1  \nToday, people on every continent drink tea. But people in different places drink tea differently. In the United Kingdom, tea became part of the daily meal.\nVoice 2  \nTraditionally, two meals involved tea in British homes. These meals became popular in the 1600s. The first was afternoon tea – or “low tea”. This was popular among wealthy people. They would drink tea and eat small sandwiches of meat and bread. This meal happened around three o-clock in the afternoon. The other meal was called “high tea.” High tea was a larger meal eaten later in the night. It was popular among poorer people.\nVoice 1  \nIn Western Asia and the Middle East, a popular way to enjoy tea is as Masala Chai. Masala Chai is a drink made from black tea. But this drink has sugar, spices and milk in it.\nVoice 2  \nAround the world, people boil plants and flowers to make drinks similar to tea. These are called tisanes. A tisane is any drink made from hot water and any plant material, except from the tea plant. They are also often called herbal teas.\nVoice 1  \nIn areas of South America people enjoy a particular tisane. The drink is called Mate. People make it from the leaves of the yerba mate plant. A person puts dry yerba mate leaves into a dry gourd. This is a container made from a dried vegetable skin. He then adds water to the gourd. He drinks the liquid through a thin metal tube – a bombilla.\nVoice 2  \nPeople in Southern Africa make a drink called rooibos. This hot drink is made similar to tea. But instead of tea leaves, it uses the leaves from the rooibos plant. The drink is a red color, and is often called red tea.\nVoice 1  \nHowever you drink tea, the next time you have a cup, think of all the people around the world who are joining you!

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIn 1819, a young German doctor discovered a drug. The doctor’s name was Friedlieb Ferdinand Lunge. A friend had given Lunge some coffee beans to study. They were small and dark brown. As he tested the beans he discovered a chemical inside them: caffeine. Today, caffeine is the most used drug in the world. Many people depend on caffeine to help them start the day. And more and more products contain caffeine. But there are negative results from using too much caffeine. How much is too much? Today’s Spotlight is on caffeine.\nImage by laurent Lempens from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nCaffeine is a drug that naturally exists in some foods. It is found in coffee beans, cocoa beans, guarana, yerba maté, tea and other plants. Through history, people from all over the world have grown and used plants for the effect of caffeine. But today, people commonly get caffeine through coffee, tea, or soft drinks like Coca-Cola.\nVoice 1 \nIn a plant, caffeine is a natural pesticide – it makes insects unable to move and then kills them. But in a person’s body caffeine acts very differently. It speeds up a person’s central nervous system, inside the body. It stimulates the brain – that is, it makes a brain act and react faster. Some people feel that they can be more creative when they drink caffeine. It makes people feel more awake. And it can also increase physical performance in sports.\nVoice 2 \nCaffeine affects a person quickly. Imagine a person who is drinking a cup of coffee. The drug begins to affect him about five minutes after he starts drinking it. In 30 minutes, the caffeine affects the person most strongly. After about four and a half hours, his body has used about half the amount of caffeine. And by the next day, the caffeine is gone. Caffeine does not stay in the body.\nVoice 1 \nMany people begin their day with caffeine in coffee or tea. Spotlight writer Christy VanArragon drinks coffee every morning. But is it a good thing? She says:\nChristy VanArragon\n“Coffee makes me feel more awake and it helps me concentrate. But when I forget to drink it, I get painful headaches. And when I drink too much, my hands shake, and I talk really fast! Coffee is great most of the time, but it also causes some problems.”\nVoice 2 \nThese effects can be common for people who drink caffeine. In fact, people can come to depend on caffeine. People who try to stop drinking caffeine may be very tired, have muscle pains, or even have stomach pain. But these symptoms usually stop in about a week. Too much caffeine can also cause problems. People who have had too much caffeine may have head pain or stomach pain. They may have a rapid heartbeat. They may feel anxious, worried or nervous. Too much caffeine can make a person unable to sleep. But there are also more serious effects when people take extremely high amounts. These effects include a feeling of not knowing where you are, body movements you cannot control, or even death.\nVoice 1\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, health experts have set a safe level of caffeine a person can take. They advise that people do not take more than 400 milligrams of caffeine in a day. That is equal to about four to five cups of coffee. Many experts believe this amount is safe for an adult. Murray Carpenter wrote a book about caffeine. He told news organisation NPR:\nVoice 4 \n“For people who are using caffeine moderately, it is probably perfectly healthy. And we know there are some signs that we may even get some good effects out of long-term coffee drinking.”\nImage by S. Hermann & F. Richter from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nResearchers cannot agree if caffeine is good for people or bad for them. Caffeine does have some bad effects. But, like Carpenter says, caffeine also has some good effects. Research shows that drinking coffee and tea with caffeine may reduce the risks of some kinds of cancer. It can reduce a person’s risk of getting type two diabetes. And even though it increases blood pressure and a person’s heart rate, it does not seem to cause problems with a person’s heart. But these good effects do not come from drinking caffeine in soft drinks – just drinks like coffee and tea.\nVoice 1 \nAll of this information may make a person wonder what to do! But it gets worse. That is because recently, companies have been adding caffeine to more and more drinks and food. People may not know how much caffeine they are taking.\nVoice 2 \nThe FDA is a government agency in the United States. It sets safety rules for food and drugs there. In 2013, the FDA began investigating caffeine. They were looking particularly at caffeine in energy drinks and food. Michael R. Taylor works at the FDA. He told about a new chewing gum containing caffeine. Each stick of gum contains caffeine. He explained how products like these can be harmful for young adults and children.\n“Stay Alert” gum that includes caffeine; “A fellow geek sent me some Stay Alert ca” (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) by slworking2\nVoice 5 \n“The gum is just one more sad example of the movement to add caffeine to food. Our concern is about caffeine appearing in many new products. This includes products that may look good to children and young adults… One package of this gum is like having four cups of coffee with you… The large number of these products in the marketplace worries us.”\nVoice 1 \nCompanies are putting caffeine in products that young adults and even children may want to try. Many government organizations and health experts are working to regulate caffeine. They want to make rules about what products can contain caffeine, and how much caffeine those products can use. However, it is not an easy job. Stephen Braun wrote a book about caffeine. He told the BBC:\nVoice 6 \n“One problem with trying to regulate the substance is that it affects everyone differently. People have different bodies and different ways of processing food. It is impossible to say what a “safe” limit is for everyone. Ultimately, you have to be your own scientist. There is no other good method than carefully experimenting on yourself.”\nVoice 2 \nIt is important for a person to know how much caffeine he is getting through drinks and food. But it is also important for him to know how caffeine affects his body. A person should know what his body can manage.\nVoice 1 \nWhat about you? Do you use caffeine? Do you think putting caffeine in other foods and drinks is a good idea? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nThe Fugu fish is extremely poisonous to humans. Some people say it is hundreds of times more deadly than the poison cyanide. And there is enough poison in one Fugu fish to kill 30 people. Would you want to eat this fish? It can be safe if it is prepared correctly. But if a person eats a piece of incorrectly prepared Fugu fish, he will die.\nVoice 2 \nPreparing Fugu is a difficult job. Before a person can prepare Fugu, she spends at least two years studying under a master chef. She must pass a special Fugu test. The test is very difficult. One third of people taking the test fail.\nVoice 1 \nFugu is unsafe to prepare and eat. It costs a lot of money. And it can have a weak taste. But Fugu is very popular. So why would so many people want to eat it?  Fugu is taboo.\nVoice 2 \nTaboos are very important in any culture. A taboo describes something that is set apart. It is usually something that a person should not do for a particular reason. A taboo food is a food that most people will not eat. But a food that is taboo in one culture may not be taboo in another culture. But what makes food taboo in one culture and acceptable in another? Today’s Spotlight is on foods that are taboo.\nA Fugu fish; By Chris 73 / Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9900\nVoice 1 \nPeople have strong opinions about what is good to eat and what is not. Fugu comes from Japan, but food taboos exist all around the world. For example, in many countries, people do not eat dogs. This is because people keep dogs as pets – as their animal friends. But in some countries, eating dog meat is not taboo. For example, in some parts of Asia, people eat dog meat. In these places, eating a dog would not be a taboo.\nVoice 2 \nSome food taboos come from religion. What we eat is sometimes connected to what we believe. People eat cows in many parts of the world. But to Hindus in India, cows are taboo. The people there choose not to eat these animals.\nVoice 1 \nSome taboos develop out of tradition. Food taboos can celebrate a common history and bring people together. Every February, the people of Iceland hold a celebration, called Thorrablot. This is a celebration of Iceland’s history and culture. And food is an important part of Thorrablot – especially taboo food. Usually, decaying food is an important taboo. Decayed food can have dangerous bacteria. But at Thorrablot, one of the important foods is called Hákarl. It is a decaying – or fermented – shark meat.\nVoice 2 \nSharks are large dangerous fish. Sharks are found in many places around the world. But in Iceland, the sharks contain many particular chemicals to protect them from the freezing water. These chemicals make the shark poisonous to people. So, to eat the shark meat, cooks must use an unusual method.\nVoice 1 \nTraditionally, a person removes the shark’s head and insides. They set the shark on sand. Then they cover it with more sand and heavy rocks. This will press the liquids out of the shark’s body. It stays like this for six to 12 weeks. After the shark is cured like this, it is cut into long thin pieces. The pieces hang to dry for a few months. They develop a hard brown outer layer. It also has a particular smell. The shark meat is now fully fermented. The outer layer is cut off and the shark is cut into smaller pieces.\nHákarl that is ready to eat; Audrey from Seattle, USA, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nPeople say that when you are going to eat Hákarl, you should not smell it first. That is because the finished Hákarl smells like liquid human waste. But people say it tastes like cheese. Icelandic people say that eating the shark is a way to remember their history and culture. Even today, you can find Hákarl almost anywhere in Iceland — even in grocery stores.\nVoice 1 \nAnother reason people eat taboo foods is because they believe the foods will give them health benefits. For example, in Asian countries, some people eat the male sex organ of a bull, a male cow. This food taboo has a special effect. People believe it will give them a strong desire for sex. This thinking is not always based on modern medicine. Instead, it is part of a long tradition that connects eating well to good health. After all, food was the first medicine.\nVoice 2 \nNot all food taboos have a tradition that goes back many hundred years. Until 1947, India was under British rule. During this time, children with one British parent and one Indian parent were rejected by both cultures. These rejected people formed a separate culture. It has its own rules about food. One special food is kutti pi.\nVoice 1 \nKutti pi is made from a taboo food – a fetus. A fetus is an unborn animal, taken from the body of its mother. Usually, people make kutti pi using a goat fetus. But people do not eat kutti pi often. It can only be made when a pregnant animal is killed. This food is so taboo that sometimes meat sellers will not admit to selling it. They will only deliver it in secret.\nImage by Luke Savadogo from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nFood is important to us. It is easy to react to taboo foods with emotion. New or strange foods may be the most difficult thing to accept about a new culture. When we hear what other people eat, it is easy to judge them. It is easy to believe that since they eat strange things, they must be strange people.\nVoice 1 \nBut, we can remember that what people do is more important than what they eat. How people love is more important than what they cook. And the food they put in their mouth is not as important as the words that come out.\nVoice 2  \nWould you eat kutti pi?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nImagine it is a hot summer day. The sun burns down on your skin. You have been working hard. You just want a break. You want something cool to eat. What do you choose?\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nWell, millions of people around the world choose ice cream! Today’s Spotlight is on the history of this special icy treat.\nVoice 1 \nIce cream is generally a sweetened frozen food. It is usually made from cream, sugar, eggs, and different flavors. However, there are many different ways to make ice cream. No one knows exactly who invented ice cream. But there are many stories about how it began.\nVoice 2 \nA version of ice cream may have begun in Persia more than 2,500 years ago. And some stories say that Nero enjoyed ice cream in ancient Rome. They say Emperor Nero would send servants to get ice from the mountains. Then he would cover it in fruit juices and honey.\nVoice 1 \nThe kind of ice cream we eat today may have been invented in China. The Tang period in China was between 600 and 900 AD. During this period, people brought ice cream treats to the ruler. They heated buffalo, cow and goat milk together. After a time, the mix became thick like yogurt. They added flour to the mix. And they put camphor in it for flavor. They cooled the mix in icy water. Then they served it to the Emperor.\nVoice 2 \nMarco Polo was an Italian explorer. He traveled to many parts of the world as a merchant. When he visited China, he tried many of these ice treats. He even learned how to make some of them. Then, when he returned, he made these iced treats for his family and friends.\nMosaic representing Marco Polo at Villa Hanbury, Ventimiglia, Italy; Lotho2, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nAround this time there were also simple treats that were more like sorbet. Sorbet is an icy treat made with ice, sugar and fruit or fruit juice.\nVoice 2 \nAll of these ice cream treats became very popular in France in the 1500s. And it was not too long before they became popular all around the world. Over time, ice cream changed and developed in different ways.\nVoice 1 \nAs you have heard, ice cream was first enjoyed only by the rich. This was because keeping food at such a cold temperature or getting ice from a mountain top cost a lot of money. But, over time, the methods for freezing improved. And more and more people had the money and resources to buy ice cream and keep it cold.\nVoice 2 \nToday, People all over the world enjoy ice cream. Some studies say that New Zealand eats the most ice cream in the world per person. But other countries eat almost as much, including Australia, Finland, the United States, China and India.\nVoice 1 \nIce cream is a big business in many parts of the world. In 2016, researchers estimated that this industry was worth over 68 million dollars US. And it is only getting bigger. Growing markets like Brazil, China, and India are buying more ice cream. Experts estimate that by 2023, the ice cream industry will be worth over 97 million dollars US.\nIce cream in IKEA Hangzhou Qiaosi; Y Chen, CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nSome studies even suggest that the 2020 pandemic increased ice cream sales even more! They suggest that people were looking for delicious food that made them feel happy. That is ice cream!\nVoice 1 \nSo what kinds of ice cream are these people eating? Let’s take a look at some of the different kinds of ice cream around the world.\nVoice 2 \nItaly serves an ice cream called gelato. Italians make gelato with milk, water and different flavors. But gelato is a little different from ice cream. There is not as much air in gelato. Gelato is much thicker than normal ice cream. A person can eat smaller amounts because it is so filling and sweet.\nVoice 1 \nIn India, a popular treat similar to ice cream is called kulfi. Kulfi has more ice in it than other ice creams. It is not as smooth. Indians flavor kulfi with foods like pistachio nuts or cardamom spice.\nVoice 2 \nIn Japan, people eat mochi ice cream. First, people shape the ice cream into small, round balls. Then they cover these balls with mochi. Mochi is a kind of sticky rice.\nVoice 1 \nSome places even have a special ice cream they are famous for. In Ecuador there is a town called Salcedo. In Salcedo they serve ice cream on a stick. They freeze the ice cream in different layers, or parts. Each layer is a different color. So, the ice cream almost looks like a rainbow. There are four layers. Three are made from local fruits. And there is a top layer made of thick, sweet cream. When you drive into Salcedo you can even see a large statue of this ice cream treat!\nTypical Salcedo ice cream; Bbb-Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nIce cream is also a great treat because you can make it yourself! You can make your own ice cream at home with only a few simple ingredients. This ice cream looks a little different from the ice cream you buy in a store. It is softer, but it still tastes good. Here is how you make it. You can also find this recipe on our website.\nVoice 1 \nTo make this ice cream you need two zippered plastic bags – one large and one small. Fill the large bag halfway with ice and rock salt. Leave enough room in the large bag to fit the smaller bag inside. Then, in the small bag, combine milk or cream and a small amount of sugar. You can also add another flavor, like vanilla or honey. Take all of the air out of the small bag. And make sure you close the bag very tightly! Then put it inside the large bag of ice and salt. Here comes the fun part. Close the large bag, too. Then, shake shake shake! You must shake the two bags together for five to ten minutes. After it becomes harder, remove the bag of milk and sugar. It should now be ice cream. Now enjoy!\nVoice 2 \nWhat kind of ice cream is common in your country? What is your favorite kind of ice cream? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nWhile in Mexico City, Mexico, you might stop and buy a sweet, fried, churro. On Cheju Island in Korea, you might order some freshly caught fish, called hwae. In Bangkok, Thailand, you might need a drink. So you might buy a coconut fruit. You can use a thin straw to drink the liquid from inside it. In Chicago, in the United States, you might want to have a steamed hot dog.\nVoice 2 \nWarning! This program may make you hungry! Today’s Spotlight is on street food. Today we travel around the world. We look at the different kinds of foods people can eat on the street.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nPeople everywhere in the world love eating street food. But what is it? Street food can be food or drink. It can be fruits or vegetables. Or it could be something cooked like rice or meat, and more! It can be a person’s whole meal, or just a small snack. A vendor sells the food from a cart that can move, or from a stall – a small sheltered area. Vendors usually only sell one kind of food. And prices of street food are usually low.\nImage by Michelle Raponi from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThere are a few reasons why street food is so great. First, street food is easy to get. People who are hurrying somewhere can buy street food quickly. Vendors often have the food fully prepared.\nVoice 1 \nSecond, street food does not cost a lot of money. Very poor people can still buy street food. And a street food meal can include many healthy substances.\nVoice 2 \nFinally, there is one more reason street food is so great – and you may already know it. Street food is delicious! It tastes very good! And many of our listeners would agree! We asked Spotlight listeners to share some of their favorite street foods. People from all over the world answered.\nVoice 1 \nErioni from Albania wrote that she liked pies, burgers and hotdogs. Hot dogs were also Joel’s favorite food in the United States. In Uganda, Muhwezi and Bamutengire liked fruits and apples. And Sky and Tinah both liked Rolex. This is a thin bread surrounding egg and vegetables. Trinh from Vietnam simply answered “rice”. In Indonesia, Agustinus likes to order sego kucing. This is made with rice with things on top – like dried fish. Then it is wrapped in banana fruit leaves. And Ying-ying from the Philippines could not name just one favorite street food! She named fish balls, quail eggs, squid balls and barbeque.\nVoice 2 \nTravel writers have also written lists of the best street food around the world. Travel with us as we taste the different street foods of the world!\nVoice 1 \nMexico City, Mexico. Churros are one favorite food here. These are tubes of fried bread dough. The vendor fries the dough, or uncooked bread. Then he shakes cinnamon spice and sugar over it. It is a sweet snack!  Another famous Mexican street food is Elote. This food uses corn on the cob. That is, the corn is freshly picked from the plant. Then, the vendor takes the rough covering off the corn. He pushes a wooden stick through the corn cob. He cooks the corn over a fire. Then, he covers the corn with a good tasting mayonnaise sauce. He puts spicy chilli flakes and cheese on the corn. Finally, he squeezes a sour lime fruit over it.\nElote; Ines Suarez R., CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nHo Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Here, the most famous street food sandwich is called Banh mi. This sandwich is on long bread with a thick crust. Inside is meat and pickled vegetables. JJ Goode writes for the travel website concierge.com. He describes biting into this delicious sandwich:\nVoice 3 \n“Your teeth crash through the bread and into still-warm pieces of grilled pork. Then you taste crunchy cucumber, sweet-tangy pieces of pickled carrot and daikon and cilantro. It has just a bit of Vietnamese mayo. You should add a small amount of hot sauce. This may be the best sandwich you have ever had.”\nVoice 1 \nBerlin, Germany. You may be surprised to learn that Berlin has a very big Turkish population. So the street food here has a Turkish influence. One of these foods is called currywurst. Currywurst is a long thin piece of meat. The vendor cuts the meat into smaller pieces. Then she puts a special curry sauce on top of it. The sauce is made of curry spice and tomato sauces. People eat currywurst from paper plates with very small forks.\nVoice 2 \nMarrakech, Morocco. Marrakech’s main square contains hundreds of different food stalls. But everyone here knows one street food: harira soup. This liquid soup is a traditional food. A vendor makes it from good-tasting liquid broth, beans, onions, turmeric spice, and the cilantro plant. People eat the soup with a small wood spoon.\nVoice 1 \nMumbai, India. Bhel puri is a low-fat and good-tasting food that contains many vegetables. It is made with a plate full of puffed rice. This is a bigger form of rice. It crunches in your mouth. A vendor adds many different things on top. He may add potato, red onion, and cilantro. Then he adds a spicy tamarind sauce on top. The sauce is also tangy – it makes a person’s mouth water. The sauce makes some of the rice more soft. Bhel puri is spicy, tangy, crunchy and soft – a wonderful and interesting food!\nBhel puri; Rakesh Krishna Kumar, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nThese are just a few kinds of street food. But there are many more kinds all around the world. It is easy to see why so many people around the world eat it!\nVoice 1 \nBut there are some concerns about street food. People can get sick from street food. Vendors may work in unclean conditions. This means that people who eat street food may suffer from sicknesses like diarrhea or vomiting. People can even die from these sicknesses. But governments and health organizations also work with street vendors to improve the quality of street food.\nVoice 2 \nIf you love street food, you do not have to be afraid of eating it. Streetfood.org just suggests making wise decisions when you want to eat. Look for a vendor in a clean area. Are his hands clean? Is he wearing clean clothes? Is there a place for the vendor to wash dishes, and a separate area to wash hands? Finally, look at the food. Does it look fully cooked? Does it smell good or bad? If it smells bad, it is probably not safe.\nEnjoying street food in Hanoi, Vietnam; Image by Thomas G. from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nTell us about street food where you live!

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\n\nVoice 1 \nIt has been a long day. You have worked very hard. Now, you are sitting down to your dinner. Tonight you will have chicken and rice. You eat the good tasting meal, and even eat a little more. You go to bed happy. But a few hours later, you do not feel so well. In fact, you run to the toilet quickly. You vomit – your food is coming back up your throat! Your stomach feels terrible and it is making loud sounds. But that is not all! You have a fever. And your head and whole body also hurt. What happened to you? Could it have been your good-tasting meal? Today’s Spotlight is on food safety.\nVoice 2 \nFood safety is a problem in all places around the world – in developing and developed countries. The WHO says that millions of people get sick every year from unsafe food. More than 2,000,000 of these people will even die from these sicknesses.\nImage by Michelle Maria from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nA few years ago the WHO released a set of educational materials about food safety. They were five simple rules for preparing food in a safe way. They call these rules the “Five Keys to Safer Food”. People usually use keys to open things that are locked, like doors. But these keys aim to open the way to safer food.\nVoice 2 \nPeople in different areas of the world prepare foods in different ways. People eat different kinds of foods. Some people do not have enough money to buy refrigerators, cleaning materials or good cooking equipment. Some may not be able to get clean water. But the WHO believes that these five keys can still help to inform all people about disease that can come from food or water. Most of us prepare food at some time, and all of us eat it!\nVoice 1 \nSo what are these five simple rules? Here are the WHO’s five keys to safer food.\nVoice 3 \nKey 1: Keep clean.\nVoice 2 \nThe first key tells about the importance of washing.  People should wash their hands often – before touching food, while they are preparing food, and any time after they go to the toilet. People should wash all surfaces and equipment used for preparing food. People should also protect cooking areas and food from insects and animals.\nVoice 1 \nKeeping everything clean helps people to avoid micro-organisms. Micro-organisms are very small living cells such as bacteria or viruses. They are so small that we cannot see them. But some of them can cause disease.  Many dangerous micro-organisms live in soil, unclean water, animals and people. They can also live where we make food, especially if the places are dirty. Micro-organisms can move from one surface to another surface very quickly and easily.  Even a small touch can pass dangerous micro-organisms onto our hands, clothes, cooking tools, and cutting surfaces.  But if we keep everything clean, the micro-organisms do not get a chance to spread.\nImage by Christoph Schütz from Pixabay\nVoice 3 \nKey 2: Separate raw and cooked.\nVoice 2 \nPeople should separate raw, or uncooked food from foods that are already cooked and foods that will not be cooked. People should store raw meat, chicken, and fish in containers, or in separate areas. Raw foods should not touch prepared foods. The WHO also says that people should use separate equipment and tools for touching and preparing raw foods. For example, if a person uses a knife to cut raw chicken, he should not use that same knife to cut a cooked piece of chicken. He should wash the knife, or use a different knife.\nVoice 1 \nRaw meat and the liquid inside it often hide dangerous micro-organisms.  So if raw meat touches other food the micro-organisms could spread.\nVoice 3 \nKey 3: Cook completely.\nVoice 2 \nPeople should cook eggs and meat, like birds, seafood, and animals, especially carefully.  These foods may carry more micro-organisms than other foods. When meat is fully cooked the liquid from it will be clear, and not pink or red. People should boil food with a lot of liquid, such as soup, for at least a minute. That way, the pieces of meat and vegetables in the soup will be cooked completely. It is also important that people re-heat cooked food completely.\nVoice 1 \nWhen food is completely cooked, the micro-organisms inside it die. Then the food is safe to eat. The WHO says that heating foods to 70 degrees Celsius makes sure they are safe. Thick pieces of meat like whole birds, must reach 70 degrees even in the middle. A thermometer can be very helpful to make sure that the food reaches the correct cooking temperature.\nVoice 3 \nKey 4: Keep food at safe temperatures.\nVoice 2 \nPeople should eat cooked food immediately, while it is still hot. It should be above 60 degrees Celsius if possible. And food should not stay out for longer than two hours. When people are finished eating, they should keep the food that is left cold. The food should be stored in a refrigerator, or electric cooling device, below five degrees Celsius. And people must not store food for too long in the refrigerator.\nVoice 1 \nAt room temperature, about 20 degrees, the amount of micro-organisms can increase very quickly.  But temperatures above 60 degrees or below five degrees control the growth of micro-organisms. They cannot grow as quickly in a very hot or very cold environment.\nVoice 3 \nKey five: Use safe water and safe raw materials.\nVoice 2 \nPeople should use safe water or treat the water to make it safe. People should choose fresh foods. They should wash any fruits or vegetables in clean water, especially if they do not plan to cook them. The WHO says that people should choose foods that have gone through special processes to make them safe.  For example, pasteurization is a process that destroys many harmful micro-organisms. Milk is often pasteurized to make it safe.\nVoice 1 \nMany dangerous micro-organisms and chemicals can live in places that people may not expect. Water and ice can look clean, but may still contain dangerous micro-organisms.  Damaged or old food may develop harmful chemicals called toxins as it gets older. In some cases, these toxins can cause death. This key also says that washing and taking the skin off vegetables can also reduce the risk of harm from micro-organisms.\nImage by Pexels from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThese are the WHO’s five keys to safer food. Today, these materials are translated into 68 languages. Programs that encourage health use the five keys in over 100 different countries. People can use these materials to train anyone who prepares food.\nVoice 1 \nThere is much more information about food safety on the WHO’s website. You can find a link to the WHO’s Five keys to safer food on the script page of this program. You can also see if the materials have been translated into your language!\nVoice 2 \nThe writer and producer of this program was Liz Waid.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nImagine two men. Ahmad lives in Saudi Arabia. Alexander lives in Russia. These men are similar in many ways. They each work for a computer company. They each have a wife and two children. They each play on a local football team each Saturday. But there is something different about these two men. On many days after work, Alexander meets friends to drink beer and tell stories. Ahmad does not do this. He has never had a drink of alcohol in his whole life.\nVoice 2  \nAhmad and Alexander are not real people. But they represent many real people around the world. They also represent two positions on drinking alcohol. The first position is that people can drink alcohol every day. The second position is that people should never drink alcohol. But why is there such a difference? Is one correct? Today’s Spotlight is on drinking alcohol around the world.\nVoice 1  \nIn 2014, the World Health Organization did a study on alcohol and public health. They found that people around the world over 15 years old drank 13 grams of alcohol every day. This is about one drink each day. However, that is an average. Over 60 percent of people in the world do not drink any alcohol. This means that people who do drink, really average two drinks each day.\nPhoto by Elevate\nVoice 2  \nThe countries with the highest levels of drinking are countries of Eastern Europe. These include Russia, but also Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Romania, and Ukraine. A country like Belarus has almost two times the global average. People in Belarus average four alcoholic drinks every day.\nVoice 1  \nBut drinking alcohol is nothing new. People have been drinking alcohol for thousands of years. Experts have found ancient evidence that people drank alcohol. Andrew Curry wrote about this evidence for National Geographic.\nVoice 3  \n“Experts have shown that alcohol is one of the most universally produced and enjoyed substances in history. People were drinking alcohol long before they invented writing. Recent chemical research showed that the Chinese were making a kind of wine from rice, honey, and fruit 9,000 years ago. In the Caucasus Mountains of modern-day Georgia and the Zagros Mountains of Iran, grapes were one of the earliest fruits farmers grew. Wine was made as early as 7,400 years ago.”\nVoice 2  \nBut still, half the world does not drink any alcohol at all. The countries that drink the lowest amount of alcohol are Pakistan, Kuwait, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia. Most of the people in these countries are Muslim — they follow the religion of Islam. Many people in these countries believe that they should not drink alcohol at all.\nVoice 1  \nIslam is not the only religion that speaks against drinking alcohol. Many religions warn against drinking alcohol or drinking too much of it. There are warnings against drinking too much alcohol in Judaism, Christianity, Buddism, and Hinduism.\nVoice 2  \nSo, half the world drinks alcohol every day. The other half of the world does not drink any. Why does alcohol divide people so much? Iain Gately is the author of the book Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol. He spoke the radio program, On The Media.\nVoice 4  \n“When I looked into the subject of alcohol, I was surprised most by the two different and opposite sides of alcohol. In fact, the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, had exactly those two sides to his character. He could be loving and he supported the theater and many of the arts. Yet, at the same time, he could suddenly be full of anger and violence.”\nVoice 1  \nThere are risks in drinking alcohol. One big risk is alcohol addiction – when a person must drink alcohol before anything else. Alcohol addiction can cause people to lose their job, friends, or even their lives. But even in situations that are not as bad, alcohol can have negative effects. When people drink alcohol they do not make the same decisions they would if they were not drinking. People who drink alcohol are more likely to do risky things. This could include driving a car, fighting, taking drugs, or having sex. These risks do not always just affect the person drinking – they can affect other people too. For example, when a person decides to drink alcohol and drive a car, he or she could kill another person.\nPhoto by Michael Discenza\nVoice 2  \nDrinking a lot of alcohol is also bad for your health. If a person stops drinking for as little as 30 days, positive changes can happen in their body. People will have less fat in their liver. Their skin will be clearer. They will sleep better, have better concentration, and lose weight. Dr. James Ferguson spoke to NPR about giving up alcohol.\nVoice 5  \n“People always forget the amount of calories in alcohol. If you take a month off from drinking and you usually drink 20 drinks in that time, you are going to lose weight and fat. It is a very big decrease in calories.”\nVoice 1  \nSo with all these negative risks, why would someone drink alcohol? Because there are also good things that come from drinking alcohol. Experts encourage people to drink in moderation. That is, they drink a moderate, or responsible amount. When people drink in moderation, it can bring people together. In 2012 Psychological Science published a study. They found that alcohol helped people in social situations feel connected to each other. It increased the amount of time people talked to each other. And it reduced the amount of negative emotions they expressed. Drinking alcohol with other people creates community in the same way that laughing, singing and dancing can.\nVoice 2  \nBut scientists have also found that some alcohol can have a good effect on health. For example, red wine contains substances called antioxidants. These substances can help prevent heart disease. Drinking red wine in moderation may be good for your heart.\nVoice 1  \nBut for many people, these benefits are not worth it. They prefer to drink none at all. What about you?

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nA small group of people sit in silence. Their eyes are fixed on the movement of one woman – Sachiko. Sachiko is a small Japanese woman. She wears traditional Japanese clothes – a beautiful kimono. She is busy preparing a green tea. She concentrates on each of her movements. Each movement flows into the next. What is she doing? She is leading, or hosting, a Japanese tea ceremony. Today’s Spotlight is on the Japanese tea ceremony.\nVoice 2  \nIn Japan, drinking tea is very popular. Originally, people drank tea as a form of medicine. Soon they drank it because they enjoyed it. At first, black tea was the most popular. But in the 12th century this changed. The people used a different kind of tea – green tea, or ‘matcha’.\nPhoto by Alice Pasqual\nVoice 1  \nBoth green and black teas come from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant. People put the plant leaves in the sun to dry them. Black tea is dried in the sun for a longer time. The leaves react with the oxygen in the air and turn black. But to make green tea, people gently steam the leaves before drying. This way the leaves keep their green colour.\nVoice 2  \nThe Japanese tea ceremony developed over many years. But during the 16th century the ceremony became an art form called wabi cha. One of the people who influenced this art was the great ‘tea master’ Sen no Rikyu. He believed in the importance of peace, respect, purity and calmness. He combined this simple, everyday part of life with his spiritual beliefs. These are now called, ‘Sado’ – the way of tea.\nVoice 1  \nSachiko is a young Japanese woman. She has studied the tea ceremony for many years. She describes what the tea ceremony means to her.\nVoice 3  \n‘For me, the tea ceremony is like learning about life, how I live, and how do I see myself in this life. And my tea master will teach me history of the tea ceremony and teach me about movements or flower arrangement or utensil or pottery or any sort of thing. The tea ceremony takes normally about three hours.’\nVoice 2  \nIt takes many years to perform the art of a tea ceremony perfectly. Like Sachiko, students do not just learn about tea. They must also learn other traditions – such as Japanese writing and flower organising. At official tea ceremonies, even the people who attend must know some things about ‘Sado’. They must know the right ways to move – such as how to drink the tea. They must know when to speak and what to say.\nPhoto by Roméo A.\nVoice 1  \nIn most tea ceremonies, a host will invite four people. They are guests of the ceremony. The host’s helper leads these people into a waiting room. The helper offers sayu to drink. This is hot water for tea-making. At the right time, the helper leads the people to the tea room, or chashitsu. This special room is only for tea ceremonies. Tea rooms are usually inside a teahouse. Teahouses are usually outside, in the garden.\nVoice 2  \nBefore the host receives her guests she fills the stone basin with water. She washes her hands and mouth. She walks to the middle gate. Here, she welcomes her guests with a bow. No one speaks. The host leads the guests through the gate. Then, they too wash at the stone basin. They are then ready to enter the teahouse.\nVoice 1  \nThey enter the teahouse through a sliding door. The door is just under a metre high. Everyone must bow to go through. This is an important act. It is a sign of equality. When people are through the door they become equal. They lose their social position.\nVoice 2  \nThe tea room is simple. It usually has a hanging piece of material. This has Japanese writing on it. It may include words that show the values of the tea ceremony – like peace, respect, purity and calmness. The room also usually contains flowers.\nVoice 1  \nThe guests bend down on their knees. And they wait for the host to serve them. They leave their worries behind them. They centre their minds only on the room. Hosts may serve the guests sweets called higashi.\nVoice 2  \nThe host then organises the tea instruments. She cleans them with water. She dries them with a fine cloth. Then, she places three scoops of tea for each guest into the tea bowl, or chawan. She puts the right amount of water into the chawan. And then she mixes it using a chasen. She needs skill to mix the powdered tea in the correct way – to make it become a thick liquid. Then she bows. She lifts the chawan with her right hand. And she places it on her left hand. She turns the chawan to the right three times, using her right hand.\nVoice 1  \nThe host then passes the chawan to one of the guests. He bows and accepts the bowl. After he drinks from it, he cleans the top. Then he passes it to the next guest with his right hand. The guest turns the chawan and drinks from it in the same way. Guests look at the bowl before they drink from it. They see its beauty. During the whole ceremony the host serves the guests.\nVoice 2  \nEach instrument and movement is important in the ceremony. Buddhist theology influences much of these movements, positions and instruments. However, you do not have to be a Buddhist to take part in a tea ceremony. Some people take part in the ceremony simply to enjoy the social gathering. Others take part to enjoy the peace and calmness of the ceremony.\nPhoto by Yu Kato\nVoice 1  \nThe way of the tea has four main teachings: Wa means harmony or peace. People must try and be at peace with everything in their life – people and nature.\nVoice 2  \nKei means respect. People must respect everything around them.\nVoice 1  \nSei means purity. People must try to act purely.\nVoice 2  \nJaku means peace of mind. It is these values that tea masters spend years trying to learn through sado – way of the tea.\nVoice 1  \nWould you like a Japanese tea ceremony? Are there any ceremonies for food in your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 3 \n“Peter Menzel and I invited ourselves to dinner with 30 families in 24 countries. We wanted to explore people’s oldest social activity: eating.”\nVoice 1 \nThese are the words of writer Faith D’Aluisio. Peter Menzel is her husband. He is also a photographer – he takes beautiful pictures. Together, they travel the world. Faith writes about the things and people they see. And Peter takes pictures.\nVoice 2 \nIn the mid 1990s, Faith and Peter began to notice how people’s diets across the world were changing. They decided to write a book about their observations. Today’s Spotlight is on this book called Hungry Planet: What the World Eats.\nVoice 1 \nFood is a very important part of family life. It is part of everyone’s history and culture. Faith D’Aluisio and Peter Menzel wanted to show how diet affects health and culture. And they wanted to present this information in a beautiful way. In their book, Faith explains:\nVoice 3 \n“To learn more about how diets are changing, we watched normal families all over the world. We watched as they farmed, shopped at the market, cooked, and ate. At the end of each visit, we created a picture of the family. In the picture, the family is surrounded by all the food they normally eat in one week.”\nPhoto by Louis Hansel\nVoice 2 \nEach chapter in the book Hungry Planet: What the World Eats, starts with this large picture of a family. All the food they eat in a week is spread around them. Under the picture are the names of the family members. There are also the names of the city and country where they live.\nVoice 1 \nThe information also includes how the family prepares their food. Some families use a stove or a small electric microwave to cook their food. Other families cook around a fire on the ground. The book also explains how each family keeps their food fresh. Many families use an electric refrigerator to keep food cold. But other families must eat everything they prepare immediately. They have no way to keep their food fresh.\nVoice 2 \nFor each picture, D’Aluisio and Menzel organized the families’ weekly food into groups – like meat, fruits and vegetables, milk products, grains and bread, and drinks. They added up the money spent on each food group. Then they found the total amount of money each family spends on food in one week. Nick Page and Marina Santee share some examples from the book:\nVoice 4 \nThe Madsen family lives in Cap Hope village in Greenland. Five people live in the home. They spend $277 each week on food. They also hunt animals to eat fresh meat. These are animals that live in ice cold water such as polar bears, walrus, and arctic geese. Many people in Greenland hunt these large animals for their meat.\nVoice 5 \nThe Mendoza family live in Todos Santos Cuchumatan, Guatemala. Eight people live in the home. They spend $25 a week on food. The Mendoza family only eat meat less than once a week. They spend most of their money on fruits and vegetables like bananas, zapote, passion fruit, avocados, green beans, and red chili peppers.\nVoice 4 \nThe Al Haggan family lives in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Eight people live in the Al Haggan home. They spend $221 on food each week. Much of the food they eat is imported from other countries. They buy it at a western style market.\nVoice 5 \nThe Revis family live in North Carolina, in the United States. There are four people in the family. They spend $342 each week on food. They spend a lot of their money on fast food from eating places like McDonalds, Taco Bell and pizza places.\nVoice 4 \nThe Aboubakar family is from Darfur, Sudan. But they live as refugees in the country of Chad. D’jimia is a single mother. She has five children. The family spends a little over one dollar on food each week. Food does not cost as much here as in some other places. In other countries, where food costs more, this amount would be equal to about $24. Most of their meals are a thick liquid porridge made from the grain sorghum. D’jimia also receives food aid in her refugee camp. Some days the family lacks food. They must make difficult decisions. They must decide who gets more food, and who gets less.\nVoice 1 \nThese are just a few of the examples of the families in the book Hungry Planet: What the World Eats. All of the pictures in the book show the different food cultures of people around the world. Some people grow most of their food on their own land. Other people buy almost everything at a market. Others do not even cook much of their food. They buy food that is already prepared.\nVoice 2 \nPeople reading the book can also see how money influences food. Some families have enough money to eat any kind of food they want. They can buy food imported from other countries at the market. But many people must eat only what grows in their own area, depending on the season.  Some families eat a large amount of food. And other families must divide a limited amount of food.\nPhoto by Brooke Lark\nVoice 1 \nThe book Hungry Planet: What the World Eats is not about food politics. The book’s authors, D’Aluisio and Menzel, are not exploring why hunger exists in the world. They are only sharing what they experienced. The purpose of the book is to help people understand how other people live.\nVoice 2 \nThe book also encourages people to look at their own family and how they eat. Remember the Revis family from the United States? After seeing their picture in the book, the Revis family felt shame about the food they were eating. Mrs. Revis told D’Aluisio and Menzel:\nVoice 6\n“Everyone in our family felt very troubled by the large amount and kinds of food on the table for the picture. Before my son eats something now, he will say to me, ‘Mom, how healthy do you think this food is?’ That never happened before”.\nVoice 1 \nPeople have different customs but we share many similarities. D’Aluisio and Menzel found that around the world people love food. And people in every culture love to welcome new friends to eat with their family. What are the cultural food customs in your family?  What foods are common in your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nSergei Boutenko was 13 years old. His family decided to go on a long hike. They planned to walk for many days through forests and mountains. They would carry everything they needed. They planned everything well. But a few days into their hike, the family had no more food. However, they did have a book that identified which plants they could eat. They survived by eating plants they found. Boutenko explains in his book about finding food,\nVoice 3  \n“Wild food grew everywhere along the trail, so it soon became the main thing we ate. By the end, most of our diet was wild plants. All of the new plants we used in our meals were fresh and very good for our bodies. We were amazed how much we enjoyed the flavor of our food and always looked forward to the next meal. In short, discovering wild food let us successfully finish our hike.”\nVoice 2  \nThis event started Boutenko’s love for finding food in nature. There are many people just like him in many parts of the world. They love to forage or search, for food. Foraging can save money, improve health, and change how people see the world. Today’s Spotlight is on foraging for food.\nPhoto: Dana Critchlow\nVoice 1  \nFor most of human history, people did not get their food from a store. There were no large factory farms that put food in boxes and cans. People ate the food they grew on their own land. They hunted wild animals. And many people want to return to this way of living.\nVoice 2  \nForaging has become popular in recent years. People like Boutenko understand that there is food all around us. People have just forgotten how to see it. Brigit Anna McNeill teaches people how to forage. She also writes on her blog about foraging and how it connects people to the earth.\nVoice 4  \n“There is a lack of connection in our modern lives. It cannot be replaced with the latest iPhone, dress, bag, shoes or party. Many people live and work surrounded by concrete and steel. They eat processed foods. This limits contact with nature. Eating and gathering wild food brings me to nature. I know when I am eating more wild food, I feel more alive. I think of food as the greatest medicine and wild food is full of so much goodness that it heals me from the inside.”\nVoice 1  \nPeople who forage for food say there are many benefits to foraging. The first is that it can be very fun to do. Walking through nature is good for everyone. Children especially love to find plants they can eat. It can feel like hunting for treasure. It is a wonderful way for families to spend time together.\nVoice 2  \nForaging can also save money. No matter where you live in the world, people spend a lot of money of food. Foraging can reduce the amount of money spent of food.\nPhoto: Nico Benedickt\nVoice 1  \nAnd eating wild food both tastes good and is good for you. It is healthy food. There are berries, fruits, mushrooms, seeds, ocean mussels, flowers, and spices and herbs that grow wild. And wild food grows everywhere. You can forage no matter where you live.\nVoice 2  \nForaging can also change the way you see the world. When you can walk through a park or a forest and see food all around you, it changes you. People who forage are able to see that the world is not a frightening place. It is full of life. Everything we need to live has been provided for us.\nVoice 1  \nIf you want to start foraging there are a few steps you should follow before you start eating what you find. First, find an experienced forager. Not all plants are edible. Some can make you very sick. An experienced forager will help you know which plants are safe to eat.  Many places around the world have foraging groups or clubs. People in these clubs forage together. They share knowledge and information about what plants are good to eat and what plants to avoid.\nVoice 2  \nSecond, get a good guide book. A good guide book will identify all the edible plants where you live. It will have pictures of the plants. It will also tell you what parts of the plant you can eat. Plants have leaves, roots, stems, flowers and fruit. Just because you can eat one part does not mean you can eat all parts.\nVoice 1  \nThird, learn the common poisonous plants in your area before you begin to forage. This will help you feel more comfortable foraging. And before you eat any plant you find, you should know it is completely safe to eat. Never guess if a plant is safe or not.\nVoice 2  \nFourth, use all of your senses to identify plants you find. Plants smell, feel, and look different from each other. Use all of these senses to identify a plant.\nVoice 1  \nFinally, foragers must remember a few simple rules for foraging. Robin Shreeves wrote about foraging in Finland for the website Mother Nature Network. She suggested a few general rules to follow when you forage.\nVoice 5  \n“For your own safety, know how to correctly identify edible plants. Many plants can be poisonous. If you are in an area that has been sprayed with chemicals, like a public park, the edge of a farm, or someone’s back yard – those wild plants could be covered with chemicals. Also, take only what you will use. Leave at least half, even if you could use more. Do not step on other plants to get to your desired food. And make sure you have permission to forage on the land. If you are on private property or publicly owned property such as a park or nature area, foraging may not be permitted. Finally, if a plant has damaged leaves, mold, dark spots or other signs of being unhealthy, do not eat from it.”\nVoice 2  \nForaging can be fun, save money, and make you healthy. But some people do not like the idea of finding their own food. Do you think you would like to try foraging for food? Do you already forage for food? Tell us about your experiences.

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\nFighting hate begins with me. I can change my attitudes. I have courage. I know what is right. I can fight hate. It begins with me. With me.\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the last in a series of 10 programs. In this series of programs, we have looked at 10 ways to fight hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center in the United States has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the 10th way to fight hate in your community: Dig Deeper.\nVoice 1\nHave you ever examined your own opinions and beliefs? No one wants to have hateful feelings toward other people. No one wants to judge people who are different. No one wants to have bad thoughts about particular races, religions, or nationalities. But we all do. We may not even know the feelings are there. But no one is perfect. We all have prejudices. These opinions and beliefs influence our actions and thoughts.\nVoice 2\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, or the SPLC, wants all people to dig deep inside their hearts. They want people to find the harmful feelings inside themselves and then change them. The SPLC believes that each person must decide for himself if he will be tolerant or not. Tolerance means that every voice matters. It means that all people are valuable no matter who they are or what they believe. Every person can learn, accept, and practice tolerance.\nVoice 1\nThe SPLC lists “Dig Deeper” as the 10th way to fight hate. But they really believe that it is the first step a person must take to be more tolerant of other people.\nVoice 2\nSo, what are some ways for people to dig deeper and change their harmful thoughts? The SPLC says that a good way to discover harmful feelings is to ask questions … of yourself! They want people to look hard at their lives and their experiences to answer these questions. Here are some examples of questions we all should ask ourselves about what we think and feel.\nVoice 1\nDo I spend time with people of other races and religions? Do I have friends who are different from me?\nVoice 2\nDo I live near people who are different than me? Do I work with people who are different? Do my children go to school with people who are different?\nVoice 1\nDo my friends and family tell hate-based jokes or laugh at people who are different from them? How do I react to their jokes? Do I have the courage to tell them to stop?\nVoice 2\nWhere do I get information about other cultures? Do I read about other cultures from books or magazines? Do I get information from real people of that culture? Or do I depend on films and television programs by others to tell me about other cultures?\nVoice 1\nDo I take time to learn from other people’s experiences? Do I listen to people who have different opinions from me? Am I willing to hear all people’s stories and opinions?\nVoice 2\nHow often do I feel like a minority in a group of people? Do I know how it feels to live in a place where no one is like me?\nVoice 1\nThese are sometimes difficult questions. But these kinds of questions help people dig deeper into their own thoughts and feelings. People may discover harmful feelings that they did not know about. And they can work to change them.\nVoice 2\nOne person who decided to dig deeper was Derek Black. Black grew up in Alabama, in the southern United States. His father had been a leader in the KKK. This hate group believed that white people are better than any other groups of people. The KKK often used violence to spread their message. They targeted black people, immigrants, people of different faiths, and others.\nVoice 1\nBlack’s parents and community taught him that the United States was only for white people. They taught him to suspect the worst of other races. They taught him not to believe the government or news sources. His parents even took him out of school. At home, they could teach him their beliefs. Derek Black believed in the message of the KKK. He even spread that message on his own radio program.\nVoice 2\nAs a young man, Black went to college. There, he hoped to learn how to enter politics. He believed this was the best way to bring the KKK’s beliefs to more people. But that is not what happened.\nVoice 1\nFor a few years, Black spread the message of the KKK. He continued his radio program. But the students at Black’s college discovered Black’s beliefs. They wanted to change his mind. One night, another student, Matthew, invited Black to his house for a dinner with other students. Matthew was a Jew. Black had said terrible things about Jews before. But Black decided to go. \nVoice 2\nAt the dinner, Matthew asked the other students not to talk about Black’s beliefs. He wanted Black to get to know them. Over the next months, Matthew continued inviting Black to these group dinners. Black began to get to know the students from different places. He learned more about them as people.\nVoice 1\nHe got to know this group of people who were different from him. He had conversations with them. And after a time, Black’s ideas began to change. He did not change his views immediately. But after a few years, he knew that his beliefs were not good.\nVoice 2\nFinally, Black left the KKK. He no longer believes that any group of people is better than others. He sees the value in diversity – gathering people from all different places. Black regrets his past actions and words. He knows that his beliefs affected people. He told the Washington Post,\nVoice 3\n“It is not just that I was wrong. It is that I caused real damage.”\nVoice 1\nHe does have hope for people who are like he was. But it does take work. He told PBS News Hour,\nVoice 3\n“I think you can see hope in every individual person who comes to a new understanding about things or changes. And so that is always my advice to other people who wonder what we could do. My advice is to just start with one person that you have a connection with. And that is the most important and powerful thing you can possibly do.”\nVoice 2\nThere are many problems in communities all around the world. These are problems like sickness, poor quality housing, hunger, and violence. But these kinds of problems can be solved if people with different ideas work together. When a community decides to first deal with hate, many good things can follow. It is a long and difficult process to fight hateful thoughts and actions. But there is a very important question for each person: why not start today? The most important step is the first one.\nVoice 1\nWill you make that first step? What steps can you make to examine your own thoughts and feelings? What steps can you take toward fighting hate today?\nVoice 2\nThis is the last program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice. Here are their 10 ways to fight hate:\nAct, Join Forces, Support the Victims, Speak Up, Educate Yourself, Create an Alternative, Pressure Leaders, Stay Engaged, Teach Acceptance, Dig Deeper.\nVoice 1\nDid you miss a program from this series?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIn 2019, a group of researchers from York University in Toronto, Canada studied a group of school children. They showed each child the image of a face. Then they showed the child a neutral symbol. After they saw the symbol, researchers asked the children if the symbol was nice looking or not nice looking. The researchers were testing the feelings the children had about the faces. \nVoice 2\nThese researchers learned something alarming. Very young children already had opinions about people who were different from them. These opinions are called biases. Researchers learned that by the age of five, children already had biases about skin color. The children in this study gave more negative responses to images of boys with dark skin.\nVoice 1\nResearchers from Northwestern University in the United States did a similar study. They found that children as young as four have biases about people’s skin color. They have biases about gender, too. And they have biases about the way people talk!\nVoice 2\nThese studies show that every person can be affected by bias thoughts or feelings. Even very small children can have harmful opinions and biases. Young children can learn to judge people who are different to them. But where do these children get these ideas? And more importantly, how can we stop these harmful biases in children?\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the ninth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center in the United States has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the ninth way to fight hate in your community: Teach Acceptance.\nVoice 1\nAcceptance means accepting people for who they are. It means tolerating and respecting different opinions and beliefs. The Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, believes that children need to learn acceptance. And they need to learn it when they are very young. Otherwise, they may learn to hate. And studies like the ones at the beginning of this program show that children can learn to hate at a very young age.\nVoice 2\nThe SPLC says that one very important place to teach tolerance to children is school. School is a place where many different children come together in one place. In school, children talk, laugh and learn with other children.\nVoice 1\nThere are many ways to encourage children to celebrate differences in school. The SPLC even offers a Teaching Tolerance program. In this program, students take part in a special event every year. It is called Mix It Up at Lunch Day. At this lunch, each student sits next to someone they do not know. They have questions to help them have good conversation. They get the chance to learn things about someone new or different from them.\nVoice 2\nAnother way to teach acceptance is to have children tell stories about their families. By doing this, children learn about each other’s culture and traditions. They learn to value the different kinds of families that people come from.\nVoice 1\nTeachers can also teach tolerance by asking children to imagine what the world would be like if there was no hate. Martin Luther King Jr. was a famous black preacher in the United States. He fought for the rights of black people in the United States in the 1950s and 60s. At that time, black people were kept separate from white people. They did not have equal rights. \nVoice 2\nMartin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called “I Have a Dream.” In that speech he talked about his dream for the future. He dreamed that slaves and slave owners would sit together at a table as brothers. He dreamed that one day white children and black children would play together and hold hands peacefully. But most of all, he dreamed of a world where people would not be judged because of their skin color. Instead, they would be judged by their words and actions. \nVoice 1\nMany teachers ask their children to write their own “I Have a Dream” speech. They ask children to imagine a better and more accepting world. Then children write about their hopes for the future.\nVoice 2\nOlder children and young adults can learn more about tolerance by studying popular media sources like films and television. They can look at how the media presents different races, religions and ethnic groups. They can decide if they agree with the films and television programs. Some films and television programs use stereotypes. That is, they present groups of people as being all the same. People can see the dangers of presenting a group of people using stereotypes.\nVoice 1\nThese are just a few ways that the SPLC talks about teaching tolerance to children in school. But school is not the only place for children to learn tolerance. The most important place for a child to learn tolerance and acceptance is from adults, like parents and members of their community.\nVoice 2\nEvery adult is a teacher to children. Children copy the actions and words of adults in the community. You can teach a child tolerance by being a good example for her to follow. Show tolerance for the people you work with or meet in your community. If you are a tolerant adult, your children will be more tolerant too!\nVoice 1\nAcceptance is important for people of all ages to learn. You can examine your own thoughts and opinions. Are you tolerant of people who are different to you? Are there people in your community that you avoid, ignore, or try to forget? These things can be just as harmful as treating someone badly. We can all work to be more tolerant people. And that helps us teach tolerance to everyone we know. You can encourage other adults to be tolerant too. Parents can teach tolerance to their children. Teaching tolerance today can help stop hate tomorrow.\nVoice 2\nThis is the ninth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice.

How do you bring people together to make a positive change? Wagner is a city in South Dakota, in the United States. There are two main people groups in Wagner. There are many white people and there are Native Americans living nearby.\nVoice 2\nAnd like in many other places, these differences have led to racial tensions. Not all people are treated equally. This influences many parts of life. It makes progress in the town slow. The community wanted to improve these tensions. People from different backgrounds and different races joined together to achieve this goal.\nVoice 1\nIn 2008, they started with something simple, even though it was also very difficult: they talked to each other. The community in Wagner started study circles. These were small groups of people who met together. They discussed important issues in the community. People did not always agree. But they always respected each other.\nVoice 2\nThe community of Wagner saw the benefits of these study circles. They wanted these groups to continue. In the groups, they talked about hard issues. They talked about poverty. They addressed how people in the community had hurt people different than them. They wanted to fix this hatred. They wanted to bring more diversity to their city. They wanted to make life better for everyone in their community. They knew it would take time, and lots of work. They stayed engaged.\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the eighth in a series of 10 programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at 10 ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2\nHate is powerful enough to damage people and communities. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the eighth way to fight hate in your community: Stay Engaged.\nVoice 1\nSometimes, there is one act of hate that you can fight against. There is one rally or one hateful person. But usually, hate runs deeper. You may have to work for a long time to get rid of it. This Spotlight program is about how to fight hate when the problem is too big or too deep to go away quickly. Big problems like discrimination and racial hatred may take a long time to heal. People must work hard to get rid of hate in their communities. That hard work may take a long time. People must look toward the future.\nVoice 2\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, says that planning for your community’s future is important. Every community has problems. But when people do not look at or deal with the problems, the problems seem bigger. They become more difficult to solve. And the future of the community looks frightening. This is especially true with the problem of hate in a community. So, the SPLC encourages communities to stay engaged. That is, it is important that communities do not give up in the fight against hate. They must plan for the community’s future.\nVoice 1\nThe problem of hate does not usually come from outside a community. Instead, hate begins inside a community. Groups of people may blame each other for problems in the community. Or people may feel as if they have no voice in their community. They feel unsupported and powerless. Differences and change can cause fear. And fear can lead to hate.\nVoice 2\nCommunities can deal with fear and hate. The SPLC says that a tolerant and united community can stand against hate. Imagine a community that accepts people no matter who they are or what they believe. That community does not accept hate. Hate cannot exist if people do not let it. Stopping hate in your community will improve your community’s future.\nVoice 1\nBut where can you start? The SPLC says that the first step to changing your community is to change yourself! You can change the way you speak about people who are different than you. You can also change the way you think about people who are different than you. Do you have an opinion about a particular group of people? These opinions are biases. They can negatively influence your actions in your community.\nVoice 2\nChanges in individuals are very important. But changes in the whole community are important too. And there are many things people can do to encourage communication and tolerance in a community.\nVoice 1\nThere are many examples of groups who worked together and stayed engaged to fight hate in their communities. Here is one example you can use in your community!\nVoice 2\nEveryday Democracy is a group that helps communities discuss issues with each other. One way they do this is with study circles. These study groups are one way to start community discussions. We talked about how this worked in Wagner, South Dakota, at the beginning of the program. Study groups are safe places for different people to talk with each other about their opinions and beliefs. People from different groups can come together and get to know each other.\nVoice 1\nYou can start a study circle in your community. In fact, you can start any group to talk openly about the issues in your community. These groups should accept every person. They should respect every person’s opinion. And when people in a study circle talk, they do not always have to agree on everything. That is even part of the fun!\nVoice 2\nPeople who join study circles gain understanding of different people. They gain hope for a better future. They know that they can help to solve problems and conflicts in their community.\nVoice 1\nPeople in a community should be able to live together in peace. How will you help plan and influence the future of where you live? Hate will not disappear overnight. Stay engaged in the long-term fight against hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nThis is the eighth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate.

Their school had been named after Robert E. Lee. He was a general in the Confederate Army. This army was one side of the US Civil War in the 1860s. They fought for the right to own slaves. Robert E. Lee also owned slaves.\nVoice 2\nThe group of students did not want to honor this man or his history. So they started a campaign to change the name of their school. They inspired posts and hashtags on social media. The students asked their leaders to take action.\nRobert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, United States.; Larry D. Moore, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1\nSomething similar happened in the state of Alabama. Three schools there were named after Confederate leaders. Groups of students and supporters asked their school boards to change the name of the schools. They told their leaders that it was time to face history. It was time to take action to help fix a problem of hate in their community.\nVoice 2\nToday’s Spotlight program is the seventh in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 1\nHate is powerful enough to damage people and communities. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the seventh way to fight hate: Pressure Leaders.\nVoice 2\nGood and effective leaders can do much to fight hate in a community. In fact, the SPLC says that “the fight against hate needs community leaders willing to take an active role.” Community leaders must ACT. They must use their authority to fight against hate. They must be good examples for people to follow.\nVoice 1\nSometimes it is difficult for leaders to act against hate. A leader may fear losing supporters or his job. Or a leader may not have a close relationship with the people she leads. That is why the SPLC encourages people to pressure leaders. People can come together. They can influence and educate their leaders. Leaders can then lead a community to helpful change. So, how can you encourage your leaders to lead a fight against hate? How can you influence them toward change? How can you pressure your leaders?\nVoice 2\nFirst, the SPLC says to form relationships with your community leaders. Leaders and communities who are close can communicate their needs better.\nVoice 1\nSecond, you can educate your community leaders about hate. Help them understand the causes and effects of hate. Leaders may not understand that hate affects every member of a community. Hate is a serious community problem. When good leaders know the facts about hate, they want to stop it quickly.\nVoice 2\nThird, the SPLC says we need to demand that authorities react to a hate-based incident or a hate crime quickly and seriously. It is important that authorities completely investigate hate-based crimes. Local media like newspapers, radio, and television often report on crimes in an area. The media can show people the effects of hate. The media can encourage communities to accept other people no matter who they are or what they believe.\nVoice 1\nFourth, expect leaders to speak against hate-based incidents strongly and publicly when they do happen. Leaders represent large groups of people. When a leader speaks against hate, she influences her listeners. She also influences her listeners when she speaks for tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means to respect every person equally. If a leader does not speak against hate, she is still sending a message. She sends a message that the community accepts hate.\nVoice 2\nFifth, leaders must clearly name the problem. Sometimes it is difficult to speak clearly and openly about hate. Leaders may try to avoid using the word “hate.” Or they may try to forget about the problem. But forgetting about the problem of hate makes victims of hate crimes feel unsupported. A community without honesty becomes divided. It suffers. And it lets hate continue.\nVoice 1\nLastly pressure your leaders when they do not act. Leaders in a community must be involved in the fight against hate. Ask leaders to be involved by speaking at peace events. Ask them to attend community meetings. Ask them to help create long-term ways to solve the problem of hate. Leaders who fight against hate have stronger communities. Victims in their communities feel supported. Whole communities feel safer. And they know how to react to future hate-based incidents.\nVoice 2\nThese are all good ways to pressure your leaders to encourage tolerance. But what happens when a leader makes a racist comment? What happens when elected officials, police, or community leaders encourage hate instead of tolerance?\nVoice 1\nThe SPLC believes that community members have power to encourage, or pressure, leaders in that case too. The SPLC encourages community members to put pressure on hate-filled leaders. They say you can organize a group of people who believe in tolerance. Encourage your group to write letters to the leader. Encourage your group to organize public events. Leaders who encourage hate will damage their communities. Work to educate and communicate with these kinds of leaders in your community. Help them understand that leaders need to be involved in the fight against hate.\nVoice 2\nRemember the students in Texas and Alabama from the beginning of this program? The school board leaders in these places voted to change the names of their schools. Many other schools in the Southern United States are doing the same still today. Marché Johnson was one of the people in the movement in Alabama. She told the SPLC,\nVoice 3\n“We proved through this movement that things can change. Now is the time for conversations and action to happen. It is a healing process – and it starts with this.”\nVoice 1\nThis is the seventh program in a series of ten programs on ten ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

But sometimes that message is not a good one. Instead, it is a message of hate. Sometimes people will gather together against others they think are different. They form hate groups. These hate groups sometimes organize crowds of people. They send out information about their gathering, or rally. They meet at a particular time and place. They may bring signs to carry. These signs tell the message of the hate group. Often, these signs insult another particular group of people.\nVoice 2 \nSometimes these rallies become dangerous. People may come to protest the rally. People in the rally and people protesting the rally may begin to fight. Riots may start. Police may try to keep the peace. They arrest people who are fighting. Often, people fighting suffer injuries. News of the hate rally violence spreads. In the end, more people know about the hate rally.\nVoice 1 \nBut people do want to protest hate rallies. So, how can a person show that he disagrees with hate, or a hate rally? How can a person lead a protest to a hate rally without inciting violence?\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the sixth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate and hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nHate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the sixth way to fight hate: Create an Alternative.\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nPeople faced with hate rallies may feel helpless against such a large hate-filled group. They may feel anger. People may want to show their anger by physically hurting the hate group or causing trouble for them. People protesting hate may want to shout or throw something at the hate group.\nVoice 1 \nBut violent protests like this do not usually change anything. In fact, protesting a hate group like this can cause more trouble and hate in a community. And violent protests force police to protect everyone at a rally – even the hate group.\nVoice 2 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has a different idea about what people can do when they are faced with a hate rally. They say that “Every act of hatred should be met with an act of love and unity.” That is, people can create a sort of balance. When someone does an act of hate, another person can fight it with an act of love.\nVoice 1 \nYou can do this when you are faced with a hate rally. This is creating an alternative. An alternative is a different thing to choose. For example, one thing you could do is to attend a hate rally to protest it. Or you could choose an alternative. You could choose to protest the hate rally in a different way.\nVoice 2 \nSo, what could you do as an alternative? Well, the Southern Poverty Law Center suggests holding another event. This other event should be in a different place, but at the same time as the hate rally. You could host, or lead, a picnic, a parade, or a celebration of diversity. Celebrate every kind of culture represented in your community. Include as many different cultures in your celebration as you can. Celebrate the different religions in your community. Include food, music, dancing, and information about the many different kinds of people near you.\nPhoto by Kalle Lundin on Unsplash\nVoice 1 \nThis will offer other people an alternative too. They can attend your event instead of the hate rally. This will also take away attention from the hate group. And it will help people value each other and all our differences. One town in Maine, in the United States, experienced this kind of alternative. Here is the story.\nVoice 2 \nIn 2001, Many Somali immigrants came to the town of Lewiston, in the state of Maine. They wanted to improve their quality of life. They did not just want lower cost housing. They wanted good schools. They wanted a smaller community where they could work and raise their children.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2002, a local government official, the mayor of Lewiston, sent the Somali community a letter. He asked them to stop inviting more family to live in Lewiston. He told the group that the town of Lewiston could not deal with any more Somalis. He said that many new immigrants cost a lot of money. Somali community members were shocked at the mayor’s letter. Some of them insulted the mayor. Some Somalis wrote back that they were helping the community, not hurting it.\nVoice 2 \nA hate group also read the mayor’s letter. They saw a chance to spread their message. They planned a hate rally in January 2003. They hoped that people would join their rally against the Somalis.\nVoice 1 \nPeople in the community reacted to the plan for the hate rally. They planned an alternative event. The group planning the new event called themselves the “Many and One Coalition”. They invited local churches, students, and many concerned people to join the event. They used the event to teach people about diversity, or differences in people.\nVoice 2 \nThey hoped their event would send a message against hate. They believed that their message against hate would be stronger than the hate group’s message.\nVoice 1 \nThey were right! More than 4,000 people attended the Many and One Coalition’s diversity event. And fewer than 100 people attended the hate rally.\nPhoto by Nitish Meena on Unsplash\nVoice 2 \nLove is stronger than hate. When people act in love, they can make a community stronger. They can stop hate – together.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the sixth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In April 2017, a man invaded the home of Sarah Halimi. He called her hateful names and attacked her. He threw her from a window. She died after this attack. The man wanted to hurt Halimi because she was Jewish.\nVoice 2 \nIn January 2018, an eight-year-old boy was attacked while walking to tutoring. He was wearing a kind of Jewish hat.\nVoice 1 \nIn recent years, many Jews like Sarah Halimi and this eight-year-old boy in France have been hurt because of who they are. French government officials say that anti-Jewish beliefs are “spreading like poison” there. More and more Jewish people in France are reporting experiencing crime or hateful speech because of who they are.\nVoice 2 \nCrimes done against people because of who they are, are hate crimes. President Emmanuel Macron of France responded to these and other hate crimes. He said:\nVoice 3 \n“Every time a citizen is attacked because of their age, their appearance, or their religion, it is an attack on the whole country.”\nEmmanuel Macron, President of France; “Emmanuel Macron” (CC BY 2.0) by paquierjacques\nVoice 1 \nWhy do hate crimes like these happen? How can France, and other countries, deal with them? Today’s Spotlight program is the fifth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the fifth way to fight hate in your community: Educate Yourself.\nVoice 1 \nHow can a community understand people who do hate crimes? How can they react to such violence and hate? The SPLC says that researching the facts about hate groups and hate crimes can be one answer. They call this educating yourself. When people have the facts about a hate group, they can fight hate. Communities must know about hate groups and hate crime before they can react to them and stop them. But knowledge can also help people stop hating. Hate usually comes from fear. And understanding can defeat fear.\nPhoto by mentatdgt from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nA hate crime often starts with a bias. A bias is an opinion about someone who is different from you. A person often makes a bias because he does not understand people from another group. Often, we do not know people who belong to different religious or racial groups than ourselves. If we have never met someone from that group, we can easily form wrong opinions about them. These biases might be negative. Sometimes they encourage prejudices and hate.\nVoice 1 \nEvery person has biases. Often, people do not even know their own biases. But they express biases in many forms. A person can express his bias in words or actions. The SPLC calls some incidents “bias incidents.” For example, a racial joke is a bias incident. Bias incidents do not involve criminal acts like beatings, starting fires, or damaging property.\nVoice 2 \nHate groups try to use and encourage the biases people already feel. In fact, hate groups are usually very skilled at spreading their biases. They use propaganda. Propaganda is bias information that people use to spread a particular message. These hateful messages can appear as a painting on the side of a building, on a paper hanging in a local store, or even sometimes on television or the radio.\nVoice 1 \nHate propaganda influences how people think of each other. It tries to represent groups of people as less than human. Slowly, members of a community begin to think that a particular group of people is not important or is harmful. Angry, scared individuals may attack the minority group. These criminals believe that their actions are accepted. They may even believe that they are doing good work.\nVoice 2 \nThe SPLC says that most hate crimes are not committed by hate groups. They are committed by individuals, alone or in small groups. These individuals have listened to hate propaganda. They let their biases influence bad actions. These criminal actions are hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nAny criminal act done against someone because of a bias is a hate crime. Attacking someone because of their religion, race, sexual history, sex, or disability is wrong. It is a hate crime. Many areas punish hate crimes severely. But how do we stop hate crimes from happening?\nVoice 2 \nFirst, it is important to try and understand your own biases. What do you know about people who are different to you? The first step is to learn about people who are different to you. Try to understand them. Learn about them. When we understand and listen to each other, we learn to accept our differences. Continue investigating your own biases.\nVoice 1 \nSecond, if you observe or experience a hate crime, try to find out if a hate group was involved. You can also research facts about the particular hate group you are trying to stop. What does the group want? What signs or symbols represent the group?\nVoice 2 \nExperts say that members of hate groups often want to divide communities. They want to separate a community into racial, ethnic or religious groups. They may want to give particular groups in the community limited rights. Many do not respect or recognize the authority of the government. And they try to harm people who oppose them and their ideas.\nVoice 1 \nWhen you know about the hate groups in your area, you are more prepared to fight against the hate they represent. If you have children, talk to them about how they should react to hate. Share information you have learned with your community.\nImage by truthseeker08 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nInformation and education are powerful. When people have the facts, they can make better decisions. When people learn about other cultures, they do not feel threatened by them. Education helps people to understand the world and other people better.\nVoice 1 \nHate and hate crimes cannot continue. Whole communities must join the fight against hate. We can all encourage tolerance and acceptance in our communities.\nVoice 2 \nThis is the fifth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate.

This park is in California in the United States. Dupuy was enjoying the park with her friends. But a man walked over to her. He asked where she was from. Dupuy grew up in the United States. But her ancestors were from Korea. She told the man she was Korean. Then he began making bad comments to her. After a short time, he began attacking her. She told the Triton Times:\nVoice 3 \n“He made comments to me and many other people and no one stopped him. He threatened me with physical violence. No one stopped him. I protected myself and he still was able to attack me. People only helped me after I got hurt.”\nVoice 2 \nThe man broke Dupuy’s shoulder and gave her a concussion — a serious injury to her head. Leticia Clark is the Mayor of Tustin, where this incident happened. She said in a statement:\nVoice 4 \n“I want to send a clear message. Tustin has zero tolerance for bigotry or racism. I am very disturbed by the rise in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans. As a community, we cannot be silent about these crimes. If we witness acts of hate and discrimination, we must speak out, stand up and stop it.”\nRally to stop Asian hate, McPherson Square, D.C. 3/21/21; “Stop Asian Hate” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by vpickering\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the fourth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate. On today’s Spotlight we look at the fourth way to fight hate in your community: Speak Up.\nVoice 1 \nThe fast rise in anti-Asian hate began in 2020. In March of 2020, the President of the United States made a tweet. In that tweet, he called covid-19 “the China virus”. He continued to call this virus by this name instead of covid-19.\nVoice 2 \nHateful words from leaders have real consequences. Studies have shown that words like this caused the rise in anti-Asian hate and attacks on Asian people in the US. The group Stop AAPI Hate records hate incidents against Asian Americans. In 2020, there were more than 3,700 attacks on Asian people. But in March 2021, that number had increased to over 6,600.\nVoice 1 \nBut people like Jenna Dupuy are bravely speaking up. In May of 2021, Dupuy was a speaker at a Youth Against Hate rally. At this rally, youth from different groups gathered together to speak out against hate.\nVoice 2 \nSeveral youth organizations planned the rally. The SPLC believes that anyone can fight hate by speaking up like these students did. People can make posts on social media. They can make pamphlets or fliers. They can email local news stations. You can spread tolerance by speaking up. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means respecting every person equally.\nVoice 1 \nIt is easy to stay quiet in a difficult situation. No one wants to be a target of violence or hate. And it is difficult to speak up when it seems everyone else has a different opinion. But there are many different ways to speak up.\nA teacher and students; Photo by Katerina Holmes from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nThe website learningforjustice.org has produced a guide for teachers who want to stop hate. But these are good tips for any person. They say one way to speak up is to prepare yourself and practice. Remind yourself that you are a person who speaks up against hate. Believe it. This simple exercise can change your mind from doing nothing to taking action.\nVoice 1 \nThe next step is to memorize some simple phrases. These phrases will work for different situations. For example, when you hear a hateful joke, you can say something like “I do not find that funny”, or “that offends me”, or “I am surprised to hear you say that”. These phrases can help begin a conversation about stopping hate.\nVoice 2 \nYou can also interrupt hate by asking questions. Some simple questions are: “What do you mean by that?” “Why would you say something like that?” “What point are you trying to make by saying that?” Questions make the person who said the hateful thing have to think about their answer. They may not understand that the thing they said was racist. They may not even be able to explain why they said it. Speaking up can help people examine their part in stopping hate.\nVoice 1 \nYou can also speak up by learning. Information can encourage tolerance. You can research facts about the effects of hate on a community. We will talk about how to educate yourself in the next program.\nVoice 2 \nYou can spread this or any information about tolerance at your school, the place where you worship, or on a website. You can bring information to the people who live near you. Offer to talk with them about tolerance and hate.\nVoice 1 \nAnyone of any age can fight hate. 626 Speak Out is a youth organization. They want to encourage young people to become activists. They want young people to learn about and speak up against tough issues. Jayden Chow is in high school. He is an outreach leader for 626 Speak Out. He told his high school newspaper:\nVoice 5 \n“You have a voice for a reason. And if you have that voice, you should be able to use it for good. And especially in our modern day, you should use your voice to help others. It is especially important to educate yourself. That is not only for school, but socially as well. You need to be aware of what is happening to other people, not only those around you maybe, but everywhere in the world.”\nHands in a circle together; Photo by Mikael Blomkvist from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nSpeak up. Help your community to see hate for what it really is. (Speak up.) Encourage your local radio and television news stations to report hate incidents and peace rallies correctly and fairly. (Speak up.) Write to your local newspapers and magazines. Encourage them to look closely at efforts to fight hate. (Speak up.) You have the power to change your community. Speak up!\nVoice 1 \nThis is the fourth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn April 2019, Natasha Badhwar was preparing for a trip. She was going to visit a few small villages in northeastern India with a team of people called the Karwan-e-Mohabbat. In English this means “Caravan of Love”.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nKarwan-e-Mohabbat is a group that supports victims of hate crimes and other injustice. Since 2017, this group travels all around India. They meet with victims of hate crimes. They give legal and social help. On their website, Karwan-e-Mohabbat says that many places they go they meet minorities living in fear. These minorities often accept that hate and violence are a normal part of life for them. And many people in the majority community do not seem to care. What was Badhwar going to do there? Why would she travel with this group?\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the third in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center has made a list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the third way to fight hate in your community: Support the Victims.\nSikkim is a northeastern state of India, north of West Bengal, east of Nepal; Photo by Anja Disseldorp, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nNatasha Badhwar wrote about her experience on Mint, a news website in India. During her trip, Badhwar met a mother named Manju Devi. Her son had been killed. In her community, it was not permitted for people to fall in love with someone who was not Hindu. People had killed Devi’s son because they thought he was in love with a Muslim girl.\nVoice 2 \nAfter this attack, there was more violence. Four other Muslim men were killed. Shabnam Khatoon survived this violence. Khatoon said that he did not want revenge for his friends who had been killed. He told Badhwar:\nVoice 3 \n“We want justice. We want peace. Do we not deserve to rebuild our broken lives?”\nVoice 1 \nOne of the other members of Badhwar’s group was Mohammad Aamir Khan. He had spent 14 years in prison for a crime he had not done. He spent time locked away alone in solitary confinement. Guards beat him. He had lost his parents. He did not deserve what had happened to him. It was difficult. But he refused to be defeated.\nImage by Ichigo121212 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nKhan encouraged the victims of hate crimes they met on their trip. After he had been mistreated, he found hope. He had found a greater vision. He told these people not to see themselves as victims who are alone. Instead, he said they should give their support to others who were also hurting. He told them many others do not deserve their hurt.\nVoice 1 \nBadhwar was discouraged by the injustices that she saw on her trip. But she did not give up. She says:\nVoice 4 \n“The healthiest response to frightening or overwhelming information is action. We can step out to face violence and hate. When we do this, we also discover the power and grace of those who stand up to it. We find the strength we were afraid we did not have.”\nVoice 2 \nHate crimes happen in every country in the world. People attack other people because of the color of their skin, their religious beliefs, their sexual preferences, their abilities, or just because they are different. A person is attacked just because of who they are.\nVoice 1 \nThe victims of hate crimes might feel alone and afraid. Sometimes, the victim of a hate crime will refuse to report the hate crime. He may be afraid that he will suffer again. Or he is afraid that the authorities will not help him.\nVoice 2 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center believes that one way to fight hate is to support the victims of hate crimes and hate-based incidents. When a victim feels supported, he is more likely to report a hate-based incident or hate crime. And when victims report hate crimes, communities can do better at preventing future hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nVictims of hate crimes may feel as if they have no value in a community. So, the people of a community must show that they do value every member of the community.\nVoice 2 \nYou can do many things to support victims of hate crime. The SPLC says that even small and simple acts of kindness can make a victim feel as if he has value. A letter, a visit, or a telephone call can show your support and love for a victim of a hate crime. This is what Natasha Badhwar was trying to do. Listening to and being with people who are victims shows that they are valued.\nVoice 1 \nIf a hate crime has damaged a person’s property, you can offer to help fix the damage. You could ask other members of the community to help. Help to paint over harmful words. Help to clean up broken glass.\nImage by John Hain from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nWhen communities support victims, they help to stop hate. They send a message to hate criminals that they will not accept hate.\nVoice 1 \nIf you are a victim of hate, you should not suffer in silence. The SPLC urges you to report your incident to the police. Often, unpunished violence escalates. It grows and gets worse. If it is reported, this can stop the violence before it escalates. You can also report your incident to the local newspaper. If you see a hate crime, you can also report it. Victims should not be the only people speaking out against hate.\nVoice 2 \nFinally, the SPLC encourages people to research their legal rights. Many countries have laws against hate crimes. People who do hate crimes are criminals. The law can punish them.\nVoice 1 \nThe fight against hate includes all people. Every person can do something. It is important to act against hate. It is important to join forces against hate. And it is important to support the innocent victims of hate.\nVoice 2 \nThis is the third program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn March of 2018, many people in London, England, received some troubling letters. People in other communities, like Birmingham, and Leicester, got these letters too. These letters were encouraging people to take part in an event. This event was called “Punish a Muslim Day”. The letter told people to do acts of violence against Muslims. The person who wrote the letters wanted to get lots of people to join.\n\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThe Muslim community in England was very upset by these letters. Tell MAMA is a group based in England. They support victims of anti-Muslim hate. Iman Atta was the director of Tell MAMA. She told Sky News,\nVoice 3 \n“This has caused quite a lot of fear within the community. People are asking if they are safe. They are asking if their children are safe to play outdoors.”\nVoice 1 \nThese letters made people afraid. It was probably easier to not talk about them. In many situations people do not talk about hate crimes. But there are ways to fight hate.\nImage by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the second in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 1 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. Today’s Spotlight is on the second way to fight hate in your community: Join Forces.\nVoice 2 \nManzoor Ali was a resident of Manchester and a Muslim. He owned a cafe in Manchester, England. When he heard of these letters, he was hurt. He decided to do something. His family planned a different day. The day they planned was called “Banish Hate Day.” On this day, he encouraged people to be kind. His shop gave away free tea, cake and other treats. Ali told The Manchester Evening News:\nVoice 4 \n“We will not let small-minded people set us against each other. Instead, our arms and doors are open – even to those minds that incite hate. Get to know us, and our community. Join us in our community work. Use that negative energy to do good.”\nVoice 1 \nShahab Adris heard of these letters too. He wrote another letter. But this letter encouraged people to participate in “Love a Muslim Day.” He encouraged people to support Muslims instead of hurting them. He suggested that people could take Muslim friends to get coffee. Or invite a Muslim friend over to hang out.\nA response. Happy Mothers Day everyone!#LoveaMuslimDay #UnityinDiversity pic.twitter.com/rN7VF6m8BU— RJ Shahab Ud'deen (@5haha8) March 11, 2018 \nVoice 2 \nMuslims and non-Muslims responded to his letter. They said they would join. They created community events where people could come together and celebrate “Love a Muslim Day.” Adris told the Huffington Post:\nVoice 5 \n“In the face of extreme hatred, it is important to stay positive. And show some creativity. We must rise above it. We must be active and show compassion and love to our fellow citizens.”\nVoice 1 \nSometimes bringing people together is a difficult job. People who experience hate often feel afraid or alone. People who want to fight against hate may not know how to start. The Southern Poverty Law Center says that people should always remember one thing. People around you also want to stop hate. That is why it is so important to unite and join forces.\n\nSee the Advanced version of this program\nVoice 2 \nEveryone knows that there is power in numbers. Many people have a louder voice than only one person. More people can do more things. They can educate more people. Criminals may also be less likely to attack a larger group of people. And more people also means more ideas! Every person can add something. So how can you join forces? How can you find people to connect to?\nVoice 1 \nThe SPLC says that there are many ways to join forces with other people. You can start by joining with people who you are already close to. Gather with your friends and family. Ask the people who live near you, your neighbours, to join your group against hate. Invite the people you work or worship with.\nVoice 2 \nRemember also to join with people who are different to you. Uniting can bring together every person of a community. When you see hate, encourage your group to act against it. Meet together and talk about ways to make your group grow. Talk about ways to educate your community about people who are different.\nVoice 1 \nYou can also work with larger groups in your community. What groups in your community might want to stop hate? The SPLC suggests inviting and involving women’s groups, teachers, labour unions, university workers, and young people groups. Involve schools, businesses, places of worship, children, members of minority groups and politicians. They also encourage people to involve local police. Police can watch for early signs of hate in a community.\nVoice 2 \nThat is what people in London did when those letters arrived. These letters encouraged people to hurt each other. They wanted to divide people. But the people in these communities did not divide. The police departments encouraged people to turn in the letters if they received them. The police went out to find who sent the letters. Angela Williams, from the West Yorkshire police, told these communities:\nVoice 6 \n“Our communities should be careful. But do not be frightened. We are stronger when we stand together as one and will not be divided.”\nVoice 1 \nAnd the community did stand together. In response, people like Manzoor Ali and Shahab Adris joined forces. Some people posted on social media. They made a hashtag: #WeStandTogether. They volunteered to walk people home from work or school. Some people made leaflets and online posts about what to do if you see a hate crime.\nImage by Martin Foskett from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSadly, hate exists in every community. But there are many ways that people can stand up and join forces against it. Remember that you are not alone.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the second program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nOn August 12, 2018, Hawk Newsome was visiting Washington DC, in the United States. He was walking with a crowd of people. They were all a part of an eight-day march. This peaceful protest was called the Agape March.\nVoice 2 \nAgape is a Greek word that means “love”. But agape is not just any kind of love. This love means that we give of ourselves for others. When we practice agape love, we are seeking the best for another person — even through our own sacrifice. The goal of the Agape March was to spread love. This kind of love is the opposite of hate.\nVia Instagram\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the first in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at 10 ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. Hate can lead people to do horrible things, like hate crimes. A person commits a hate crime because he hates that the other person is different. Hate crimes can take many different forms. Hate crimes may be violent. Or they may be non-violent. But they are very damaging to people and communities. They always are meant to scare or hurt other people.\nVoice 1 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate in your community. In today’s program we will look at the first way to fight hate in your community: Act.\nVoice 2 \nHawk Newsome wanted to act because of what he had seen a year before. One year before, in Charlottesville, Virginia, a hate group formed rallies and shouted hateful words. Violence broke out between the hate group and protesters. During the violence, a man drove his car into the protestors. He killed a woman and injured 19 more people. This incident affected Newsome. This is why he began the Agape March. He told Newsweek,\nVoice 3 \n“I was in Charlottesville last year. I saw the tear gas, the rocks, and the guns. I saw the power of hate. What I want to see now is the power of love.”\nAlt-right members carry Nazi and Confederate Flags in Charlottesville hate rally; “Charlottesville ”Unite the Right” Rally” (CC BY 2.0) by Anthony Cride\nVoice 1 \nHate crime happens in many places around the world. Maybe you have seen or experienced a hate crime for yourself. People who observe or experience hate crimes often feel helpless or alone. But it is important to remember that you do have the power to stop hate. You are not alone. Many people in your community also want to stop hate.\nVoice 2 \nImagine if you read about the violence in Charlottesville. What would you have done? The Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, says that when you observe a hate crime you could react in two different ways. First, you could do nothing. You could continue living your life as you are. Or you could react in a completely different way. You could do something. They suggest that you “rise up, speak up and stand up against hate.” People must act out against hate crimes. Hate will continue if people do not act.\nVoice 1 \nPeople who commit crimes because of hate are not only attacking one person or group. The hate crime in Charlottesville influenced the whole community. Hate tears communities apart. When communities are in conflict, all members of the community suffer. Experts say that hate crimes encourage community conflict and riots more than any other crimes.\nVoice 2 \nSo, the SPLC suggests that people should react to hate crimes by doing good things. In one city in West Virginia, vandals wrote words of hate on the outside wall of a building. A teacher at a school nearby discussed this act of vandalism with his students. The children wanted to fight this form of hate crime. They decided to paint over the hateful words. The vandals sent a message of hate. But the students sent another message. They sent a message saying that they did not want hate in their community.\nVoice 1 \nPeople who commit hate crimes can see if people do not react. The students reacted. The criminals could see that the community did not agree with their words of hate.\nPhoto by Alice Donovan Rouse from StockSnap\nVoice 2 \nWhat can you do to fight hate in your community? That is not an easy question. But there are many things to try. You can lead a prayer, paint over vandalism, or speak in your place of worship, or school. You can work with others to lead a meeting in your community and think of ideas to stop hate crimes. You can organize a rally. Gather many people together to protest hate. If you are an artist, offer to make materials to inform other people about the anti -hate rallies. If you play an instrument offer to perform at a concert to raise money to fight hate.\nVoice 1 \nHawk Newsome saw the power of hate. He was sad and angry because of the injustice he had seen. He believed that a change was necessary. Otherwise, more violence like the kind people saw in Charlottesville would happen again. He wanted to make a difference. So he worked with other people to make the Agape March. He told Newsweek:\nClick here to listen to the Advanced version of this program.\nVoice 3 \n“This march is an exercise of love. A revolutionary love. With it, we seek to truly change America.”\nVoice 2 \nHate separates a community – but you can help bring it back together. As the SPLC says: “In the face of hate, silence is deadly.” We cannot stay still and silent when hate is around us. We must act.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the first program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nSome people drink it with food in the afternoon.  \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it to give themselves energy in the morning.  \nVoice 1\nSome people drink it as part of a ceremony.  \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it when they are sick.  \nVoice 1\nSome people drink it hot. \nVoice 2\nSome people drink it very cold.  \nVoice 1\nPeople have been drinking it for hundreds of years, in hundreds of countries. What is it? Tea!\nVoice 2\nTea comes from the camemellia senensis plant. People pick the leaves off the plant. They set the leaves to dry. The tea leaves are ready when all the water from the leaves is evaporated.  There are many ways to prepare the leaves before making the tea drink. Some tea leaves are left open to the air before they are dried. This makes the leaves darker. They will taste stronger. Some people mix tea leaves with flowers, oils, and other plants to give teas different tastes. The people who originally discovered tea developed these methods many years ago.\nVoice 1\nThe story of tea begins in China. Chinese history says that over five thousand years ago, Chinese emperor Shen Nung discovered tea. Stories say that a dry leaf from the tea plant fell into the emperor’s cup of hot water. The emperor saw that his water turned dark. He tasted the water and liked it. This was the first cup of tea.\nVoice 2\nHowever it started, tea became very popular in China. People believed that tea was healthy. People in China also created many different ways to prepare tea. In fact, a man named Lu Yu wrote a book just about tea, late in the eighth century.\nVoice 1\nShortly after this, tea travelled to Japan. Japanese Buddhist priests travelled to China. And they brought tea back with them. In Japan, people developed special ceremonies to serve tea. Serving tea became a new form of art. It was most common among wealthy people.\nVoice 2\nTea was an important part of both Chinese and Japanese culture. It had travelled to other Asian countries too. But tea had not yet travelled anywhere else in the world. Finally, in the late fifteen hundreds, Portuguese travellers brought small amounts of tea back to Europe. Portugal was one of the first European countries to trade with China. Portugal worked with the Netherlands to move the tea through Europe. Dutch ships took tea to France and other countries on the Baltic Sea.\nVoice 1\nOnly very wealthy people had enough money to drink tea in Europe. It took many months to transport the tea from Asia. And only a limited amount was transported. But more countries started to trade with China. They also brought tea back to Europe. Prices became lower, and more people could drink tea.\nVoice 2\nToday, England is the European country most known for tea. British traders started shipping tea to England in the late 1600s.Tea trade had become a very profitable business. England imported about 18,000 kilograms of tea a year in 1699. Ten years later, the country imported six times that amount of tea!\nVoice 1\nBritish colonists also brought tea wherever they settled. Tea became very important in India. It is still a very important crop there. And Indian tea is known around the world.\nVoice 2\nTea played an important part in one British colony you might know. This colony is now known as the United States of America. England sent tea to America. But, as time went on, England raised the taxes on the tea and other goods it sent. The people living in the colonies did not like these taxes. To protest the high taxes, a group of colonists took a large shipment of tea and threw it into the ocean. Today, this event is known as “The Boston Tea Party”. It was one of the most important events in the American Revolution.\nVoice 1\nTea has also changed over many years. In the past, people drank tea by putting the leaves directly into the water. But around 1908 an American inventor developed a new method – tea bags. Thomas Sullivan put the tea in a small silk bag. This bag of tea could be put directly into the hot water.\nVoice 2\nAt first people in Britain did not like tea bags. But, during World War Two, people could not get their normal tea. So they had to use tea bags. Today most tea bags are made of paper. And they are very popular in many parts of the world.  \nVoice 1\nToday, people on every continent drink tea. But people in different places drink tea differently. In the United Kingdom, tea became part of the daily meal.\nVoice 2\nTraditionally, two meals involved tea in British homes. These meals became popular in the 1600s [sixteen hundreds]. The first was afternoon tea – or “low tea.” This was popular among wealthy people. They would drink tea and eat small sandwiches of meat and bread. This meal happened around three o-clock in the afternoon. The other meal was called “high tea.” High tea was a larger meal eaten later in the night. It was popular among poorer people.\nVoice 1\nIn Western Asia and the Middle East, a popular way to enjoy tea is as Masala Chai. Masala Chai is a drink made from black tea. But this drink has sugar, spices and milk in it. \nVoice 2\nAround the world people boil plants and flowers to make drinks similar to tea. These are called tisanes. A tisane is any drink made from hot water and any plant material, except from the tea plant. They are also often called herbal teas.\nVoice 1\nIn areas of South America people enjoy a particular tisane. The drink is called Mate. People make it from the leaves of the yerba mate plant. A person puts dry yerba mate leaves into a dry gourd. This is a container made from a dried vegetable skin. He then adds water to the gourd. He drinks the liquid through a thin metal tube – a bombilla.\nVoice 2\nPeople in Southern Africa make a drink called rooibos. This hot drink is made similar to tea. But instead of tea leaves, it uses the leaves from the rooibos plant. The drink is a red color and is often called red tea.  \nVoice 1\nHowever you drink tea, the next time you have a cup, think of all the people around the world who are joining you!

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of an old man. The man is crouching on the edge of the sun. All around him there is only darkness. There is nothing but this man and an empty world. In his hand, the man holds a tool called a compass. This is a tool people use to create perfect circles on paper. Builders use them to design buildings. Usually, compasses are made of steel. But this compass is made of gold. And the man is not using it on paper. He draws with the compass on the emptiness around him. His long white hair blows in the wind.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called Ancient of Days. It is by the English poet and painter, William Blake. Blake painted it in 1794. The painting shows Blake’s version of the creation of the universe. Here a being like the Christian God designs the world from nothing. \nVoice 1\nLike many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.\nToday’s Spotlight is on William Blake.\nVoice 2\nWilliam Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:\nVoice 3\n“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“\nVoice 2\nWe do not know if Blake really saw these things. We do not know if he only imagined them. We do not know if he saw something he could not explain. But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.\nVoice 1\nBlake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:\nVoice 4\n“I attempted every morning for two weeks to follow your directions. But I found all of my attempts were unsuccessful. So, I decided to show an independence that I know will please you better. I will not follow the path of another, however wonderful that path may be. At any rate, my excuse must be: I could not do anything else. It was out of my power!”\nVoice 2\nDoctor Trussler was not happy with Blake’s new direction. He told Blake the images were not realistic. Trussler refused to have Blake work for him again.\nVoice 1\nBut though Blake was not wealthy, he continued to make his own art. He created his own way of engraving on copper. And, he began writing poetry. Blake created many books of poetry. And, he would make images to go along with his poems. Some of these books were about the future as Blake imagined it.\nVoice 2\nBut he also wrote poems about love and wonder. One of Blake’s best known poems is called The Tyger. It is from his book Songs of Innocence and Experience. Nick Page reads part of Blake’s poem.\nVoice 5\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\nVoice 1\nBlake’s poem speaks about the creation of a tiger. He compares the process to making steel or iron. This process, called forging, is dangerous. It needs a lot of heat and strength. Blake wonders who could create such a powerful thing. He asks who would have that kind of strength.\nVoice 2\nBlake died in 1827. At that time, few people knew who he was. But soon Blake’s work gained wider recognition. People saw his paintings as strange when he was alive. But today we recognize that these works are one of a kind. Blake’s paintings are powerful markers of faith and creativity. His poems also influenced many writers.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake did not seem to care about popularity. He believed in his art. And he believed in the things he saw. He felt it was important to express what he believed. And he worked toward doing this with everything he had.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nEvery year, on March 17th, the city of Chicago in the United States, does something unusual. They change the colour of the river that runs through the city. They use food colouring to turn the water green! They use about 18 kilograms of this vegetable-based dye for the water. They do this to celebrate an Irish saint – Saint Patrick.\nVoice 2\nMany Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations involve a lot of food and drinks. Some of the food and drinks are green too. Another tradition is to wear green. And if you do not, someone may just pinch you. They may pull a little bit of skin between two fingers. But Chicago is only one place that celebrates Saint Patrick – people in cities and countries around the world celebrate him.\nVoice 1\nBut who is Saint Patrick? And why do people celebrate him on March 17th every year? Today’s Spotlight is on Saint Patrick and his holiday.\nVoice 2\nSaint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland. He is known for his religious work on that island. Historical church documents tell us some things about his life. But he also recorded his life and passion for his Christian faith in his letters.\nVoice 1\nSaint Patrick was bornin Britain around the year 386. At this time, the Roman Empire in Britain was ending. Violent groups from Ireland invaded the land. They stole land, money, animals, objects and even people. When Patrick was 16, people from Ireland raided his family’s home. They took Patrick and held him as a slave. He was kept in Ireland for six years. There, he worked as a shepherd and spent most of his time out in the fields caring for sheep Patrick wrote in his letters that he depended on God when he felt lonely or afraid.\nVoice 2\nAfter being held for six years, Patrick escaped. In his letters, he writes that he had a strange dream. In the dream, he heard the voice of God telling him to leave. So Patrick left. He walked almost 322 kilometres toward the Irish coast. There, he was able to get on a ship to Britain and return to his family.\nVoice 1\nIn Britain, Patrick studied to become a Christian priest. He lived with other religious men, as a monk. But then, Patrick’s writings say that he had another dream, this time from an angel. This angel told Patrick to go back to Ireland.\nVoice 2\nHistorical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.\nVoice 1\nHe also added a circle to the common Christian cross. This became the Celtic cross or the cross of Ireland. The circle was the symbol of the sun. The sun was a powerful Irish symbol for many people. Patrick combined the circle and cross. This showed that Jesus was like the sun.\nVoice 2\nSt. Patrick is also closely connected to the green shamrock plant. It has three leaves. It is often used as a symbol of Ireland. Some stories suggest that St. Patrick used this plant to teach people the Christian idea of the Trinity – that God is three but also one.\nVoice 1\nBut just how did the world start celebrating St. Patrick’s day on March 17th every year? That is because March 17th is the anniversary of St. Patrick’s death. He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day. Then they returned home to eat, drink and dance.\nVoice 2\nAs Irish people moved to other countries, the traditions went with them. The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was in New York City, in the United States, in the year 1762. Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.\nVoice 1\nIn the 17-and 1800’s, large groups of Irish immigrants moved to the United States. This spread Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations to many communities there. But the United States and Ireland are not the only placed that celebrate this holiday. People in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Japan and Russia all celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. People have even celebrated this day on the International Space Station!\nVoice 2\nBut the biggest celebrations today are in Ireland. It has been a public holiday there since 1903. Today, in the city of Dublin, about one million people take part in Saint Patrick’s Festival. This celebration is five days long! It includes parades, music, dancing, outdoor plays, fireworks and more!\nVoice 1\nIn the past, Saint Patrick’s Day was mainly a religious celebration. Until the 1970’s, Irish law even said that the bars must be closed on March 17th. But now in most places, it is more a celebration of Ireland and Irish culture. But no matter why you celebrate, make sure to wear green on March 17th – or you may get pinched!\nVoice 2\nDo people celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day where you live? Do you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Lots of people say – how can you work out in the wild when you are a woman? But I can do anything I want.  Many other people, especially young women like us, they want to join us. I am a woman. I am going to have a baby. I want my baby to see a rhino. That is why I am protecting it.”\nVoice 1\nLeitah Michabela said this to The Guardian newspaper. Michabela is part of a group in South Africa called The Back Mambas. They work to protect wild animals, particularly one special animal – the rhinoceros, or rhino. Today’s Spotight is on The Black Mambas of South Africa.\nVoice 2\nSouth Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.\nVoice 1\nRhinos are protected by the laws of the country. But people still hunt them. Some people think that the rhino horn has special powers. They will pay a lot of money for it. Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.\nVoice 2\nIn Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.\nVoice 1\nBut even with punishments and armed rangers, the rate of rhino deaths in Kruger Park was still very high. Authorities needed another solution to save the rhinos. So they formed a new group in a nearby area called Balule Nature Reserve. This group has reduced trapping and poaching in their area by 76 percent!\nVoice 2\nThis new force is made up only of women. They are named the Black Mambas after a deadly kind of snake. The Black Mambas do not carry guns. Instead they concentrate on protecting the animals and natural environment in the Park. Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Black Mambas. She explains to The Guardian why her group is so important.\nVoice 4\n“There were men rangers carrying guns. But still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached.\nI think they said, ‘Let us start something and add women and see what happens.’ Women are more loyal to their jobs. So they feel very strongly about what they do.”  \nVoice 1\nIn 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.\nVoice 2\nSince 2013, the Mambas have patrolled the metal fence which marks the Park area. They watch for poachers. They remove traps, or snares, set by poachers. And they report everything they see. The Mambas also go into the community. There, they educate people, especially children, about protecting animals.\nVoice 1\nAnd the women of the Black Mambas have made a big difference. The Guardian says in the six months before they began, 16 rhinos were killed in Balule. In the year after the Black Mambas started, only three rhinos were killed. Siphiwe Sithole says:\nVoice 4\n“The Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching. We have zero acceptance of rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”\nVoice 2\nPeople all over the world have noticed the Black Mambas’ success. The New York Times published pictures of them. They won an award from the UK organization Helping Rhinos. And the UN gave them the Champions of the Earth prize in 2015 for their courage. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Achim Steiner said:\nVoice 5\n“Their many successes are a result of their great courage and strong desire to make a difference in their community. The Black Mambas are an inspiration, not only locally, but across the world to all those working to stop the ugliness of the illegal wildlife trade.”\nVoice 1\nWinning awards like this shows people that it is possible to prevent poaching. It also shows local people that the Black Mambas are valuable. Mamba Felicia Mogakane explains:\nVoice 6\n“It is about knowing that people in South Africa love and are thankful fo what we are doing. They are so happy that there are Mambas. Some years ago, they used to say this job is for men. Now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job. Jobs are limited in South Africa. So this is a big chance for me because I am able to take care of my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe Black Mambas are doing important work to save rhinos. But they are also doing important work in their communities. They are supporting their families by earning money. And people respect and honour them because of the work that they do. The Black Mambas show that communities and nature can work together. They bring hope for both people and animals in South Africa. We close our program today with the words of another Mamba, Collette Ngobeni, who share her hope for the future:\nVoice 7\n“If we work together as a community, we can solve this problem. People need to open their minds and their hearts. It is not about money. It is about our culture, our future.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIto wakes up at 6 in the evening. He wears the same clothes that he did yesterday. His crowded room is filled with empty drink bottles and food wrappers. A huge desk takes up one side of the room. When Ito wakes, he does not get ready for class. He does not get ready for work. Instead, he goes to his computer. And, he plays video games for the entire day Sometimes, his mother comes to bring him food. He thanks her, but says nothing else. Ito’s life is the same the next day, and the next. He has lived without seeing other people for the past three years.\nVoice 2\nIto is one of Japan’s hikikomori. A hikikomori is someone in Japan who withdraws from society. Usually, these are young men. They isolate themselves from other people. And they depend on their parents to survive. Today, there may be a million people living like Ito. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on the Hikikomori.\nVoice 1\nJapan has a very unique society. Traditionally, parents and children live together for many years. Several generations often live together at a time. And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.\nVoice 2\nBut people do not become Hikikomori because they do not want to work. It is usually because of a great pain. A hikikomori might have lost a job. Or, they might be bullied in school. They see these events as failures. And, once they have failed, it is difficult to try again. Masaki Ikegami is a journalist who writes about the hikikomori. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 3\n“The Japanese society makes it difficult for people to succeed once they have made a mistake. I think most hikikomori have had difficulty with their working life. They have been hurt by their human relationships there. Other cases might be people who have had bad experiences at school.  Or, they have been through troubles, accidents, or illnesses. Some have stopped working to stay at home and look after their aging parents. There are many different reasons. It can happen at any age.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori isolate for economic reasons. After the second World War, Japan’s economy grew quickly. College graduates got jobs easily. A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work. Or, they did not find work at all. This economic time period is known as the lost decades.\nVoice 2\nThe lost decades hurt a lot of people. In Japan, much of a person’s self-worth is based on their job. Not having a job, or not doing well in a job, causes a lot of shame. And some people feel so worthless that they stop trying at all. Naohiro Kimura was a hikikomori for ten years. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 4\n“If you finish University in Japan but do not get a job, people look at you strangely. People have a strong sense that you should be working. I was embarrassed. I did not want anyone to see me. When I saw someone wearing nice clothing, I would feel like I had caused trouble. I hated seeing working people. I would compare myself to them. It would make me feel very bad. I felt a strong sense of shame.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori also have depression, a kind of extreme sadness. Often, a depressed person will want to move. They will want to work on things. But they feel that they have no worth. They believe their efforts will not change anything. So, they feel even worse, and become more depressed. It is difficult to recover from this way of thinking.\nVoice 2\nVosot Ikeida is a hikikomori in his fifties. He became a hikikomori when he returned to Japan after living in a different country. He felt that he could not fit into Japanese society. So, he became very depressed. He told the Japan Times,\nVoice 5\n“I closed all the curtains. But the light outside still reflected on the curtains. I could see it from the back of the room. It felt like society was continuing on without me. That feeling made me lonely and insecure. Curtains were not enough. So I blocked more light from my windows. I made it like a cave. It made no difference whether I slept in the daytime or nighttime.”\nVoice 1\nHaving a hikikomori child is also very difficult for parents. Many feel that they must continue to support their children. But they also feel responsibility. Most do not know how to help. And some fear talking about their children, because they also feel shame. Maika Elanis a photojournalist. She helped document the lives of many hikikomori. She told Muse Magazine:\nVoice 6\n“Parents know that people will see them differently if they talk about their children’s lifestyle. They expect them to return to normal for months or years before seeking help. Most parents feel that a hikikomori child shows they have failed. Having someone help with it islike getting rid of your responsibility as a parent. It is like getting rid of your child.”\nVoice 2\nOnce a person becomes a hikikomori, it is very difficult to go back to normal life. Most do not know how to live by themselves. And, they do not have the skills to find a new job. The Japanese government has opened up some jobs for hikikomori. And there are special programs to teach them skills, like cooking.\nVoice 1\nBut the most helpful programs for the hikikomori help them find friends. After all, a person who is lonely or depressed does not only need a doctor. They do not only need help with getting a job. They need someone who will tell them the truth. They need someone who will try and understand them. To make them feel like they are not alone.\nVoice 2\nDo you know anyone who is lonely?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nWhat time do you usually go to bed? How many hours do you sleep each night? Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night?\nVoice 2  \nSleeping traditions may be stranger than you know. For example, in the past, some people had two different sleeps every night. They would wake up in the middle of the night to talk or pray or do quiet activities. But today, most people just have one sleep for about eight hours at night. However, there is no correct way to get enough sleep in a day. People around the world have different customs for sleeping at night, and during the day. Today’s Spotlight is on one particular sleep tradition called the siesta.\nVoice 1  \nSiesta is a Spanish word. It means “nap” or short sleep. In this custom people sleep for a short time after eating their mid-day meal. A sleep like this is often a tradition in places where it is very hot in the middle of the day. People work in the morning and then rest. Then, after their siesta, they go back to work until later in the evening.\nImage by Catharina77 from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nThe siesta is a tradition from Spain. But other places also have this custom, including other Mediterranean countries in Southern Europe. People in countries with Spanish influence may also take siestas, like in the Philippines and some Latin American countries. In this program, we will look at the siesta in Spain and how it may change in the future.\nVoice 1  \nNormal working hours are different in different places around the world. In some countries, many people start work at 7:00 a.m. – in the morning – and do not come home until 7:00 p.m. – at night. In other countries, workers are expected to work from nine a.m. until five p.m.\nVoice 2  \nBut in Spain, many people start work at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning. Then offices close for a couple hours in the afternoon at about 2:00. And people go back to work from about five until eight or nine at night.\nVoice 1  \nThis system began when Spain was an agricultural country. Many people worked outside in the field. These workers could not work well in the early afternoon. It was too sunny and hot. So they took a long break after eating lunch until it was cooler. But today, the economy of Spain is no longer mainly agricultural. People do not need to break when it is hot. But some people still take a break in the middle of the day.\nVoice 2  \nSome people think that the siesta is a good custom. It gives people time to rest in the middle of the day. And there is some scientific evidence that taking naps can make people’s bodies and minds work better. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA did a famous scientific study in the 1990s. They studied how airplane pilots performed after they took naps and when they did not nap. NASA found that naps provided a 34% increase in pilot performance. Naps also provided a 100% increase in physiological alertness. Of course, not everyone needs to be as alert, or awake and able to react quickly as the pilot of an airplane! But many individuals, organizations and companies are interested in how to make people happy and able to work hard.\nVoice 1  \nEven though a siesta might be helpful, it does not work for everyone. Some businesses do not let people stop working. Some people live far from the city and cannot go home during the day. Other people use the time to do small personal errands or shopping. The result is that a lot of people in Spain are not getting enough sleep.\nImage by Bartłomiej Koc from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nThe people of Spain also get less sleep because of Spain’s special time. Spain is one hour ahead of the countries around it. In the 1940s, Spain’s leader changed the country’s time to match with Germany. And since then Spain has not changed its official time. The Parliament of Spain studied this issue. They released a document that explained why this was a problem:\nVoice 3  \n“We sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization suggests. All this has a negative effect on productivity, missing days of work, stress, accidents and the rates of people leaving school. Our day is influenced more by the sun than by the clock. We eat at 1:00 in the afternoon and at eight in the evening, by the sun. But the clock says it is 3:00 and 10:00.”\nVoice 1  \nPeople in Spain are talking about changing the official time of the country. They are also talking about changing the hours of the working day. This would take away the siesta. The Prime Minister of Spain is Mariano Rajoy. In 2016, he suggested moving the hours of the working day so that people can go home earlier.\nVoice 2  \nSome people think that this is a good idea. They think that if people end work earlier they will get more sleep. People may also be able to take better care of their families. It can be difficult to care for children in the evening if parents have to work until later.\nVoice 1  \nSpain has struggled with this problem for a few years. Ignacio Buqueras is a Spanish economist who supports changing working hours. He thinks that without a siesta, Spain will have a better economy that can produce more with less effort. In 2014, he told the New York Times newspaper:\nVoice 4  \n“We want to see a more efficient culture. Spain has to break the bad habits that have increased over the past 40 or 50 years.\nVoice 2  \nBut siesta time is also very important for the culture of Spain. During the siesta, families take time to eat together. Friends spend hours talking. Without a siesta, this time is gone. There are both good and bad things about siesta time. But one thing is certain – it is difficult to change the schedule of a whole country!\nImage by Eida Martinez from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nWhat are normal working hours where you live?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nDo you like hearing scary stories? See our program Telling Scary Stories.\nVoice 1  \nEvery October 31st children all across the United States do something strange. They imagine they are someone or something else. They put on strange clothes. They may even paint their faces or wear false hair. They walk around from house to house. They knock on the door of the house. When someone opens the door all the children say the same thing:\nTrick or treat!\nImage by April Bryant from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nThe person in the house gives them a sweet candy treat! The children do this again and again for one house to the next. This is the holiday of Halloween. Today’s Spotlight is on Halloween – and other holidays like it.\nVoice 1  \nThe tradition of Halloween is very old. In fact, people who study history believe that Halloween traditions began as long as 2,500 years ago. They believe these traditions started in ancient Ireland, with the Celtic people.\nVoice 2  \nThe Celts of Ireland counted two parts of the year. The bright half of the year was summer. And the dark half was winter. They believed that the bright half of the year ended around October 31. After this day, winter was coming. The Celtic people called this change in season Samhain, which means the ‘end of summer.’\nVoice 1  \nSamhain was a special time. It was both a celebration of the end of summer, or life, and the beginning of winter, or death. So it was also a frightening time. The Celts believed that there was a natural barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead. But, at Samhain, the barrier disappeared. They believed that spirits could rise from the dead and come among the living.\nVoice 2  \nHistorians say that during the celebration of Samhain the Celts dressed themselves in different clothes. They walked through their villages making lots of noise. And they caused disorder in the village. They believed that this frightened the spirits away. Some historians also believe that the Celts sacrificed humans or animals during this celebration as a warning to the spirits.\nVoice 1  \nOther people groups in other parts of the world also celebrated similar holidays. Around the year 400, Christians came to Ireland. They began to celebrate Christian holidays at the same time the Celts celebrated their holidays.\nVoice 2  \nFor many years the Christians had a celebration in honour of saints – special people in the Church. They called this celebration ‘All Saints Day,’ or ‘All Hallows Day.’ It was a day to celebrate these special saints, or ‘holy,’ people. They celebrated ‘All Hallows Day’ on November 1st.\nVoice 1\nThe night before a special day is called an “eve”. After a time, people began calling the Samhain celebration ‘All Hallows Eve.’ Since language is always changing, people soon shortened the name. Instead of ‘All Hallows Eve’, they called it ‘Halloween’, and that is what we call it today!\nVoice 2  \nIn the 16th century, another tradition began. In the days leading up to the Samhain celebration, the people of Ireland and Britain dressed in different clothes. They went house to house. At each house, they sang songs to the dead. Then the people of the house gave them small sweet cakes.\nImage by Oberholster Venita from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nIrish settlers brought Halloween traditions to the United States in the middle 1800’s. But people there did not really celebrate Halloween until almost 100 years later – during the early 1900’s. For most children today in the US, Canada, the UK and other places, Halloween is about candy and fun clothes. But other people have a day like this to celebrate the people who have lived and died before us.\nVoice 2  \nMany countries have a celebration to remember people who have died. Some celebrations are at different times of the year. They do not always call these celebrations ‘Halloween’. But the celebrations have similar meanings. So, how do you celebrate Halloween?\nVoice 1  \nOn Halloween in Belgium, there are parades and scary decorations like spiders and ghosts. But people also light candles. These candles help people remember their dead relatives.\nVoice 2  \nIn the Czech Republic they celebrate Dusicky. People visit the place where a family member is buried.\nVoice 1  \nIn China, people do not celebrate Halloween. But they have a very similar celebration called ‘Yue Lan’. It is the ‘Festival of the Hungry Ghosts.’ The people there believe that spirits visit the world for 24 hours. Some people burn pictures of fruit or money. They believe that the spirits can see these burned pictures. And the burned pictures bring calm and peace to the ghosts. This celebration is not a time for games or dressing up. Instead, it is a day to remember and respect the memory of dead ancestors.\nImage by Darvin Santos from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nIn Mexico, the people celebrate ‘Dia De Muertos’ – ‘the day of the dead.’ Some other Latin American countries also celebrate this holiday. It is not a scary day. It is a time to remember friends and family members who have died. A three-day celebration begins on October 31. During this time, families make special places in their homes to honour their dead friends and family. They place candy, photographs, fresh water, flowers, and food and drink in this special place. They burn candles and strong smelling incense to help spirits find their way home. The last day of the celebration is called ‘All Soul’s Day’. On this day, living family members eat a meal at the gravesite where dead friends and family are buried. They tell stories and remember good times of when the person was alive.\nVoice 1  \nAnd the tradition of Halloween is still popular in Ireland too! Today, on Halloween, Irish boys and girls dress like ghosts, witches, or other frightening creatures. They light big fires. Many children go around to different houses. They ask for fruits, nuts, or sweets.\nVoice 2  \nHalloween can be a lot of fun for children. But is also a good time to remember someone you love who has died. Do you celebrate Halloween?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nIt is early October in Munich, Germany. The air is cool and fresh. The leaves on the trees are starting to change their colors. Bright orange and dark red trees fill the hills around the city.\nVoice 2\nMillions of people are gathered in an open area. The open area is in the center of the city. There are musical performances. The people talk and laugh together. The children enjoy mechanical carnival rides. People wear traditional clothes. They sing and dance. Most importantly, they drink beer together. These people are enjoying Oktoberfest.\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight is on the traditional Bavarian celebration of Oktoberfest.\nVoice 2\nOktoberfest is a traditional festival in Munich Germany. Munich is in the south of Germany in the area of Bavaria. This area is famous for its good-tasting beer. People enjoy this alcoholic drink around the world. Beer is made from simple elements: water, grain, yeast and hops. Yeast causes the mixture to change into alcohol. And hops give beer its particular taste.\nVoice 1\nBavarian beer is famous because of its history. There is evidence to show that this is the oldest beer-producing area in Europe. And many of the beer factories, or breweries, have a very long tradition of making beer. There are 640 breweries in this region!\nImage by motointermedia from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nOktoberfest celebrates this tradition. It also celebrates the traditional culture of Bavaria. The festival begins at the end of September. It starts with a traditional ceremony. The leader of the city of Munich, the mayor, stands in one of the buildings. He holds a metal tube. And he stands in front of a large rounded wooden keg. This container holds the beer. The mayor hits the metal tube, to force it into the keg. The beer flows through the metal tube, and out of the keg. The mayor then shouts in German “It is tapped!” This act officially opens the festival. Oktoberfest continues for 17 or 18 days.\nVoice 1\nAt Oktoberfest, the festival only serves beer made in Munich. Taking part in Oktoberfest is a special honor for the breweries. The beers made for the festival also must have 2% more alcohol than normal beers. They are known as official Oktoberfest Beers.\nVoice 2\nThe people of Munich have celebrated Oktoberfest for more than 200 years. So how did this festival begin? It began with a marriage! In 1810 Prince Ludwig married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Their marriage was very important to the citizens of Munich. They had a parade through the city to celebrate. They played music and danced in the streets. Then the people celebrated and drank beer late into the night. The people of Munich enjoyed this event very much. So the city decided that the festival should happen every year.\nKegs; Image by RitaE from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nEach year, the city has added more events. They added a show for farm products. People brought their best crops and animals to the festival. Judges gave prizes for the biggest and best products.\nVoice 2\nThen the city added horse races to the festival. People gambled money on the horses. People tried to guess which horse would win the race. If their horse won the race, the person won money. Then he could use this money to buy beer! These events became traditions at the festival. They happened every year.\nVoice 1\nAnother important tradition of Oktoberfest is the traditional clothing from Bavaria. Both men and women may wear a Sennerhut. A sennerhut is a traditional hat. It is made with the wool from sheep. It often has a rope around the base. It has symbols from the person’s city or region. Many have flowers embroidered on them with bright cloth thread. Some people also put a small amount of goat hair on their hat. They place it under the rope. This goat hair is said to be good luck.\nVoice 2\nMen wear traditional “lederhosen.” Lederhosen are made from animal skin – leather. They are short trousers for men and boys. They connect to suspenders – thin pieces of leather worn over the shoulders. Across the man’s chest is also a piece of leather. The leather connects the suspenders. This leather piece has images of flowers and animals.\nVoice 1\nWomen wear traditional “dirndls.” Dirndls are special dresses. The dress has four parts. First, there is a white or light-colored shirt. On top of the shirt, a woman wears a bodice. This piece of colored cloth fits tightly to the woman’s chest. Traditional dirndls have a knee-length dress. The woman then ties an apron around her waist on top of the dress. It is meant to keep the clothes under it clean.\nVoice 2\nTraditional lederhosen and dirndls had special meaning. Each region had special cloth they used to make the clothing. Each city and area used special designs and colors. It was always clear what place the person was from.\nImage by Hans Lohrmann from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nSome of the traditional Oktoberfest activities still happen today. Many people still wear the traditional clothes. And every three years, there is still a show of farm products. But there are no longer horse races. Entertainment is also different today. Loud, modern musical groups play rock music into the night. A modern, mechanical carnival replaced traditional games. Now large rides and games light up the night sky.\nVoice 2\nSince the 1960s, Oktoberfest has become very popular internationally. It started as a small celebration. The only people who participated lived in Munich. Now, Oktoberfest is the largest traditional festival in the world. People from all over the world travel to Munich to enjoy the festival. In 2010 there were over 6 million people at Oktoberfest! They drank over 7 million litres of beer!\nVoice 1\nIn 200 years, authorities have only cancelled Oktoberfest a total of 24 times. This has usually been because of war and disease. Most recently, authorities cancelled the festival during World Wars I and II.\nVoice 2\nThe tradition of Oktoberfest is still strong in Munich. It still celebrates the traditions and culture of Bavaria. And it will likely continue for many years in the future. Have you ever celebrated Oktoberfest?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nA woman walks to the beach on Jeju Island, South Korea. She is going to work. The woman wears a black wetsuit that covers her whole body. She has a mask on her face to keep water out of her eyes. She dives deep down into the water. She does not have an oxygen tank. She holds her breath. The woman gathers shellfish from the bottom of the ocean. Then she swims back to the surface with her catch. She will do this up to 100 times this day. And she is 70 years old! This woman is part of the haenyeo. In Korean this means sea women. There are thousands of haenyeo on Jeju Island. Today’s Spotlight is on these strong women of the sea.\n“Haenyeo still in her street shoes at Ilc” (CC BY 2.0) by amanderson2\nVoice 2  \nJeju Island is mostly made of black volcanic rock. Before modern farming equipment, people could not grow much food here. So, they dove into the sea for food. Many creatures live in shells deep in the ocean. The people of Jeju ate and sold this shellfish to support their families. But by the 1600’s many men from Jeju left the island. They went to fight or to work on ships. The work of diving for shellfish became a job for women – the haenyeo.\nVoice 1  \nThe money earned from the haenyeo’s shellfish trade is a large part of Jeju’s economy. But being a haenyeo is also a way of life. They have a deep respect for the ocean. They also have a close connection to each other. And the haenyeo hold a special place in Korean society. Here, it is not common for women to do physical work as the main support for their families.\nVoice 2  \nA haenyeo’s work is very physically and mentally challenging. The sea is very cold. It moves with currents and waves. In the past, women dove in light cotton clothing. Today, the haenyeo have diving masks and wetsuits. But these smell very strongly. And the women are often sick from the sea. Working in the ocean is also very dangerous. They dive up to six hours a day. The haenyeo must hold their breath for up to two minutes at a time. Diving can cause injury and even death. The New York Times reports that in the last ten years more than 40 haenyeo have died.\nVoice 1  \nThis danger is one reason why the number of haenyeo is decreasing. Many modern Korean girls do not want to do such dangerous, physical work. The New York Times reports that in the 1960’s, there were 26,000 haenyeo. There are now only about 4,500. And the working haenyeo are growing old. Eighty-four percent of them are over the age of 60.\nVoice 2  \nBut people are interested in haenyeo culture, both in South Korea and around the world. Brenda Paik Sunoo lives on Jeju Island. She wrote a book called Moon Tides: Jeju Island Grannies of the Sea. She explains to the travel website Roads and Kingdoms:\nVoice 3  \n“Over the past 15 years or so, the respect for the haenyeo has risen. The haenyeo’s gift is not just economic. It is social. It is cultural.”\nBrenda Paik Sunoo at a book reception; “Moon Tides: The Women Divers of Jeju Isl” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by KOREA.NET – Official page of the Republic of Korea\nVoice 1  \nThe haenyeo are an important symbol of traditional culture. They show the values of hard work, independence and community. Some people may look down on the haenyeo because they do physical labour. Other people respect their hard work and position in society. The haenyeo are a special combination of strength and gentleness.\nVoice 2  \nAnd there are some good things about being a haenyeo. They have a way to make money that gives them financial independence. Haenyeo are also part of an important social community. Ji-ae Chae is a young single mother. She used to work in the capital city, Seoul. But she returned to Jeju to work as a haenyeo. She says that the best part of the work is the support from the other women. Chae tells Roads and Kingdoms:\nVoice 4  \n“They take care of my children. It is very good. My children have grandmothers all around them. The women divers are a big community. When I was in Seoul, I did not like people. When I became a woman diver, I liked people again.”\nVoice 1  \nChae is one of the few younger haenyeo. But it is possible that in the future there will be no haenyeo left. It takes a long time to train new divers. And not enough women are making the same choice that Chae has. Yang Hi-bum is a government official on Jeju. He told the New York Times:\nVoice 5  \n“Most of the haenyeo will be gone in 20 years unless more women join them.”\n김형찬 / CC BY 2.0 KR\nVoice 2  \nThe government on Jeju Island is working to save the tradition of the haenyeo. They opened a Haenyeo Museum in 2006. And since 2015, the Jeju government helps the haenyeo pay for equipment and accident and medical insurance. Globally, people also respect and support the haenyeo. In 2016, the divers gained the title of UNESCO Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This recognizes the special spirit of the haenyeo. It also awards their good methods. They are always careful of the environment. Sometimes they do not dive for shellfish, even if they could make a lot of money. This way they protect the natural balance of the ocean. Brenda Sunoo talks about how this also protects the haenyeo:\nVoice 3  \n“They have to use faith to know when to stop. To have enough breath to come up slowly. To not take too much time to take that final sea urchin or abalone that is trapped under the rock.”\nVoice 1  \nThe haenyeo show the world courage and patience. They also show the importance of balance. They must balance their lives above and below water. They must balance the money they get with environmental health. This wisdom and practice of balance keeps the women of the seas alive. The future will show whether their tradition stays alive as well.\nVoice 2  \nHave you ever heard of these women?

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA woman sits on a high, green mountain side in Peru. She watches her animals – a group of sheep and alpacas. She keeps these animals for their hairy wool. The woman is careful to watch the alpaca, but she is also busy in another way. She is weaving wool from the animals to make a colorful cloth. It can be used for clothes, or in a home. She learned this traditional skill from her mother. And she continues to teach her daughters, and other women in her village. She hopes that weaving cloth will create a better future for her community.\nVoice 2\nThe woman is working with the organization Awamaki. Awamaki supports native Quechua communities in Peru. These traditional communities are very poor. But they have a deep cultural history to share with the world. Today’s Spotlight is on Awamaki and their work with the Quechua weavers of Peru.\nVoice 1\nThe Quechua people live in the high Andes mountains in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile. They live a simple life. It is centred on farming and family. They raise sheep. But they also raise many kinds of camelid animals – llamas, alpacas, vicuña, and guanacos. They use these animals for food. But they also use their hairy wool to make clothing and art.\n“Indigenous Weaver” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by Julie Edgley\nVoice 2\nEach kind of camelid animal has a different kind of wool. Llama wool is very rough. They use it mostly for making rope or bags. Vicuña wool is very soft, but can only be harvested every few years. However, people can harvest alpaca wool often. This fine wool is softer and warmer than sheep wool. Baby alpaca wool is the softest and most valued alpaca wool. It is used for fine clothes and scarves for warmth.\nVoice 1\nThe Quechua people also use the wool from these animals to make weavings. Then, they use these weavings to make warm clothes, pieces of art, blankets, and more. The images in Quechua weavings are shared through generations. A weaver repeats images again and again in a weaving. Weavers choose images for their meaning and history. These images include animals, plants, gods, people from history, water, and the stars. The image may not be clear immediately. For example, the whole animal may not appear. The weaver may only show the marks from its feet. A talented weaver combines many different images.\nVoice 2\nAwamaki is based in the town of Ollantaytambo. Ollantaytambo is in what is called “The Sacred Valley” of Peru. This area is high in the Andes between Machu Picchu and Cusco. More than 500 years ago, it was part of the Incan empire – this people group ruled a large area stretching through many countries in South America. Ollantaytambo is a beautiful example of a traditional Incan town. People still use the original Incan walls, farming terraces, and irrigation channels, used to bring water to farms and villages. Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists come through this area each year. They want to see these Incan places, and the Quechua people. Many women in this area weave traditional cloth. And they sell the clothes and other products to tourists. But in the past, they did not get fair prices for their work. They did not know the best things to sell to tourists. And this is how Awamaki helps.\nVoice 1\nAwamaki has four main goals. First, they want to make sure the tradition of Quechua weaving continues. They are helping the Quechua women bring their work to the market, and get a fair price.\nVoice 2\nSecond, Awamaki wants to help the women sell their work around the world. They sell the traditional weaving and clothes over the internet. But Awamaki also connects the women with clothing designers in other countries. They work together to make new and interesting designs.\nVoice 1\nThird, Awamaki also wants to improve the lives of the weavers, their families, and their communities. The women of Awamaki have a regular income. They can depend on earning money each month. The money earned also goes back to their communities. Some of the money is saved in a medical fund for the women and their children. If a medical emergency comes up, the women can use this money to help their families.\nVoice 2\nFinally, Awamaki is helping to save traditional weaving methods. To weave their cloth, Quechua weavers use a backstrap loom. This kind of weaving is special to Quechua weavers. A weaver working with this loom will sit on the ground. One end of the loom attaches to a pole or stick in the ground. The other end of the loom attaches to the weaver by a strap around their back. The backstrap loom is very easy to carry. A weaver can roll it up and take it with her. If she is watching her sheep or llamas in the field, she can bring her loom. If she is visiting friends, she can bring her loom. Awamaki wants to protect this way of weaving.\nVoice 1\nThrough Awamaki, the women also learn new weaving skills. They go on field trips to meet other weavers. By meeting other weavers, they have a chance to learn and improve their skills. Awamaki is also teaching the Quechua women how to use natural dyes. These dyes colour the cloth. In the past, Quechua people dyed all cloth naturally. They would use things like plants, insects, roots, fruits, and seeds. More recently, traders have been bringing new chemical dyes to the weavers. These dyes are cheap. They are also easier – the women do not have to take time to gather and prepare natural dyes.\nVoice 2\nAs a result, many Quechua women forgot or never learned how to use natural dyes. This tradition was about to be lost. But Awamaki trains their weavers to use the natural dyes again. The women are re-learning the old ways of dying wool. The natural colors are much softer, and more beautiful.\nVoice 1\nThese Quechua women are changing their lives. Their work is valued. They earn a fair payment for their weavings. And they can depend on this money each month. They are learning new dying, spinning, and weaving skills. They are able to take care of their families. Through Awamaki, they are building their community.\nVoice 2\nThe writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from the United States.

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Bruce Gulland.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nMercy and Agnes are sisters from Kenya. They are part of the Maasai tribe. They told their story to the organization Equality Now. When they were 10 and 11 years old, they were supposed to take part in a ceremony. This ceremony would celebrate moving from being a girl to a woman. Ceremonies like this are often beautiful and exciting. But Mercy and Agnes were afraid. They knew that this ceremony would also involve cutting their sexual organs.\nVoice 2  \nMercy and Agnes did not want to go through the ceremony. They decided to run away. They received help from some adults they knew. These adults guided them to Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative, or TNI. Tasaru means “rescue” in the local Maa language. There, they met Agnes Pareyio. Today’s Spotlight is on Agnes Pareyio and her work to end female genital mutilation.\nVoice 1  \nWomen all around the world have experienced female genital mutilation, or FGM. FGM involves cutting a woman’s sexual organs. It can involve a small cut, or completely cutting off a woman’s sexual organs. The World Health Organization estimates that 200 million girls have been cut.\nVoice 2  \nThere are no medical reasons to cut. And FGM often causes severe pain, extreme bleeding, and infections. Some girls even die. Even if the girl lives, FGM can cause problems with her body and in childbirth.\nVoice 1  \nGovernments and organizations internationally recognize that FGM is a violation of human rights. However, FGM still happens in many cultures. For many, it is a cultural tradition. People are often strongly attached to these traditions.\nVoice 2  \nThis is why Agnes Pareyio continues her work. Pareyio comes from the Maasai culture in Kenya. When she was 14, her mother told Agnes she would be cut. Agnes did not want to be cut. Her father supported her. But her village did not support her. They made fun of her and called her names. They said they would never accept her. They said no one would marry her.\nVoice 1  \nSo, Pareyio agreed and had her sex organs cut. She bled a lot and was in a lot of pain. But she did not cry, because she did not want to look like she was afraid. Maasai women are not supposed to show fear. Instead, she felt something else. Pareyio told One Billion Rising:\nVoice 3  \n“As I lay there after being cut, I made myself a promise. I was going to do everything I could to stop this ever happening to another girl. My daughters would not be cut. And the daughters of the Maasai would not be cut.”\nVoice 2  \nThis promise has defined Pareyio’s life. FGM was banned in Kenya in 2011. But it continues there. Pareyio works in Kenya to stop FGM, especially with the Maasai. She founded TNI in 1999. It began as a place where girls who ran away from FGM and early marriages could continue their education. But today, two of TNI’s most important programs deal with protecting girls from FGM.\nVoice 1  \nOne of TNI’s programs involves different ceremonies for girls to become women. As a member of the Maasai tribe, Pareyio knows how culturally important FGM is for many women. She wants to offer another choice that protects young girls from FGM but still honors Maasai traditions. The traditional ceremony for Maasai girls to become women is four days long. The girls dress in their best clothes and wear their most beautiful jewelry. They sing traditional songs, and tribal leaders bless the girls with milk and water. A leader performs FGM on the girls. And at the end of the ceremony, the community welcomes them as women.\nVoice 2  \nThe new ceremonies honor the beauty of the tradition while stopping the FGM. All of the elements of the traditional custom are the same except that the girl is not cut. Instead, the girl receives information about the value of education and health.\nImage by Gordon Turibamwe from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nOther organizations also use this method. They keep the good parts of the ceremony. But they replace the cutting with a symbol. Instead of cutting, leaders pour milk on a girl’s legs to represent how she has become a woman. Sarah Tenoi is another Maasai anti-FGM activist in Kenya. She explains the purpose of these new ceremonies to The Guardian:\nVoice 4  \n“We know that if we can change everyone’s mind then we will end FGM. Our message is that we are encouraging people to change one part of Maasai culture, but not give up all of what makes us proud to be Maasai.”\nVoice 2  \nTNI’s other main program is to reconnect girls to their families. Most of the girls who run away from FGM do not want to stay away from their families forever. So Pareyio and her co-workers decided to use a traditional Maasai reconciliation process to return the girls to their families and their village.\nVoice 1  \nThis process involves meeting with parents, family members, and other members of the community. Village leaders and other officials also become involved. Everyone works together and promises not to force the girls to be cut. It is a village-wide promise to protect and support the girls. And it welcomes the girls to come home and become part of the village again.\nVoice 2  \nPareyio explains to The Huffington Post how important it is for entire communities to be involved in these reconciliation ceremonies:\nVoice 3  \n“The ceremonies are a public promise by the girls and their families to keep them away from FGM, early marriage and other dangers that they could face when they are young women, when they are extra vulnerable.”\nVoice 1  \nSix years after they ran away from home, Mercy and Agnes returned to their village through one of these reconciliation ceremonies. They saw their family again and were accepted back into their community. They are no longer afraid of FGM.\nImage by Alex Strachan from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nChanging a culture is a long and difficult process. It involves patience, understanding, and working with many different people. But Pareyio continues to work to end FGM in the Maasai culture, one girl at a time.\nVoice 1  \nWhat about you?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nNext to a church, blue crosses stand in long lines. These crosses mark the place where dead people are buried. This may seem like a sad place. But in the distance, you can hear someone laughing. Today’s Spotlight is on the Merry Cemetery in the town of Sapanta, Romania.\nVoice 2\nA cemetery is a place for dead people. They are buried there when they die. Many European cultures see death as something that is sad and serious. In most places, cemeteries are very serious.\nThe cemetery of Haworth, in the United Kingdom\nVoice 1\nOften, cemeteries are places where people come to remember. They remember friends and family members who are no longer living. A stone marks the place where a person is buried. This stone is a headstone or tombstone. Usually, the headstone is made of a dark rock. The headstone may be flat against the ground or it may stand up.\nVoice 2\nHeadstones often have words on them. The words usually tell some information about the person who died. It tells their name. It also tells the dates when the person was born and when the person died. Sometimes, the headstones include a few words about the person’s life, or some religious words.\nVoice 1\nBut the cemetery in Sapanta is not a normal cemetery. You will not find gray headstones made of rock here. And many of the people visiting the Merry Cemetery are not sad. Merry is another word for happy. For some people, this cemetery is a place to be merry. It is a place to be happy, to laugh.\nVoice 2\nPeople are happy at the Merry Cemetery because of the special headstones. The headstones are made of wood. They are in the shape of crosses. The crosses are as tall as a person and painted a special color called “Sapanta blue”. The colour blue represents the sky. The Romanian people believe the spirit of a person goes to the sky when he dies. A person carves, or cuts, words and pictures into the wood of the headstone.\nVoice 1\nThese carvings show pictures from the life of the person buried there. They paint the carvings with many beautiful colors. Some of the headstones show the person working at their job or doing another thing he enjoyed. Some headstones show how the person died. The words carved into the headstone read as if the person who died is saying them. Here is an example from one headstone. It is about a man who prepared meat for food. The picture shows the man with a large knife in his hand. He is cutting meat. Here is a translation of the headstone:\nVoice 3\nAs I lived in this world,I took the skin of many sheepGood meat I preparedSo you can eat freelyI offer you good fat meatand to have a good desire for food.\nVoice 1\nHere are the words from another headstone:\nVoice 4\nHere lies my mother-in-law.If she had lived another year,It would be me lying here.\nVoice 2\nIt does not sound like that man liked his wife’s mother very much! Some of the pictures and writing on the headstones are full of humour like this. The headstones make people smile as they walk through the cemetery. But why did the people in Sapanta start making these different headstones?\n“Merry Cemetery, Maramures holiday 2011” (CC BY 2.0) by premus\nVoice 1\nWood is a very important material to the people in this area of Romania. For thousands of years, people made their homes from wood. They carved pictures and symbols into their homes. Carving wood is an important part of life.\nVoice 2\nStan Ioan Patras was a wood carver. He is the man who started the Merry Cemetery. Stan’s job was creating carved wood art. In 1934 he started carving wooden headstones. He made them in the shape of a cross. He painted the crosses bright blue. Over the years, more people in the town started using his beautiful crosses as their headstones. He enjoyed learning about the people in his town. When a person died, he would remember what the person was like. He would make a headstone showing part of the person’s life. He made pictures of local culture and wrote about the person’s life. Stan wrote about the bad things and the good things. The headstones showed what the person’s life was truly like.\nVoice 1\nIn the 1950s, a group of people from France travelled through Stan’s town. They visited the cemetery with his headstones. The travelers enjoyed the cemetery very much. They gave it the name “Merry Cemetery.” In 1971, an art museum invited Stan to France to present his headstones in a special presentation. After that, many people visited the Merry Cemetery. In fact, his headstones made the Merry Cemetery one of the most visited cemeteries in Europe! The United Nations cultural organization, UNESCO, declared the Merry Cemetery to be a World Heritage Site. Now it is part of the world’s history. It is a protected place.\n“Merry Cemetery” (CC BY 2.0) by Se.By.\nVoice 2\nPeople from all over the world still come to Sapanta to see the Merry Cemetery. But today, a man named Dumitru Pop Tincu carves the headstones. Stan was his teacher. Dumitru spends most of his time putting new paint on the old headstones. There are almost 800 carved headstones in the cemetery, so this job takes a lot of time. Dumitru also leads visitors around the cemetery. He says that people like the cemetery so much, that they want their own headstones to look like the ones there. Dumitru makes headstones for the people of the town. But he also makes almost as many headstones for visitors.\nVoice 1\nMany people think of cemeteries as sad places. But the Merry Cemetery does not make people feel sad. When a person dies, her friends and family do not only mourn her death. They also celebrate her life. The Merry Cemetery uses colourful pictures and poems to celebrate the person’s life. The Merry Cemetery helps all people to remember the joy of life even in the sadness of death.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Joshua Leo.

This allowed a computer to watch me. My implant used radio waves to communicate with a network of antennas throughout the department. They sent the signals to a computer. It was programmed to respond to my actions. At the main entrance, a voice box said “Hello” when I entered. The computer sensed my movement through the building. It opened the door to my lab for me as I came near to it. It turned on the lights. For the nine days the implant was in place, I performed acts that seemed like magic simply by walking in a particular direction.”\n“Body Hacking Conference, Austin, Texas 2” (CC BY 2.0) by annainaustin\nVoice 1  \nKevin Warwick wrote about this experiment with becoming part machine in WIRED magazine. He is a professor of Cybernetics at the University of Reading in England. The study of Cybernetics looks at controlling systems using technology. Warwick had a silicon chip called an implant.\nVoice 2  \nThere are many people interested in trying this kind of experiment called body hacking. These people want to change their bodies with technology. But there are many questions about it. Today’s Spotlight is on body hacking.\nVoice 1  \nHumans have been making changes to their bodies for many years. Some people have mechanical implants for medical or health reasons. This technology can help their hearts work regularly, or help them to hear. Some people have replaced a missing body part, such as an arm or leg, with a mechanical one. As technology gets better, people can do more. But some people want to go even farther. Professor Kevin Warwick says:\nVoice 3  \n“Since I was a child I have been interested in the study of robots and cyborgs. Now I am in a position where I can actually become one. I believe this desire – this wish to explore – is part of being human.”\nVoice 2  \nKevin Warwick became a cyborg when he had a computer implanted, or put into, his arm. A cyborg is a cybernetic organism. It is a being that is part human and part machine. This sounds like something from a story. But it is a part of life for a small group of people.\nVoice 1  \nAmal Graafstra helps people add technology to their bodies. Graafstra mainly works with small chips or tags that contain electronically stored information. These are called RFID chips. They are as small as a grain of rice. People use them in many ways. They can be used to open doors or help find things that are lost, and many other ways. Graafstra has implanted RFID chips in himself and in many other people.\nVoice 2  \nPeople changing their bodies with technology call themselves “body hackers.” Hacking is a way of breaking into something. Body hackers are exploring the relationship between the natural human body and technology. They try to make their bodies do things beyond what humans can usually do. Graafstra told the news organization NPR:\nVoice 4  \n“Body hackers view the world differently. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what is broken. A patient may someday very soon come and say, ‘My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom.”\nImage by PIRO4D from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nBody hacking takes all kinds of forms. People have put magnets underneath their skin. One man made his finger into a device that connects to computers. This drive stores information. Yet another man attached devices into his head to let him listen to music. Australian artist Professor Stelarc even attached an extra ear – to his arm. These are only a few of the ways that humans have tried to use technology to become “more” than human.\nVoice 2  \nNeil Harbission from Spain was born with a problem with his eyes. He cannot see any colour except grey. So he had an implant made that “plays” colour for him. He has a camera attached to the back of his head. From this, a long curved antenna hangs in front of his face. It makes sound to let him know what colour things are as he sees them. The antenna works so well that Harbission can even see colours that other humans cannot. It is also connected to the internet. Harbisson no longer considers himself human at all. He calls himself a cyborg.\n“Cyborg Neil Harbisson” (CC BY 2.0) by Campus Party Europe in Berlin\nVoice 1  \nHarbission created the Cyborg Foundation. This organization educates people about cyborgs. Not everyone is happy about the cyborg movement. There are many difficult ideas to think about. Some people say that it is too dangerous. This is especially true when people implant machines into themselves without a doctor’s help.\nVoice 2  \nThere is a lot that is unknown about body hacking. No one can know what the result of some implants will be. Many people think that the mix of the human body and technology is too risky. Some body hackers have experienced extreme feelings of unexplained fear after getting their implants.\nVoice 1  \nAnd some people simply believe that the human body should remain as it is. They think it is wrong to change the body from its natural state.\nVoice 2  \nRichard Wordsworth is an expert in bioethics and bioterrorism. He says that technology is already very easy for people to use. He wonders why people would need to put machines INTO their bodies. He also asks about what happens when that technology becomes old. If a device is under a person’s skin, they will need to have surgery to upgrade it.\nVoice 1  \nBut Wordsworth also has other concerns – about safety. Could technology in our bodies actually make us more open to danger? What happens if someone hacks into a person? They could have a lot of power over a body. Wordsworth tells vice.com:\nVoice 5  \n“I already give huge amounts of personal data over to my network provider. But with my phone I can unplug if I want to. I can turn off my handset and put it in a drawer. I could not do this as easily if the technology was buried somewhere in my arm.”\nVoice 2  \nThere are still only a few people who practice body hacking. Will body hacking become a larger movement? And is it worth the danger? For Kevin Warwick, the answer is easy. He tells WIRED:\nVoice 3  \n“My entire team is working with me to bring humans and technology together in a way that has never been attempted. The excitement of looking into a new world – the world of cyborgs – is worth the risks.\nVoice 1  \nThe writer of this programme was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nVu Ngoc Anh stands on a performance stage. Bright lights shine on her from above. Hundreds of people are watching her. They are interested in her beautiful clothing. She is wearing a kind of traditional Vietnamese clothing called an Ao Dai or Ao Dai.\nVoice 2 \nNgoc Anh walks slowly across the stage. Her Ao Dai moves gently side to side. This is because it is made of soft silk – a light, flowing material. The Ao Dai is two pieces of clothing. The bottom part is loose trousers or pants. The top is a long, fitted shirt or gown. Ngoc Anh’s trousers are white. Her gown is a golden, yellow color. It covers her arms, down to her wrists. And it fits tightly around her chest and neck. It is long and hangs almost to the ground. The gown is split at the sides. It opens on the sides from her waist to the floor. As Ngoc Anh walks across the floor, she looks as if she is floating.\nVoice 1 \nOn that night, Vu Ngoc Anh won the 2012 Miss Vietnam Ao Dai competition. The judges thought she looked the most beautiful in her Ao Dai. It is a great honor to achieve the title “Miss Ao Dai”. This is because the Ao Dai is more than just traditional Vietnamese clothing. It is a symbol of the history and beauty of the Vietnamese culture and people. Today’s Spotlight is on the Vietnamese Ao Dai.\nVoice 2 \nThe Ao Dai has a long history in Vietnam. Experts believe forms of the Ao Dai have existed for hundreds of years. It is part of Vietnamese identity. But that does not mean it has stayed the same. The people making Ao Dais have used their designs to react to changes in culture. At different times, French or Chinese culture has influenced Ao Dai designs. Sometimes people changed their designs to be more like other cultures. At other times, people designed Ao Dais to show that Vietnam was a free and independent country.\nVoice 1 \nDuring the 1930s, one of the most famous designers was Nguyen Cat Tuong. He was also known as Le Mur in French. He made a new design that was particularly for women. He was influenced by some of the new French clothing. But what he designed was not French. Instead, it was a new, modern version of the Ao Dai. Before, the Ao Dai was loose and plain. But the new design was more fitted.\nVoice 2 \nThis modern Ao Dai became very popular in parts of Vietnam from 1960-1975. After 1975, Vietnamese women did not wear the Ao Dai as often. The Vietnamese economy was struggling. Most people did not think paying for a nice Ao Dai was necessary.\nVoice 1 \nHowever, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Ao Dai  became popular again. In 1989, a Ho Chi Minh City newspaper began the first “Miss Ao Dai” competition. Sixteen thousand people attended the competition. But this was only the beginning of the Ao Dai’s new popularity. From Ho Chi Minh City, Miss Ao Dai competitions spread around the world. They went to places like Long Beach, California in the United States and the city of Toronto, in Canada. Today, there are many countries that have large populations of Vietnamese immigrants. When these people moved out of Vietnam, they brought the Ao Dai with them.\nPhoto by Héctor J. Rivas\nVoice 2 \nOriginally, each woman’s Ao Dai was made just for her. Ao Dai makers sewed each Ao Dai using only a sharp needle, thread and her hands. A woman visited her Ao Dai maker many times to make sure her Ao Dai fit perfectly. Today, factories produce Ao Dais in large numbers. These Ao Dais are sold in Vietnam and around the world. The export of the Ao Dai has influenced global clothing designers as far away as Paris, France and New York City.\nVoice 1 \nEven now the Ao Dai continues to change. Women want different things from their clothing. They want to keep the Ao Dai. But they want to react to changes in global clothing as well. Still, wearing the Ao Dai has special meaning. Kimlai Yingling is a Vietnamese American writer. On her website, she explained what the Ao Dai meant to her as a child.\nVoice 3 \n“I remember when I was a little girl. I would walk into my mom and dad’s rooms. Behind the door hung long pieces of fabric. I knew these beautiful pieces of material were going to be made into Ao Dais…I remember staring up at my mom when she wore her Ao Dai. I would think how beautiful she looked. I could not wait until I could have an Ao Dai for myself.”\nVoice 2 \nWe asked Vietnamese Spotlight listeners when Vietnamese women wear the Ao Dai. Listener Cong Le explained,\nVoice 4 \n“Women usually wear the Ao Dai during official holiday celebrations.”\nVoice 2 \nListener Trinh Hoang said,\nVoice 5 \n“I think all women in Vietnam wear the Ao Dai at least one time – when they get married.”\nVoice 2 \nAnd Nguyen Tran told us,\nVoice 6 \n“When I studied in high school, I wore the Ao Dai six days each week.”\nVoice 1 \nIn Vietnam, women wear many different colors of Ao Dai. Usually younger women wear light colors. And older women wear darker or bolder colors. Spotlight listener Tuan Anh Nguyen explained,\nVoice 7 \n“Every different Ao Dai color and design shows the beauty and character of the person wearing it. For example, students wear a white Ao dai. This shows purity, innocence, and young beauty. A woman may wear a pink Ao dai at her wedding, when she marries. This shows graceful beauty.”\nPhoto by Rod Long\nVoice 2 \nThe Ao Dai continues to be popular in Vietnam. And people in Vietnam are proud to share the Ao Dai with people around the world. As Tuan Anh writes,\nVoice 7 \n“The Ao Dai is the pride of the nation. It is the pride of every woman, every time she puts it on.”\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen an Ao Dai?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nPeople are eating out at Moomin Café, a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. Some people sit with their friends while they eat. Other people may not have brought friends. But instead of being alone, they are sitting with large stuffed animals. These white animals are not alive. They are toys as large as humans. The toy Moomin is based on a cartoon animal from Finland. They are cute and fun. But they also have another purpose. They help people who come to the restaurant by themselves to feel less lonely.\nMoomin Café in Japanphoto by Hsuanya Tsai\nVoice 2  \nMore and more people around the world eat by themselves. Forbes magazine reports that in the U.S., adults eat nearly half of their meals alone. Some researchers have found that eating alone is not good for people’s health. Others think that it is a good experience to eat meals by yourself. Today’s Spotlight is on eating alone.\nVoice 1  \nIn many places, people feel strange eating out alone. And most restaurants do not have stuffed toys to keep their customers company! But the Telegraph reports that this is changing:\nVoice 3  \n“Eight in ten people in the United Kingdom believe that eating alone is more socially acceptable than it was five years ago. Almost a third of Britons have done so in the last month. And a third of these had done it in the last week. This shows that the shame of the table for one is on the way out.”\nVoice 2  \nMany parts of our world are changing quickly. This affects how people eat, and who they eat with. Many people are moving to new cities. Others have jobs where they travel far from home. People must sometimes eat in restaurants in places where they do not know anyone. The structure of families is also changing. A study published in the health magazine Obesity Research & Clinical Practice looked at this issue. This study, from South Korea, explained how changing family structures influence the way we eat. Time Magazine reported on the study:\nVoice 4  \n“Families in many regions of the world have become smaller in recent decades. There are also more one-person homes. Studies find that ‘at the same time, eating patterns have become irregular, informal, and individualized in the form of more eating alone’.”\nVoice 1  \nThis study also found that eating alone can be bad for people’s bodies. Men who ate at least two meals alone every day, were more likely to have some particular health issues. These issues include higher risk for heart disease and diabetes. Men who ate alone were also more likely to be obese. Eating alone is also connected to emotional health such as feelings of loneliness.\nPhoto by Marcel Heil \nVoice 2  \nBut there can be good things about eating alone too! Sometimes people use this as a time to be thoughtful and thankful about their lives. Or maybe it is just a moment of quiet time to think. If you eat alone, you can also eat whatever you want. This might lead to unhealthy food choices for some people. But it is an opportunity to concentrate on what you need for your own health and happiness. And, if you go out alone, you might meet new people and find a new friendship.\nVoice 1  \nThe Moomin Café in Japan welcomes people dining alone with a stuffed animal. But in other restaurants people can eat alone in a different way. Another restaurant that is especially for people eating alone is in the Netherlands. It is a small pop-up restaurant so it can move to different locations. It is named Eenmaal. This means ‘one meal’ or ‘one time’ in English. At Eenmaal, there are only tables for one. Each meal is perfectly sized for one person. No one is permitted to bring in cell phones or computers. Customers read books. They enjoy fresh food and their own company. Marina van Goor designed Eenmaal. She tells OZY.com about Eenmaal’s social influence:\nVoice 5  \n“We wanted to break the very well-known shame of eating out alone. I noticed that in our society, there is actually no room for being alone in public spaces. We could create a franchise of many more restaurants like this one. I strongly believe it will work anywhere, and there is a need for it.”\nVoice 2\nModern lifestyles and technology can make people very busy all the time. Many people have smartphones with them everywhere they go. People may even go out to eat with others but spend most of the meal on their phones! Layla Khoury-Hanold experimented with eating out every day by herself. She did this for a week. She wrote an article about it for the website Refinery29. She did not let herself use her smartphone while she was eating out. She was worried that people would stare at her. But they did not. Khoury-Hanold writes about what she noticed instead:\nVoice 6  \n“I was getting bored and had to almost sit on my hands. Otherwise I would pull my phone out of my purse and disappear into Instagram. But when I looked around the room, I realized that more than half of the diners were staring at phone screens. They were not staring at me. They were not even looking at the people sitting across from them!”\nPhoto by Chetan Hireholi\nVoice 1  \nThe modern world has changed the way we live and eat. Some people might really be eating “alone” even when they are out with other people! It is not important who people eat with. It is how much they concentrate on what they are experiencing. In this way, a meal alone can be just as good, or even better, than a meal with others.\nVoice 2  \nEating alone can be a lonely experience. But it can also be a wonderful one. Many people even enjoy eating meals alone. Of course, eating is an important part of every culture around the world. But if you cannot eat with friends, you can still enjoy good food and good company – your own!\nVoice 1  \nHow many meals a week do you eat by yourself?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nSam Weiner wanted to have a face full of thick hair. He wanted to grow a beard. He felt it was something he should be able to do. But he never could. So he decided that he would not shave off the hair on his face until he had a beautiful beard. He wrote about this for Vice.com,\nVoice 3  \n“After a few days all I get are a few thin hairs, mostly on my neck. My facial hair is both like wires and sadly thin. I look like a cross between a magic wizard and a sad teenager. I do not like how beards look. But I hate that I cannot grow one!”\nVoice 2  \nMen have been growing hair on their faces for thousands of years. Some men can grow large beards. Some men cannot grow any beard. But beards are more than just hair. They have religious, social, cultural, and even political meaning. Today’s Spotlight is on beards.\nVoice 1\nOn the most basic level, beards can be helpful. If a man works outside, a beard is a way to keep warm in cold weather. But what is the purpose of a beard in warm weather? Or when a man works inside all day? Beards must be more than just a way to keep warm.\nPhoto by Jeremy Perkins\nVoice 2  \nBeards have been popular in different times and places. Beards often become popular because the leader of a country has a beard. In ancient Egypt, men would remove all their hair. Egyptians thought hair made humans more like animals. They would even remove their eye lashes – the small hairs over their eyes! In ancient Greek culture, beards were a sign of power, wisdom, and being a real man. Some Greek men would cut their beard off as a sign of mourning. Or they had to cut it off as a punishment. On the other side of the world, the ruler Genghis Khan had long hair and a beard. This style became popular across what is now China.\nVoice 1  \nGrowing a beard can be a way to connect to the past. It can also be a way to reject the past. If an old leader has a beard, the next leader may not. If the old leader does not have a beard, the next may grow one. Christopher Oldstone-Moore wrote a book about the history of beards. It is called Of Beards and Men. He spoke to Esquire magazine.\nVoice 4  \n“Growing a beard is about reacting to the cultural meaning of facial hair. It is an attempt to define what it means to be a man in a different way than the generations before. There are particular times in history when men have decided to throw off that normal habit of shaving. They began a different way to express being a man.”\nVoice 2  \nBeards are also deeply connected to religion. Around the world, people live their religion in many different ways. But at different times, there have been commands to grow beards in Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Sikhism. Religious commands to grow a beard begin with what it means to be a man. But they often become signs of religious devotion.\nVoice 1\nGrowing a beard can also be a sign of becoming an adult. Men cannot grow beards until they become an adult. Then their bodies produce a chemical called testosterone. This chemical causes the hair on the face to grow. This is why it can be difficult for men who cannot grow a beard. They may feel like they are not a full adult.\nVoice 2  \nHowever, being unable to grow a beard does not make you less of a man. A person can have the necessary chemical testosterone. But the hair on the face does not react. Men who cannot grow a beard usually have normal levels of testosterone. They simply have genes that make it difficult to grow a beard. And yet, many people continue to think that a beard shows that a man is strong, able to have children, and would make a good mate. This leads to the other reason men grow beards. Many men grow beards for women.\nVoice 1  \nIn 2016, the University of Queensland in Australia did a study. They showed thousands of women pictures of men. The men had either no beard, a short beard, or a big beard. Women said that the men with a short beard or no beard were the most sexually good-looking. But the womens’ answers were different when asked who they would marry. Lesley Alderman wrote about the study for the New York Times.\nVoice 5  \n“When it came to choosing a partner, or a man whom a woman could have babies with, the more facial hair the better. Men with full beards were the clear winners on this question. This suggests that men who are ready to marry may do better if they shave less.”\nPhoto by Chermiti Mohamed \nVoice 2  \nScience shows that men who cannot grow beards are still able to have children and be strong. But this study confirms that many people still connect a beard with what it means to be a man. So should all men try to grow a beard? Oldstone-Moore says no. It depends on what you think it means to be a man.\nVoice 4  \n“I think men are thinking about what it is to be a man and how to represent that. And people are more divided than in the past. And what it means to be a man or woman is changing in lots of ways. It makes sense that men would consider a beard as a way to think about being a man. It is a move toward the natural. I think that for a lot of men, that has got to be an important piece of what it means to be a man today – or maybe just a human being. One of the ways to show you have choice is to choose to have a beard.”\nVoice 1  \nWhat do you think of beards? Do they look good? Do you wish you had a beard? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nPeople communicate thoughts and feelings in many different ways. Sometimes a group of people will share one thought or feeling. They can communicate this together.\nListen to a crowd at a football game. \nA symphony concert.\nA political speech.\nVoice 2 \nCan you hear how these crowds communicate? It is applause! Applause is a way to show support. Applause also says ‘thank you.’ And it can show how much a crowd likes something. People applaud for many things. But when did people start to make noise with their hands in this way? And what affects how people applaud? Today’s Spotlight is on the history of applause.\nVoice 1 \nApplause is a form of cheering. A group of people make noise at an event like a music show or a sports game. They sometimes make noise with their mouths. But applause usually includes clapping hands. People hit both of their hands together to make a sharp noise. When many people do this at once it can be very loud!\nPhoto by Nicholas Green\nVoice 2 \nPeople have been clapping for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, theatre shows were very popular. Actors performed a show. Then they would ask the audience for applause. Applause was a way for the crowd to say ‘thank you’ to the performers. But it was also more than this. People could also communicate how much they liked the performance. If they liked it very much they would applaud very loudly and for a long time. But if they did not like it, they would only applaud a little bit. In this way, a crowd could communicate as a group.\nVoice 1 \nApplause also connected people to their leaders. Political leaders in ancient Rome gave long speeches to the people. And people could talk back through applause. Greg Aldrete is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. He studies politicians in ancient Rome. Aldrete told The Atlantic magazine that leaders would listen to the applause of the crowd. They would measure how long and loud it was. From this they would understand if the people supported them.\nVoice 2 \nPoliticians and performers even began to pay people to applaud loudly. They hoped that if the crowd heard people clapping loudly, they would all clap loudly too. In 17th century France, there was a group of people called the ‘claque.’ An actor or politician could pay them money. The claque charged money for different kinds of cheering services. They would clap and shout. The claque would even boo a performance. This showed that they did not like it.\nVoice 1\nApplause developed into a complex system of clapping and other noises. In this way, the crowd did not just watch the theatre or political speeches. They were able to be involved. Greg Aldrete explains some of the different ways a crowd could communicate:\nVoice 3 \n“Their ways of using applause included much more than clapping alone. Crowds made noises like thunder but they also buzzed. They also trilled. Crowds developed ways to express how much they liked the person or persons before them. They used claps, snaps of the finger and thumb and even waved the edges of their clothing.”\nVoice 2 \nIn more modern times people stopped using this kind of complex clapping. It became more important for a crowd to know when to clap. For example, at some kinds of music performances, people should wait to clap until the end. This is good manners. Aldrete says:\nVoice 3\n“Knowing when to stay silent, as well as when to clap, became a mark of education and class. It was a new kind of system for audiences to learn. Applause became a matter of “do” or “don’t,” “all” or “nothing”. It lost much of its old complexity.”\nVoice 1 \nBut people still applaud in many ways. People in different countries also applaud differently. Andrew Litton is a musician. He conducts symphonies, guiding all the musicians to play their instruments together.  He has performed all over the world. He told BBC music magazine:\nVoice 4\n“In the northern countries, if they like you they will launch into rhythmic applause quite soon. And they will keep the rhythmic applause going. But they do not cheer. They do not shout. And in America standing up to applaud is common. People stand immediately and make lots of vocal sounds – lots of shouting ‘Bravo.’ In Germany, you can actually count to three or five slowly after the music stops. Then the applause starts. It is almost like a spiritual feeling. They want to have that spiritual feeling or silence. And then they clap for much longer than anyone else on the planet!”\nVoice 2 \nSome countries even applaud with special kinds of claps or other noises. A writer from China commented online about a special applause used at the Peking Opera:\nVoice 5 \n“Sometimes an actor does an especially good job on a song. Then a few members of the audience will call out “Hao!” in a loud voice. This means “Good!” in Chinese. People will call out one here and one there, faster and faster.”\nVoice 1 \nBut even within a culture there may be differences in how crowds applaud. Jean-Yves Thibaudet is a concert pianist. He thinks that the size of the city affects applause. He told BBC music magazine:\nVoice 6\n“In most of the big capitals people are used to going to a concert. So they will have a similar experience with applause. But sometimes I go to very small places where they do not have so many concerts. Then you hear they have the most incredibly warm and excited response.”\nPhoto by Michael Lee\nVoice 2 \nApplause may depend on the country or size of the crowd. It may come in many forms. But one thing does not change. Artists, sports players and speakers all enjoy hearing applause. It is an important part of their job. Musician Andrew Litton explains:\nVoice 4 \n“An audience’s approval is part of the satisfaction that goes with what we do. People have paid money to attend your concert. And you play this music which hopefully the audience will find joyful and encouraging and spiritually satisfying. So in the end you would like some thanks for it. It is not for the money that we perform. It is really for the sense of sharing this great music. Part of the sharing process is the applause at the end.”\nVoice 1 \nAre there special customs for applause in your home country? Leave your comments on our website at www.radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThe year was 1707. The English ships were in heavy seas. The Weather was bad, and they were lost. The chief of the ships was Admiral Shovell. His officers made an estimate of the ships’ position. But they were wrong. Suddenly, someone shouted ‘Land!’ This call filled the sailors with fear. There should be no land here. They were in the wrong place. Four of the ships crashed into the land. Over 1,600 men died that night. Only 26 survived. It was one of the worst British sea accidents in history. Today’s Spotlight is on one unexpected result of this accident.\nVoice2\nAt the time of the accident, England depended on the shipping industry. Ships brought the people of England sugar, spices, and tea. The people who sailed the ships needed good maps.\nVoice 1\nBut they also needed something more.  They needed to avoid accidents like the loss of Admiral Shovell’s ships. To do this they needed to know exactly where they were. If you look at almost any map, it is divided into small squares by lines.  The lines that go from east to west are the latitude lines. And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars. But they could not measure their east-west position, or longitude, by that method. They needed a good way to measure the ship’s ‘longitude’.\nVoice2\nKing Charles the Second of England knew how important it was to solve this problem.  If the problem was not solved, more ships could be lost. In 1675, King Charles ordered the building of the Royal Observatory. The Observatory was a place where people could study the stars. They could work on the problem of establishing longitude at sea. The King created the Observatory in Greenwich.\nThe first chief of the Observatory was John Flamsteed. Falmsteed worked hard, but he could not solve the longitude problem. And after the loss of Admirals Shovell’s ships, there was even more pressure to find a solution. So in 1714 the British Government offered a prize of GBP 20,0009. The prize would go to the first person who could find a method of measuring longitude at sea. Some people thought that this would never by possible.\nVoice 1\nOur story moves on, to one man – John Harrison. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1693. He was 21 years old when the government offered the prize. Like his father, he was a carpenter. He made things with wood. He did not have much education. But John was very good at making clocks. At that time, all clocks were made from wood. But John made many improvements to the clock design. His clocks did not break, like other clocks. And his clocks were very accurate. Each month they lost or gained no more than one second. They were more accurate than many of the best clocks in London. Three of these clocks still exist. And they are still very accurate!\nVoice2\nHarrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.\nVoice 1\nThe problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.\nVoice2\nIt took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.\nVoice 1\nHarrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.\nVoice2\nHowever, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.\nVoice 1\nHarrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.\nVoice2\nSo in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.\nVoice 1\nThe writers of today’s programme were Shelagh Godwin and Mike Procter.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nA busy city street. Cars and trucks pass quickly. A few people wait to cross. But then, all traffic stops. Suddenly, hundreds of people riding 2-wheeled bicycles fill the street. They are all riding together. After many minutes, the bicycles have all passed by. The traffic starts again. What just happened?\nVoice 2 \nThis was a ‘critical mass.’ A critical mass is any large group of people riding bicycles together for one purpose. In China, the idea of a critical mass started for safety. Bicycle riders would stop at street crossings. They would wait until more bicycle riders stopped too. Soon, a large number of bicycle riders gathered. Then they all crossed the street together. They believed this kept them safe. It is difficult for one bicycle rider to cross a busy street alone. But, it is easy for car drivers to see a large group of bicycle riders.\nVoice 1 \nToday, there are critical mass bicycle rides all over the world. Sometimes they are a kind of protest. But sometimes, they are just to show the importance of bicycles! Bicycles are important for transportation around the world. But how did they become so important? Today’s Spotlight is on the history of the bicycle!\nVoice 2 \nNo one person invented the bicycle. Instead, many people worked together over time. Experts say that the first plans came from Leonardo da Vinci. This famous inventor and artist wrote plans for a modern bicycle hundreds of years ago. But inventors did not create the first working bicycle until the early 1800’s.\nVoice 1 \nThe first bicycle had wheels. But it did not have pedals to move the wheels. The rider pushed the bicycle forward by pushing his feet against the ground. People called these bicycles ‘pushbikes’.\nVoice 2 \nIn the 1850’s and 60’s French inventors changed the design of the bicycle. They made the front wheel larger. And they put pedals on it. Riders used their feet on the pedals to push the bicycle forward. They made this bicycle with a heavy steel frame. And they made the wheels out of wood and iron. People called this bicycle the ‘boneshaker’. On the stone streets of that time, the bicycle shook the rider very hard. It was a painful ride!\nVoice 1\nOver the next ten years, inventors changed the design of the bicycle even more. They made the front wheel even larger. This increased its speed. They also added rubber tires on the wheels. People called this bicycle ‘the ordinary’. But these kinds of bicycles were difficult to ride. They were difficult to push forward. And it was difficult to change directions while riding.\nVoice 2 \nIn 1885, JK Starley invented the first modern bicycle. It looked very similar to the bicycles people ride today. Starley put similar sized wheels on the front and back of the bicycle. He also added a thin metal chain that worked between the pedals and the wheels. The chain let bicycle riders use the back wheel to change directions. He also added a better seat.\nVoice 1 \nStarley’s bicycle design was a large improvement from the old kind of bicycles. But it was still difficult to ride a Starley bicycle. It did not offer a very smooth ride. But in the 1890’s inventors made more improvements to the bicycle. They used better rubber for the wheels. They developed good brakes to stop the bicycle. It was not long before people all around the world used bicycles for sport and play.\nVoice 2 \nPeople also started using bicycles as their main form of transport. Bicycles helped people get from place to place easier. Riding a bicycle is faster than walking. People also say that making bicycles helped scientists and inventors make better machines. In fact, famous inventors like Henry Ford and the Wright Brothers used bicycle technology to create cars and airplanes!\nVoice 1 \nBicycles also had large effects on societies around the world. For example, the bicycle changed life for women in many ways. Before bicycles were invented, in Western countries women usually wore large, close-fitting dresses. But when women started riding bicycles, they started wearing different clothes. They wore trousers like men usually wear. They also stopped wearing such close-fitting shirts or tops. Bicycles also made it possible for women to get around more. Some experts say that bicycles made women feel more independent. They made more women desire and demand freedom and respect.\nVoice 2 \nBicycles also changed the lives of people in cities. They helped reduce crowding in cities. People could live outside the city. Then they could ride bicycles into the city to work. Bicycles also made it easier for men and women to meet and marry. It expanded families because men and women could meet people who lived outside their small towns.\nVoice 1 \nMany things have changed since the first bicycle. More people use cars, buses and trucks for transport now. But inventors have made great improvements to the bicycle. Today’s bicycles are easy to ride. They are much more comfortable. And they can go very fast. Bicycles continue to be a popular form of transportation in many parts of the world. In fact, in many places, bicycles are still the main form of transportation.\nVoice 2 \nThere are many good reasons to ride a bicycle. Bicycles do not damage the environment like cars do. Riding bicycles is good for your health! Also, riding a bicycle costs less money than driving a car. You do not need gas to ride a bicycle. And bicycles cost less money to fix.\nVoice 1 \nImagine what your city would look like if everyone used a bicycle to get around instead of a car or bus. There are some cities in the world that do look like this. Many cities in China and the Netherlands contain more bicycles than cars.\nVoice 2 \nBut in many cities around the world, people do not respect bicycle riders. In fact, in many modern cities, it can be very dangerous to ride a bicycle. Many people die every year in bicycle and car accidents. This is one reason why people ride their bicycles in a critical mass. They want people to recognize bicycle riders. They want people to learn to watch for them on the road. They want people to understand that bicycles are still an important form of transportation today.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Sara DeKoster. The producer was Luke Haley.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nOne hundred years ago. The night was dark. The sea was rough. The waves were high. And the wind was strong. The sailor was worried. He had sailed a long way. And he knew that he was close to land and dangerous rocks. If he sailed too close to the rocks, they would wreck his boat. He could drown.\nVoice 2\nBut then he saw it! He saw something that would keep him and his boat safe. He saw a bright light in the distance. The light was shining on and then off. He stopped worrying. It was a lighthouse. This tall building, a tower with a bright light at its top, would guide him. It warned those at sea to keep away from the rocks around it. With its light, the sailor knew where to sail to keep safe. Lighthouses like this have been guides for sailors for hundreds of years. But what is their future? Today’s Spotlight is on lighthouses.\nVoice 1\nImagine a world without GPS or computers. How would you know where you are in the dark? Sailors depended on lighthouses for many hundreds of years. They were built on the coast, on islands, rocks, and even the sea floor. Lighthouses guided sailors. The lights showed sailors where to sail and where not to sail. But lighthouses also helped sailors to identify where they were. Each lighthouse was different. Each had its own colours and marks. And each lighthouse had its own system or pattern of light flashes. So sailors knew where they were just by looking at the lighthouse both in the day and at night.\nVoice 2\nBefore lighthouses existed, fires on top of hills sometimes guided sailors. Later, people built towers to make the fires more noticeable. The first known lighthouse was the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt. It was built over 2000 years ago. For many centuries, this lighthouse was one of the tallest buildings in the world. It was about 106 meters tall.\nVoice 1\nThat ancient lighthouse no longer exists. But some other ancient lighthouses do. The Tower of Hercules in north-west Spain, is one such lighthouse. It was built by the Romans during the first or second century. This lighthouse is the oldest working lighthouse in the world. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nVoice 2\nExperts say that the age of modern lighthouses began in the 18th century. In this period engineers improved the way that lighthouses were lit. Some lighthouses used coal fires to create the important light. Others still used wood fires. And some used oil lights or even wax candles. But all these forms of light produced smoke. And the smoke made the glass of the lighthouse black and dirty. When the glass was dirty, sailors could not see the light.\nVoice 1\nBut in 1782 a Swiss scientist solved the problem. He invented a method of burning oil that did not produce smoke. Other engineers produced equipment to increase the intensity or power of the light.\nVoice 2\nOver the years, lighthouses used different methods of shining a light out into the sea. But in every case, someone needed to look after the light in the lighthouse. Someone had to light it at night. Someone had to keep the equipment working. So, lighthouse keepers were needed. George Medlicott was a lighthouse keeper in the United Kingdom for 32 years. He told the Independent about his memories of living and working in a lighthouse.\nVoice 3\n‘It was not an easy job. Some of the lighthouses did not have running water, working toilets or heating. Winters were not great. We stayed in small rooms and often spent hours in the dark.’\nVoice 1\nOften a lighthouse keeper had to live away from his family. But sometimes his family stayed with him. Ebonee Gregory had an unusual time as a child. Her father was an assistant lighthouse keeper. She lived with him on a lonely island off the coast of Australia. She told the Guardian about his job and how it affected her.\nVoice 4\n‘My father helped the head lighthouse keeper run and care for the lighthouse and island. They took turns to turn the light on every night and off in the morning. They cleaned the glass. They made weather reports. Our food arrived by air every two weeks along with any letters. If there was bad weather, the food drops would be delayed. I did not have any friends. A picture of my second birthday party shows no one my age, just the two families on the island.’\nVoice 2\nBut times have changed for lighthouses. New technology for lighthouses and navigation has arrived. Soon there may be no lighthouse keepers living in lighthouses. Many countries including Australia, Finland, Ireland, and Japan no longer employ lighthouse keepers.\nVoice 1\nPunta Carena is an important lighthouse on the edge of the island of Capri in Italy. Lighthouse keepers worked there for over 151 years. But now its last lighthouse keeper has left. Carlo D’Oriano was the last lighthouse keeper of Punta Carena. He did not want to leave. He felt that it was important to have a person in a lighthouse in case anything went wrong with the technology. As he prepared to leave his lighthouse home and job he talked with the BBC. He remembered storm waves crashing into his window 25 metres up the lighthouse. He remembered storm winds that made the lighthouse shake.\nVoice5\n‘At first I believed these shakes were small earthquakes or shocks. But over the years I have learned that the anger of the sea is more beautiful than a quiet sea. It makes you remember that nature exists and that this mass of water is open and alive. Only someone who lives alone can understand this. My heart is here. When I can no longer keep the light, I think part of me will turn off too.”\nVoice 2\nWhat do you think is lost when lighthouse keepers have to leave?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of an old man. The man is crouching on the edge of the sun. All around him there is only darkness. There is nothing but this man and an empty world. In his hand, the man holds a tool called a compass. This is a tool people use to create perfect circles on paper. Builders use them to design buildings. Usually, compasses are made of steel. But this compass is made of gold. And the man is not using it on paper. He draws with the compass on the emptiness around him. His long white hair blows in the wind.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called Ancient of Days. It is by the English poet and painter, William Blake. Blake painted it in 1794. The painting shows Blake’s version of the creation of the universe. Here a being like the Christian God designs the world from nothing. \nVoice 1\nLike many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.\nToday’s Spotlight is on William Blake.\nVoice 2\nWilliam Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:\nVoice 3\n“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“\nVoice 2\nWe do not know if Blake really saw these things. We do not know if he only imagined them. We do not know if he saw something he could not explain. But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.\nVoice 1\nBlake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:\nVoice 4\n“I attempted every morning for two weeks to follow your directions. But I found all of my attempts were unsuccessful. So, I decided to show an independence that I know will please you better. I will not follow the path of another, however wonderful that path may be. At any rate, my excuse must be: I could not do anything else. It was out of my power!”\nVoice 2\nDoctor Trussler was not happy with Blake’s new direction. He told Blake the images were not realistic. Trussler refused to have Blake work for him again.\nVoice 1\nBut though Blake was not wealthy, he continued to make his own art. He created his own way of engraving on copper. And, he began writing poetry. Blake created many books of poetry. And, he would make images to go along with his poems. Some of these books were about the future as Blake imagined it.\nVoice 2\nBut he also wrote poems about love and wonder. One of Blake’s best known poems is called The Tyger. It is from his book Songs of Innocence and Experience. Nick Page reads part of Blake’s poem.\nVoice 5\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\nVoice 1\nBlake’s poem speaks about the creation of a tiger. He compares the process to making steel or iron. This process, called forging, is dangerous. It needs a lot of heat and strength. Blake wonders who could create such a powerful thing. He asks who would have that kind of strength.\nVoice 2\nBlake died in 1827. At that time, few people knew who he was. But soon Blake’s work gained wider recognition. People saw his paintings as strange when he was alive. But today we recognize that these works are one of a kind. Blake’s paintings are powerful markers of faith and creativity. His poems also influenced many writers.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake did not seem to care about popularity. He believed in his art. And he believed in the things he saw. He felt it was important to express what he believed. And he worked toward doing this with everything he had.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nSmall, shiny shells. Round metal coins. Colorful paper. Square pieces of plastic. What do these things have in common? They are all different kinds of money!\nVoice 2 \nHow do you get the things you need? Do you trade with a friend? Do you use paper money, or coins? Or do you use credit? Throughout history, people have used all of these different kinds of money. Today’s Spotlight is on the history of money.\nVoice 1 \nTrading is one of the first ways that people have gotten what they need. For example, in the past, salt was very important to people. People needed salt to keep food fresh. So people would trade salt for other things they needed. People traded salt for shoes, tools, weapons, and food. This method of trading is called bartering. Instead of buying things, people bartered, or traded, for them.\n1769 Drawing of A Maori bartering a crayfish with an English naval officer.; British Library, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nBut bartering does not always work well. For example, a man who makes shoes may need some rice. He may try to trade the shoes he makes for the rice. But the person who grows rice may not need new shoes. If the man who grows rice is not willing to trade, the man who makes shoes is not able to get what he needs.\nVoice 1 \nSo over time, people developed a new system. Instead of bartering, people would trade for particular objects. These objects were often rare or beautiful. But sometimes the objects were even common things.\nVoice 2 \nThese special objects are called proto-money. Proto means “first in time” or “earliest.” So, proto-money is the first, or earliest kind of money. Some cultures used objects such as seeds, pieces of wood, animal skins, cloth, and shells.\nVoice 1 \nIn Native American culture, people used pieces of a special kind of seashell as money. This kind of money was called wampum. People wore the pieces of wampum around their necks. It was a popular form of proto-money. In the 1600s, local governments in the United States even accepted it as an official form of money! People used wampum in America until about the year 1700.\nVoice 2 \nAnother popular kind of proto-money was a shell from the coasts of the Indian Ocean. This shell is called a cowrie shell. People have used cowrie shells in many places – from China to Africa. People used the cowrie shell because it is very beautiful. The shell is white with a little bit of yellow. The surface is very smooth. It is between one and three centimeters long. The small size and the physical beauty made the cowry shell a very popular kind of proto-money. In some parts of the world, people used cowrie shells as money until the 1800s.\nVoice 1 \nHowever, the most popular kind of proto-money was metal. The ancient Egyptians weighed amounts of metal like gold or silver. Each amount had a particular value. The Egyptians used gold and silver because of their beauty. These metals were purer than other metals, like iron. People bought things for different amounts of metal. Something very valuable was worth a larger amount and weight of metal. Using metal as money led people to create metal coins.\nVoice 2 \nPeople in ancient Turkey made the first metal coins. The coins first appeared almost 3000 years ago. People used special tools to create pictures on pieces of metal. Each picture identified how much the piece of metal weighed. Each different weight of metal was worth a different amount.\nVoice 1 \nCoins spread from Turkey into Africa and Europe. Soon, coins became the most popular form of money. People began to use coins all over the world. Coins had many different kinds of pictures stamped into them. Some coins had animals, while others showed common things such as tools or plants. Each different picture represented a different amount.\nVery old Chinese coin; Scott Semans World Coins (CoinCoin.com), CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nThe first person to have his face on a coin was Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great lived more than 2000 years ago. He was the king of an area in Macedonia near Greece. He fought many battles, and never lost. He is one of history’s greatest military commanders. His coins were used throughout his territory.\nVoice 1 \nAnother popular face on a coin was the face of Maria Theresa. She was the queen of Austria in 1765. Her coin was so popular that people used it in countries outside of Austria. People in Arabia and Africa began to use the Maria Theresa coins as money. Some people even believed that the Maria Theresa coins had magical powers. People used these coins in parts of Africa until 1924!\nVoice 2 \nEven though coins were so popular, it was not easy to carry a lot of coins a far distance. They were too heavy. The Chinese were the first to use paper money instead. They started using paper money more than 1000 years ago. This new paper money was easier to carry for long distances.\nVoice 1 \nHundreds of years later, Europe also began to use paper money. In the beginning, people wrote paper money by hand. But as time went on, governments took over the job of making money. If paper money became damaged or too dirty, a person could trade in their old money for new money. If they needed to, they could also trade in the paper for its value in gold or silver.\nVoice 2 \nMoney has continued to change, even in recent times. In some places, people rarely use money. Instead, they use thin plastic credit cards. Using a credit card, a person borrows money from a bank, when he buys something. Then, at the end of the month, he pays the bank. This makes it easy to spend money! Money experts say that it is too easy. When people use paper money or coins, they spend less money. When they use a credit card, people spend more money – even too much money. This leads to debt – the person owes money to the bank.\nVoice 1 \nWhat will money look like in the future? Experts think that soon everything will happen electronically – using computers. This digital money will replace physical money. This is already happening. But in most places, people still use beautiful, colorful paper money and shiny metal coins.\nVoice 2 \nPeople from long ago may have never imagined all the different and new ways that people can pay for things today. We have come a long way since the days of bartering. What kind of money do you use?\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Joshua Leo. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nOn two days every year, most places on earth experience 12 hours of light, and 12 hours of darkness. These two days are the Spring Equinox and the Fall Equinox.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nOn these two days something special happens in the ancient city of Chichen Itza. The sun shines on one of the large and ancient stone structures built here. On this particular structure, it appears as if a snake made of light is moving slowly down the wall.\nVoice 1 \nThis special effect depends on exact measuring of the sun’s position. Experts think that ancient people called the Maya built this structure, and the city, many years ago. Experts say that the Maya’s knowledge of the sun’s position is unusual.\nVoice 2\nToday’s Spotlight is on the ancient city of Chichen Itza. This city is in southern Mexico. Thousands of years ago Chichen Itza was full of people. It was one of the most powerful cities of one of the most powerful ancient cultures – the Maya. But today, no one lives there. It is only a group of old buildings. However, people from around the world still come to see it. People come to learn about its ancient culture, the culture of the Maya people.\nThe ruins of Chichen Itza; Image by Vincent Godfroy from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe Mayan culture began almost 3,000 years ago. It grew in parts of Central America. Today we know this area as the countries of Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.\nVoice 2 \nThe Maya were skilled in many areas. Experts believe the Maya were excellent farmers. They also believe that the Maya created a complex written language. This may have been the first written language to come from the Americas. The Maya were also very good at mathematics. Their number system included the number “zero.” Mathematics experts say that using the number zero was an amazing thing. Other ancient cultures of the time did not use this number.\nVoice 1 \nHowever, people may know the Maya best for their calendar. A calendar separates time into different lengths, like months, days and minutes. Making a very exact calendar is extremely difficult. But the Maya used their knowledge of mathematics and their interest in the stars to build a calendar. They carefully observed the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. This knowledge helped them to create their calendar.\nVoice 2 \nOther cultures also influenced and helped build parts of Chichen Itza. After a few hundred years, the Maya had left their city. They did return later. But then about 1,000 years ago a group called the Toltecs invaded the Maya. They did not conquer the Maya. Instead, the two cultures lived together. They even began to combine parts of their religious ceremonies. The Toltecs ruled the city for about 300 years. But they left the city. No one knows why.\nVoice 1 \nA little later, the Itza invaded the city.  The Itza were invaders from a different area. The Itza built new parts of the city. And they gave the city its name. The name “Chichen Itza” means “mouth of the well of the Itza”. However, the Itza did not rule the city very long. They left Chichen Itza after about 25 years. Again, no one knows why the Itza left.\nVoice 2 \nExperts know that the Toltecs and Itza built some of the buildings in the city of Chichen Itza. They used many images of their god in their building designs. The Toltecs and Itza worshipped the same god. Their god looked like a snake, but with feathers like a bird. In the beginning of this program we told you about a snake of light that climbs the wall of an ancient building. The snake of light is an image of this god.\nCarvings at Chichen Itza;; Image by DEZALB from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThis interesting structure in Chichen Itza is the Pyramid of Kukulcan. A pyramid has four sides. These sides all come together at one point at the top. Each side on the Pyramid of Kukulcan has 91 steps. And there is one more step at the top of the pyramid. In all, there are 365 steps on the pyramid. This is the same as the number of days in a year. Some experts believe the Maya could have used this building to help them know when to plant crops. Each day the sun falls on a different step of the pyramid. This could be a way to follow the year.\nVoice 2 \nThe people of Chichen Itza especially designed one building to observe and study the movement of the stars and planets. This building is the observatory. Experts say that the observatory is one of the most complex structures the Maya built. A set of steps went up and around and around the observatory tower. The steps made the observatory tower look like a large shell – like a snail’s shell. The top of the observatory tower was a dome, that is, it was shaped like a half circle. And there were windows in the tower. Each window had a purpose. Experts believe that a person looking through one of these windows could see particular stars on particular dates. The Maya may have believed that studying the stars could tell them the future.\nBut Chichen Itza was not only ancient buildings and studying stars. The citizens of Chichen Itza also had their own very popular ball games! Chichen Itza had the largest game area, or court, in Central America. The Maya probably played a game that was a little like football. Pictures of past games cover the walls of the ball court. But these pictures also show some violent events in these games. One picture even shows an official cutting off a man’s head in the centre of the game court.\nVoice 1 \nAround the year 1300, the Itza people left the city. Experts do not know why they left. Some Maya people still lived there. In 1517 Spanish invaders tried to invade the area around Chichen Itza. The Maya resisted for a time. But they could not resist the Spanish for long. The Spanish finally defeated the Maya. Sadly, Spanish invaders later destroyed many historical documents. So, we may never know the full history of Chichen Itza.\nVisitors at the pyramid of Kukulcan;; Image by VViktor from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nToday, people from all over the world visit the ancient ruins of Chichen Itza. The Secretary of Tourism in Mexico says that over a million tourists visit Chichen Itza every year. Large crowds gather at the Pyramid of Kukulcan to watch the snake of light climb. They see the carefully designed buildings. But today, the ruins will not be destroyed. Chichen Itza is a UNESCO World Heritage site, an important part of the world’s history.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer and producer of this program was Liz Waid.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on Youtube\nVoice 1 \nA young woman sits at a table at home. She cuts some cotton cloth. Then she uses her sewing machine to make something special. It is something that will protect both her and other people. She is making a face mask to cover her mouth and nose.\nVoice 2 \nPeople around the world cover their mouths and noses for health reasons. Doctors wear face masks when they operate. Many people wear masks to protect them from poor air quality. But in 2020, many more people around the world started to wear masks. They did this to protect each other from the COVID-19 virus. Today’s Spotlight is on wearing masks. We look at the long history of wearing masks for health reasons.\nVoice 1 \nEarly records show that some individuals wore masks for health reasons hundreds of years ago. Leonardo da Vinci was a famous artist of the 15th century. He used paint that contained poisonous chemicals. He covered his face with a wet cloth to protect his lungs from those poisons.\nVoice 2 \nPeople also wore masks in the 17th century. At that time, a deadly sickness or plague came to Europe. People did not understand how disease was spread. But some doctors wore strange masks over their faces. The masks were shaped like the head of a bird. The long pointed beak contained herbs. These sweet-smelling plants were designed to protect the doctor from the smell of the disease and dead bodies.\nA Plague doctor mask; Image by Enrique Meseguer from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nIn the 19th century, doctors and scientists worked to understand how disease spread between people. They began to understand that the human breathing system could carry and spread germs and disease.\nVoice 2 \nBased on this new knowledge, scientists suggested something new to surgeons or doctors who operated on patients. They suggested surgeons should cover their nose and mouth with thin material called gauze. When a person breathes out, he can expel bacteria. But the gauze would stop this bacteria. It would protect any wound from being infected by it. By the 1920s, all surgeons wore masks to operate.\nVoice 1 \nBy then, masks were also used as a treatment to prevent disease. In 1910, in Manchuria China a serious plague broke out. Wu Lien-teh from Malaya worked there. He developed a mask made from gauze and cotton that was tied behind the ears. These masks saved the lives of many doctors. The general population also used the masks to avoid getting the disease. A few years later this method of disease prevention had to be used again. That time, people in more than one country had to use it.\nVoice 2 \nIn 1918, World War I ended. In that same year a terrible disease spread around the world. This global disease was a deadly flu virus. Over a period of two years, it infected almost one third of the world’s population. Experts estimate that over 50 million people died from the virus. Many governments required everyone to wear masks on public transport and at work. Some people did not want to do this. In San Francisco USA, the government told people, ‘Wear A Mask and Save Your Life.’ Health experts said wearing a mask did not just protect them. It helped to protect others around them.\nA policeman warns a man to get a flu mask, 1918; California State Library\nVoice 1 \nIn the middle of the 20th century, people started to wear masks for another health reason. In some countries, industry and high levels of traffic led to poor air quality. In many parts of Asia, people wear masks to protect them from polluted air. For example, in the Philippines and Vietnam, motorcycle riders wear masks in heavy traffic.\nVoice 2 \nIn many countries in Asia people consider it normal to wear a mask when out in public. In 2017, Kei from Asian Boss spoke to young Japanese people about why they wear masks:\nVoice 3 \n‘It is considered good behaviour. You are not spreading your germs or bacteria around.’\nVoice 4 \n‘I put it on because the air smells bad.’\nVoice 2 \nOther Japanese people wear masks for reasons not connected with health. Some people use masks as a social barrier. One young man told Kei,\nVoice 5 \n‘I put my mask on because I feel people will not notice me so much. That makes me feel less worried.’\nImage by djedj from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nSo many people in Asia wore masks that designers of clothes started to make masks to match clothes. Famous designers used international fashion events to show their masks. In 2015, Chinese designer Masha Ma included face masks covered with jewels at a fashion show.\nVoice 2 \nBut in other parts of the world people did not normally wear masks. Some of the young people Kei spoke to were shocked to discover that people in the West did not wear a mask even if sick.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2020, the attitude of people in the West changed. A deadly new virus called COVID-19, or coronavirus, spread around the world. The World Health Organisation advised people how to deal with coronavirus. This included information about the need to wear masks. If people could not keep a physical distance from each other they had to wear masks in public places. The organisation explained that masks can prevent someone else from being infected.\nVoice 2 \nPeople all over the world started to wear masks to protect each other. Some countries made it the law that people had to wear a mask in public. But not everyone owned a mask and sometimes masks were difficult to buy. Some governments told people to make their own masks.\nVoice 1 \nSpotlight’s Liz Waid is one person who made masks. She lives in the USA where it was not common to wear a mask before coronavirus. As coronavirus spread around the world, Liz started to make masks. She made over 500 cloth masks for family, friends, and local schools and organisations. Every weekend, and many nights after work, she sat at home and sewed and made masks. Liz explains how she felt about making masks.\nLiz Waid, sewing masks at home\nLiz Waid\n‘I know that homemade masks are not a perfect solution to fighting coronavirus. But they can make a difference if everyone wears them. It makes me feel good to know that I am part of the solution. I am helping people in this simple way.’\nVoice 2 \nDo you wear a face mask?

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Bruce Gulland.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\n\nRead along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nIt was 1191. Duke Leopold the fifth, of Austria, was in a battle. After the battle he took his cloth coat off. It was covered in blood from the battle. But there was one stripe of white on his coat. It was white underneath the belt he was wearing around his waist. He liked the design. So, he made this design into a flag. It was red with a white stripe in the middle. It became the official design of the Austrian flag in the year 1919. And it is still Austria’s flag today.\nVoice 2  \nNot every flag has such an exciting story in its history. But flags often do tell their own stories. They show meaning and inspire people. Today’s Spotlight is on flags.\nVoice 1  \nPeople who study history believe that the first people to use flags lived in ancient Egypt. Egyptians made the first flags by tying long pieces of cloth to the end of very long poles. They carried these long poles when they fought in battles. They believed that their flags would please their gods and help them win the battles.\nVoice 2  \nThe flags were also very useful. One soldier had the special job of carrying the flag. Generals watched the flag to know where their soldiers were. Flags also showed which way the wind was blowing. This helped soldiers aim their arrows.\nVoice 1  \nBut flags had an even more important purpose in battle. Flags were a sign of the people. A flag showed other people who was fighting in a battle. Each group fighting in a battle carried a different colour flag.\nListen to the Advanced version of this program\nVoice 2  \nAfter a time, other cultures also began to use flags. And they added more than just colour. Flag designers started to put important pictures on the flags. These pictures, or symbols, on the flags represented ideas, people, or gods. Kings put their symbols on flags. When a king sent his people to battle, his enemies could see his symbol. They knew which king was attacking.\nVoice 1  \nMost flags use a common set of symbols. People have used these symbols for a very long time. For example, when you see a star on a flag, it usually represents unity. The number of stars on a flag may tell how many parts of something are united in some way. Other flags use symbols from nature, like leaves, trees, or animals. Some flags use religious symbols like crosses. Many Christian groups use a cross on their flags. Most flags are shaped like rectangles, or long squares. But some are square, like the flag of Switzerland.\nSwiss flag, Image by Erich Westendarp from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nAnd flags are not just for countries! Groups like the United Nations, the Red Cross, and the European Union all have flags. Countries, states, cities, and even some small people groups have flags. But why are all these different flags needed?\nVoice 1  \nFlags are very good at communicating messages. But flags do not communicate with language. They do not need words to send a message. Instead, flags communicate with colors, symbols, and design. A person can read the message of a flag just by looking at it. Each flag’s colour, symbols and design represent the people, government, land or ideas in a country or group. Think about your flag. You probably know what the colors and symbols on your flag mean. Here are a few examples of how flags use symbols and colour to send their messages.\nVoice 2  \nThe symbol on the Lebanese flag is a Cedar tree. The cedar tree is a very popular tree in Lebanon. The flag tells other people that this is an important tree in Lebanon.\nVoice 1  \nFlags also represent values and ideas by using colour. The flag of Libya is only one colour. It is green. But this colour represents an important idea for the people of Libya. Green is a traditional colour of Islam. Islam is Libya’s national religion. The green flag tells people who do not live in Libya that many people in Libya practice Islam.\nVoice 2  \nFlags may also use similar colors or designs to show unity with other nations around them. Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica all use the colors blue and white in their flags. Before 1838, these countries were joined together as the United Provinces of Central America. When they separated, each country chose a new flag design. But each new flag design was a version of the old design. These five separate South American flags all have a white stripe between two blue stripes. The white stripe represents land. And the blue stripes represent two oceans. But each flag has different symbols on it. So, the flags look similar, but they are all very different.\nCentral American flags, Image by Kjrstie from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nFlags can also represent a group of countries that share a common goal or interest. Imagine the flag of the Olympic Games. The Olympic flag is white. It has no borders. In the middle there are five circles. They are blue, black, red, yellow, and green. The circles are linked together. There are five continents that take part in the Olympic Games. And each circle represents a continent. When people see the Olympic flag they see the message of the Olympics. They see that every continent is equal. And they see that the Olympic Games encourage unity.\nVoice 2  \nFlags can also tell a part of the history of a country or group. An example of this is the story about Austria’s flag from the beginning of this program.\nVoice 1  \nOn a flag, colour, symbol, and design combine to make something very meaningful. Flags are often a symbol for a country. When a person is proud of their country, their leader, or their group, they are happy to show people their flag. Flags unite people across a country, and sometimes around the world. Flags are a message that people can stand behind. Sometimes people will even die to protect and preserve a flag that sends a message they believe in.\nVoice 2  \nIt is good for people to think about what they stand for and believe in. A flag is a very powerful thing. What does your flag represent? Do you think it is a good description of your country? What is your favorite flag? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nImagine a large white horse. It has a long, pointed horn coming out of the middle of its head. It is gentle, but powerful. This creature seems to be surrounded by magic. It is full of majesty, grace, and beauty. It seems to shine with a silver-colored light. You probably already know what this imaginary creature is called. This is a unicorn.\n\nFollow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2  \nUnicorns are the magical one-horned creatures from myths and stories. People often imagine unicorns that look like the description above. Unicorns are imaginary. But they may be based on a true animal. Today’s Spotlight is on unicorns.\nVoice 1  \nAll over the world, people of all ages love to tell stories about unicorns. Unicorns have even inspired modern clothing fashion and art. But the unicorn has also become a very serious symbol. It represents hope and brightness to many people. Alice Fisher is a reporter for the Guardian Newspaper. She writes that people want to be open to new ideas. They want to believe in the possibility of a magic creature. She says that it is even more important in our modern times. She writes:\nVoice 3  \n“Every era we use myths and stories to help make sense of the world. In recent times people have used aliens, zombies and vampires. But in our uncertain times, we have chosen the unicorn – a symbol of hope and purity and strangeness.”\nImage by Anja from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nThe unicorn is a modern symbol. But this creature’s story is very old. And it is not just one story. There is no single version of the unicorn. In the Middle Ages, European people believed unicorns were real. For them, the unicorn was a holy creature with great intelligence. It could heal wounds with a touch of its horn. But the unicorn was very difficult to catch. Only a pure person could see a unicorn for more than a moment.\nVoice 1  \nThere are stories of unicorns that come from before the Middle Ages. In fact, there is a version of the unicorn in most cultures. Pliny the Elder was a writer from ancient Greece. He wrote some of the first books on natural history. In one of them, he describes a creature called the monoceros. It was a one-horned creature that lived in modern-day India.\nVoice 2  \nThe monoceros had the body of a horse, the head of a stag, the feet of an elephant, and the tail of a wild pig. It had one black horn that grew out of the middle of its forehead. Pliny the elder said that people there hunted the monoceros – but they could never capture it. This animal was not real. But some people think the story of the monoceros inspired unicorn stories.\nVoice 1  \nThe ancient Chinese told of a creature similar to the unicorn. It was called the Qilin. Some writers say it had scales like a snake. But it walked on four legs. It had hooves, like a horse. And it had a single horn growing from its head. The Qilin was very important in Chinese culture. It was very rare, so the people believed that the Qilin was lucky. It only appeared when a great king or holy person was born. Like the Unicorn, it was a very powerful magic animal. The stories are so similar that some western people call the Qilin a “Chinese unicorn.”\nVoice 2  \nBut scientists have found evidence of a real creature with one horn. It was called the Elasmotherium. Elasmotherium was a huge creature that lived thousands of years ago. Scientists found its bones in modern-day Russia. Elasmotherium had long hair over its whole body. And it had a horn on its head the size of a person. It was a very powerful animal. People may have hunted them for food or their skin or horn.\nElasmotherium – By ДиБгд – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=69413019\nVoice 1  \nThere are many other creatures like unicorns in stories from around the world. These stories are all similar. Some people believe that the unicorn may once have been a real animal, like Elasmotherium. People may have told stories about this real animal. Then, over time, the stories changed. People described the creature in more and more amazing ways. Over time, the unicorn creature of the story became different from the real animal.\nVoice 2  \nThese stories had another purpose. Storytellers used them to teach lessons. And they shaped the animal to fit those teachings. Most people had never seen an animal like a unicorn. But it became part of a tradition. In this way, people did not forget the special power of these animals. Their power simply changed.\nVoice 1  \nIn the modern world, most people do not believe they will ever see a creature like a unicorn. People are moving more and more to a scientific view of the world. But stories and myths are still valuable!\nVoice 2  \nJoel Dubois is a professor at the University of California at Sacramento. He teaches mythic storytelling. He says that many people think the word myth means stories are false. But he says science cannot tell us everything. On the university website Dubois writes how life is more than just science – the things we can see:\nVoice 4  \n“People who share myths usually believe that reality is too complex to understand in one way. So they often use stories to show that complexity. For storytellers, stories about mythic worlds are more real in some ways than stories of facts we can observe with our own eyes. These storytellers know myths are about people in other worlds, living a special story. But they also point out hidden connections between myths and the normal people, places, things and events that people experience every day.”\nImage by Vane from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nMyths and stories are more about people than the creature that they talk about. Myths help us understand important times in our lives. They take us through difficult journeys. Myths can connect to people of any culture, in any time and place. The myth of the unicorn is one myth that will likely continue. It is a beautiful story in a troubling world.\nVoice 2  \nDo you have any myths in your family or community? What do they mean to you?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Christy VanArragon\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nEvery day more people in the world use computers and other technology to communicate. Many books are now available on the internet. People write emails, and text messages, instead of letters. In many places, people do not even use physical money to pay for things any more. All these technologies are replacing one of the most important materials in history: paper. Today’s Spotlight is on paper, its history and its importance in the world today.\nVoice 2\nMany people believe that paper started with the ancient Egyptians. However, this is not exactly true. Instead, 5000 years ago, Egyptians used a material called papyrus. They made papyrus from the stems of river plants. They put these flat pieces together, to create a larger flat sheet. Ancient Egyptians wrote on these sheets like paper.\nVoice 1\nBut the paper we know today did not exist until 3000 years later. It was created in China. Before the invention of paper, people in China would write on pieces of bone, bamboo or costly cloth. No one knows who first invented paper. But history does tell us about one man who improved the process. It was in the year 105. A man named Cai Lun began to experiment. He used many materials to make paper. He took bark from the outside of trees, pieces of net normally used to catch fish, and pieces of cloth rags. He broke these materials down into very small pieces. He put all these materials into a large container of water, to mix them. Then he removed this material, using a screen. When he pressed out the water, all that was left was a thin sheet of paper. He presented this new way of making paper to the Emperor. The Emperor was very happy and gave Cai Lun much money.\nVoice 2\nPaper quickly spread to other areas of the world. In the Middle East, people made paper thicker. They also made it easier to produce quickly. From the Middle East, paper travelled to Europe and then the Americas. For many years paper cost a lot of money and time to create. But in the 19th century, people began to use steam powered machines to create paper from wood. Paper is still made from wood today in large factories around the world.\nVoice 1\nPaper changed the way people lived. Long ago, when paper was difficult to make, people only used paper for special purposes. Religious leaders would write holy words on it. Government officials would write important laws on it. Explorers drew maps of the world on it. But normal, common people did not use it. As paper became easier to make, it was used for more things. People wrapped it around gifts. Anyone could use paper to make notes and write down information. Paper was also used as money.\nVoice 2\nToday people use paper for even more things. Paper cloths clean up dirt. Many products are sold in cardboard boxes made from paper. People drink water and other drinks out of paper cups.\nPhoto by Jon Tyson\nVoice 1\nBut this creates a new problem – the problem of waste. When we are done using paper, it does not just disappear. Some paper can be recycled – it can be made into new paper. But a lot of paper simply becomes waste, or garbage. It is burned for energy, or stored in large landfills. Paper does biodegrade, or break down over time but it does not happen quickly. As the paper breaks down it releases harmful gasses into the air. In the United States, paper makes up one third of all waste. In just that country, that is 85 million tons per year!\nVoice 2\nBut this is not the only problem that paper can cause. In the past, paper included materials from cloth, waste paper, and other fibres from plants. But today, most paper comes from trees. Many of these trees come from very old forests around the world. Today, only 20 percent of the world’s ancient forests still exist. Around the world, every two seconds, people cut down more than 4,000 square meters of trees. And many of those trees became paper.\nPhoto by Lukasz Szmigiel\nVoice 1\nThese ancient forests cannot be replaced. Forests provide oxygen for animals and humans. They store the gas carbon dioxide, which can cause global warming. Cutting down trees can also destroy environmental systems. The birds, plants and animals that live there may also die. Some companies plant new trees when they cut down forests. But it takes a long time for new trees to grow. Often, these newly planted trees are all the same kind of tree. This is called a monoculture. A monoculture forest can get diseases easier. If one tree gets sick, all the same kind of trees get sick. When forests have many different kind of trees, they can resist disease easier.\nVoice 2\nCreating the paper can also cause environmental problems. Large paper factories use chemicals to make paper white. They also use a lot of water to create the paper. The chemicals pollute the water. If the factories release the water without removing the chemicals, the water can then pollute rivers and lakes. The chemicals in the water can also cause health problems.\nVoice 1\nSo what can be done to help reduce the number of trees being cut down for paper? What can a person do to change their paper impact on the world?\nVoice 2\nThe first step is to try to use less paper. Could you clean with a cloth instead of paper? Can you use less paper in your office or home? Can you re-use the paper used to cover a gift?\nVoice 1\nNext, look at the kind of paper you use. Most paper can be reused in some way. Old paper can be turned into new paper through recycling. By recycling paper like this, less trees have to be cut down. It takes less energy to recycle paper than it does to make new paper from trees. Are there ways to recycle paper where you live?\nVoice 2\nMany companies make products from post-consumer materials. This means that instead of cutting down trees to make the paper products, they use recycled paper. Buying these recycled paper products can save a lot of trees, water and energy.\nVoice 1\nIn many places, people can also buy paper that comes from forests that are sustainably harvested. This means that when the trees in these forests are cut down, people make sure that it will not damage the environment of the forest.\nVoice 2\nPaper has been an important part of history. It has made many things possible. And even though people are using less paper, it is still very important to us today. But it is up to us to make sure that paper does not harm the world. It is our responsibility to give it a positive future.\nVoice 1\nThe writer and producer of this program was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nMore than five centuries ago, two armies fought a great battle. The battle ended years of civil war in England. On one side of the battle field was the army of King Richard III. On the other side was the army of Henry Tudor. Henry wanted to become king.\nVoice 2 \nDuring the battle, King Richard saw a chance to kill Henry. Richard rode his horse quickly toward Henry.  He killed many of Henry’s soldiers. But then, King Richard’s horse became stuck in the wet battlefield. The king fell. He fought hard, but there were too many enemy soldiers around him. The soldiers crushed Richard’s head and killed him. Later, they carried his dead body through the streets for all the people to see.\nVoice 1 \nReligious leaders finally buried Richard’s body in a nearby church. But years later the church was destroyed. And Richard’s body was forgotten. Today’s Spotlight is on the recent discovery of Richard III’s body. This news about his death has caused many people to look again at his life.\nVoice 2 \nRichard III was the last king of England to die in battle. His body did not receive honour. He was not buried in Westminster Abbey, the great Christian church in London where many English kings are buried. He was also not buried where he wanted to be. Richard wanted to be buried at his family home near the ancient city of York. Instead King Richard was buried in the city of Leicester, near the battle field where he died. And there he lay, forgotten.\nVoice 1 \nHundreds of years went by. The church building had been destroyed long ago. The city around Richard’s body had changed. No one knew where his bones were. Then, in 2012, a team of experts began a new search.  These archaeologists were looking for the body of King Richard. But they were not looking in a place that would honour a king. The team was digging under a car park, a place where people leave their cars.\nVoice 2 \nSoon, the team found human bones. Immediately, they thought it was King Richard. They thought this because the skeleton’s spine was unusual.  This bone in the middle of a human’s back is usually straight. However, the spine they found was bent or crooked. And history books had long told of how King Richard’s spine was crooked.\nVoice 1 \nThe archaeologists wanted to be sure it was King Richard. So, they performed many tests on the skeleton. Many things proved that the bones were Richard III’s, including DNA tests.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, many people believed it was Richard just because of the reports about the crooked spine. For hundreds of years, people had remembered Richard for this. Artists painted pictures of Richard with one of his shoulders higher than the other. And writers told stories of ‘crooked’ Richard. However, crooked has another meaning too. For example, people say that criminals are crooked. This means that their character is not straight and honest.\nVoice 1 \nMany people say that Richard III was a crooked king – both in the way he looked and in his character. This is how England’s greatest writer, William Shakespeare, described King Richard. Over 400 years ago, Shakespeare wrote a famous play about Richard III. At this time, many people believed that a disability was a sign of evil. So Shakespeare made Richard even more disabled in his play. His character did not just have a crooked back. He also had an arm that did not work. In the play, Richard also murdered his brother. And he made secret plans to steal power.\nVoice 2 \nShakespeare’s play is not historically true. However, his work has shaped many people’s opinions of King Richard III. Shakespeare wrote his drama when the granddaughter of Henry Tudor ruled England. And here is the problem. Most of our information about Richard III comes from people who supported Henry Tudor and his family.\nVoice 1 \nThere is another famous story about Richard’s crooked character. This is not a story from literature. It is a mysterious story from history. But no one knows the full truth. It is the story of ‘The Princes in the Tower.\nVoice 2 \nRichard’s older brother, Edward, had been king before him. He died, but his two sons were too young to rule the country. So Richard took his brother’s place. He was supposed to protect the young boys from their enemies. He was supposed to take care of the country, until his oldest nephew could rule.\nVoice 1 \nBut the boy princes disappeared. They were never seen again. Richard became king instead. Followers of Henry Tudor said Richard killed his brother’s sons. Others believe that Richard cared for the boys, but that Henry had them killed when he became king. However, what exactly happened is still a mystery today.\nVoice 2 \nWe do know some facts about Richard. Richard lived in a dangerous time. Powerful men spent much time plotting against each other. And he did have many of his strongest enemies killed.\nVoice 1 \nBut other facts do not match the stories about Richard’s crooked character. While his brother Edward was king, Richard was loyal to him. As a soldier, he fought for Edward in many battles. Richard also had a loving relationship with his wife and his own son.\nVoice 2 \nWe also know that his people loved Richard. He gave money to universities and churches. He did many things to help the poor. This does not seem like the kind of person who would murder his brother’s children!\nVoice 1 \nWe may never know the truth about Richard III. The history of his life seems to be crooked too! However, like all people, Richard was probably a mix of good and evil. This is exactly what Philippa Langley believes. Langley is a film writer. She has long believed that Richard was not as evil as many people think. She is part of an organization that defends Richard’s character. And she was one of the people responsible for finding Richard’s body. Langley hopes the discovery will create discussion about his life. Langley told the New York Times newspaper,\nVoice 3 \n“The truth will turn out to be somewhere in between. Richard III was a man of his time. But what we know of him does not equal him being a vicious man and a purely evil killer. Now, we may be able to finally discover who the real Richard is.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Alan Harris. The producer was Nick Mangeolles.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever agreed to meet a friend for a meal? Imagine this. You arrived early and got a good table. You waited. And waited. Now she is almost 30 minutes late. You begin to worry. What if something happened? What if she is hurt and needs help? You send her a message asking if everything is ok. She says that everything is fine. You ask if she is going to be there soon. She messages back, “I forgot!”\nVoice 2  \nYou sit there for a minute. You do not feel good about what happened. But what can you say? Anyone can forget a meeting. What really makes you angry is that your friend did not say “I am sorry.” Today’s Spotlight is on when, why, and how people say, “I am sorry.”\nVoice 1  \nPeople apologize in many different ways and for different reasons. Some people say “sorry” more often than other people. And saying sorry is also cultural. People in some cultures apologize more than people in different cultures. For example, many people believe that people from Canada apologize more often than people from the United States. And people from Britain and Japan apologize a lot each day. In fact, in Japan, there are over 20 different ways to apologize.\nVoice 2  \nPeople say “I am sorry” for many different reasons. Some people will say it if they walk into you on the street.\n“Oops! Sorry!”\nVoice 1  \nOther people will say it after they say or do something that is not nice.\n“I’m sorry.”\nVoice 2  \nPeople say sorry if they need your help.\n“Sorry, can you help me?”\nVoice 1  \nOr they may say sorry when something bad happened to another person – even if they had nothing to do with it.\n“I am sorry that happened to you.”\nVoice 2  \nPeople even say “I’m sorry” about the weather!\n“Sorry it’s so cold today!”\nVoice 1  \nIn many of these cases, saying sorry is easy. But what if you hurt someone you love? Why is it sometimes so difficult to say? Telling someone, “I am sorry” should be easy. It is just words! It does not cost any money. It does not require great skill or education. Then why can it be so difficult to do?\nPhoto by Nadine Shaabana\nVoice 2  \nPeople find all sorts of reasons to avoid saying “I am sorry”. They justify what they did. That is, they explain how it was the best thing to do. Sometimes a person who should say sorry only sees what the other person did. They point out what that person did wrong. People do this because saying that you are sorry means admitting that you hurt someone else. People do not like to feel guilty.\nVoice 1  \nBut telling someone “I am sorry” is an important step in fixing relationships. Aaron Lazare is a psychiatrist who studied what an apology – saying sorry – can do. In an article for Psychology Today he wrote,\nVoice 3  \n“I am always amazed by how many of my friends and patients of all kinds hold on to anger for years. It cuts through their own lives and the lives of family and friends. So many of these things could have been avoided or healed with a real apology.”\nVoice 2  \nBut what is a real apology? Many experts say there is more to a good apology than just saying the words “I am sorry”. There are several steps. The first step is to admit that you did something wrong. Be clear, not general. Name what you did. For example, do not say, “I am sorry I hurt you.” Instead, say, “I am sorry that I broke your glasses.”\nVoice 1  \nYou need to do this to show that you understand how your actions affected the other person. You need to explain that you understand their pain.\nVoice 2  \nNext, you need to admit responsibility. You can explain why you did what you did. You can tell the other person that you were not trying to hurt them. But try to imagine what the other person is feeling. And take responsibility for what you did.\nVoice 1  \nFinally, you need to tell the person that you will not do that thing again. Explain how you will change your behavior. This can help them rebuild the trust in your relationship. But make sure you honor your promise to change. You need to say, “I am sorry” But you need to prove it as well.\nVoice 2  \nAlso remember that sometimes, one apology is not enough. Sometimes, when a person is hurt very badly, or has lost their trust in you, it may take a long time for them to accept your apology and forgive you.\nVoice 1  \nHere is an example of what an apology like this could sound like. Imagine the situation from the beginning of this program. You are meeting a friend, and she forgot your meeting. Your friend could apologize like this:\nVoice 4  \n“I am sorry that I did not meet you at the restaurant. It was not kind of me to leave you waiting. Next time I will make sure to set a reminder on my mobile phone so that I do not forget. I hope you will forgive me.”\nPhoto by Dario Valenzuela\nVoice 2  \nMany people think that saying “I am sorry” is a sign of weakness. But Aaron Lazare disagrees. He writes,\nVoice 3  \n“An apology is a show of strength. It is an act of honesty because we admit we did wrong. It is an act of generosity because we are giving worth to the people we hurt. It offers hope for a new relationship, possibly even a stronger one. The apology communicates that we are serious about the relationship. Saying “I am sorry” is an act of courage because it opens us up to shame and the risk of feeling stupid, being rejected, and experiencing new pain from the person we hurt.”\nVoice 1  \nSaying I’m sorry is often difficult. But it is worth the pain for a better relationship. What about you? Have you ever had to say “I am sorry”? Was it easy or difficult? What would have happened if you did not say it?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nWhat do you think of when you hear the word “luxury”? Some people may think of lying in the sand on a beautiful ocean beach. Others may think of sitting on a costly boat in the sun, enjoying a cold drink. These are experiences of luxury. But luxury also involves goods and services. Here are some real luxury goods that people can buy:\nA solid gold baby bed for 16 million dollars\nWomen’s underwear, covered in jewels, for 10 million dollars\nA brand-name watch for 42000 dollars\nA popular hand bag for 4,900 dollars\nA martini drink for 1,000 dollars\nA one-person dinner for 270 dollars\nVoice 2 \nThese are extreme examples of available luxury goods. Most people could never buy these expensive things. But many people can, and do. What makes people want luxury? Is it good for us? Today’s Spotlight is on luxury.\nVoice 1 \nTo some people, luxury means excess, or having more than what is necessary. To others, luxury means goods and services that cost a lot of money. In this case, luxury can represent high quality. Or it can also just represent the image of a particular brand name. The Oxford Dictionary defines luxury as both a state of being and as a thing. It says that Luxury is a state of living with ease and excess. And it says Luxury is a thing that is not needed, but desired, expensive, and difficult to get.\nVoice 2 \nThe global market for luxury goods and services is growing. Euromonitor reports that in five years, from 2010 to 2014, the luxury goods market grew 36%! It estimates that by 2019, the global market for luxury goods will have increased 88% in ten years.\nVoice 1 \nSo why are luxury goods so popular, especially since they are difficult to get? One of the reasons is because they are so difficult to get. It makes people feel like they have status, or a high position, that other people do not have. The website Psychology Today states,\nVoice 3 \n“Buyers purchase luxury goods for different reasons. One reason is that luxury goods give a sense of status and wealth. They help people feel exclusive, or more rare and special than others.”\nVoice 2 \nLuxury brand names want to stay exclusive, or only available to a few people. They encourage the sense that people who buy their products are better than others. If too many people have a particular product, it loses its appeal. Simon Peck is from the House of Luxury, a company that sells watches and jewels. Peck told the BBC,\nVoice 4 \n“When the person who drives you around owns the same watch as you, it is time to look for something better.”\nVoice 1  \nBut not everyone wants luxury just to feel better than everyone else. Some people simply want to be like everyone else. Farnoosh Brock writes a blog on the internet. She wrote about her desire for luxury products. Brock travelled several times to Japan. There, she saw many women with expensive, $5,000 bags. Then, she wanted one. She wrote about it on her blog ProlificLiving. She said that buying particular brands is very popular in Japan.\nVoice 5\n“The brand buying popularity in Japan is about a person’s place in society. The top Western brand names speak loudly in that culture. So naturally, everyone buys them. Possibly this is because everyone wants to belong – to be accepted as an equal.”\nPhoto: Junko Nakase\nVoice 1 \nBut Brock is also conflicted about the strength of her desire for a luxury bag. She writes,\nVoice 5  \n“I really, badly want a luxury Prada bag. Suppose I buy my Prada bag. Will I stop wanting the beautiful sun glasses that go with it? What about the perfect little black dress? Or will I need to learn to redefine the meaning of being pleased and satisfied?”\nVoice 2\nFor other people, luxury is more about beauty. Writer Dana Thomas wrote a book about luxury. Thomas says that not all luxury is greed. She told the Luxury Society,\nVoice 6 \n“Luxury is moral when it comes from creativity and not greed. When you create to make something beautiful, then you are being moral, spiritual, and true.”\nVoice 1 \nLuxury does not have to only represent a fashionable brand. It can also represent high achievement in beauty and creativity. But you still need to have wealth in order to possess luxury.\nVoice 2 \nBuying and experiencing luxury puts a person in a rare group. Many, many people in this world are poor. The World Bank reports that more than 2 billion people live in poverty, and more than 1 billion live in extreme poverty. The United Nations reports that almost half of the world’s children live in extreme poverty. Three hundred million children actually go to bed hungry every night.\nVoice 1 \nThe inequality of people living in poverty and in luxury is very clear. And it brings up an important question: is luxury morally WRONG? Is it wrong to spend 16 million dollars on a golden bed for a baby? Is it wrong to spend thousands of dollars on shoes? That money could buy food for very poor people. It could support schools. It could do many other things too\nVoice 2 \nThis is a complex debate. You may not be able to buy $5,000 shoes. But you may be able to spend $50, or $100, or possibly even $500. These are still large amounts of money! Any of those amounts could help a poor person. But you need shoes too! How can you tell what exact amount is morally right to spend?\nVoice 1 \nChristian teaching moves the question away from numbers and products. The Christian Bible does not say that having wealth is wrong. Or even that desire for beauty and comfort is wrong. It says,\nVoice 3\n“Keep your lives free from the love of money. Be happy with what you have. For Jesus said, ‘I will never leave you.’”\nVoice 2 \nThis teaching asks us to examine our hearts. Jesus’ followers believe that they do not have to chase wealth. They can have money, but they should not love money. They believe that God will provide for their needs, including the presence of Jesus.\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nJames Harrison sits in a comfortable chair. He smiles and talks to the people around him. But there is something strange about why he is sitting. There is a thin, sharp needle in his arm. It is connected by a long thin tube to a machine. James Harrison is giving blood. But this is not a normal blood donation. Harrison has given blood over 1000 times. And his blood is very special. People have used Harrison’s blood to save over two million babies in Australia! Today’s Spotlight is on James Harrison and his amazing blood.\nVoice 2  \nPeople who have had accidents or are having operations sometimes need more blood. So, many people around the world donate, or give, their blood. Hospitals give this blood to their patients. Most healthy people can safely give blood. But Harrison has given a lot more blood than the average person. James Harrison turned 81 in 2018. He is now too old to give blood. But he donated blood for more than 60 years! James Harrison told CNN about why he started giving blood:\nVoice 3  \n“In 1951 I had a chest surgery where they removed a lung. I was 14. When I came out of the operation my father was explaining what had happened. He said I had received 13 liters of blood. My life had been saved by unknown people. My dad was a blood donor. So I said: When I am old enough, I will become a blood donor.”\nVoice 1  \nSoon after he started giving blood, Doctors discovered his blood was different. Doctors could use substances in Harrison’s blood to prevent rhesus disease. Rhesus disease is a condition caused by differences in blood. Babies with rhesus disease can have serious health problems or even die.\nVoice 2  \nTo understand rhesus disease there are some things a person needs to know about blood. All human blood is similar but there are different blood types called O, A, B, and AB. Each blood type is either rhesus negative or positive. For example, there is B positive blood, and B negative blood. People who are rhesus negative cannot receive blood from people who are rhesus positive. Hospitals are very careful not to give people the wrong blood type.\nVoice 1  \nRhesus disease happens when a mother is rhesus negative, but her baby is rhesus positive. When this happens the mother’s body may reject or attack the baby. An antibody is a substance in a person’s blood. The mother’s blood produces antibodies to attack the baby’s cells inside her.\nPhoto by Tim Bish\nVoice 2  \nThen a baby has rhesus disease. Babies with rhesus disease may have many health problems. Their inner organs and body systems do not work correctly. In many cases, they die. Jemma Falkenmire works for the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. She told CNN how this affected her country:\nVoice 4  \n“In Australia, until about 1967, there were thousands of babies dying each year. Doctors did not know why. It was awful. Women were having many miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage. Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody. It changed everything at the time.”\nVoice 1  \nDoctors used the antibody they found to develop an injection. The injection is called Anti-D. It is the only known way to fight rhesus disease. And the donor that Falkenmire is talking about is James Harrison. Anti-D can only be made from the blood of particular donors like him. Doctors give injections of Anti-D to pregnant women at risk of rhesus disease. This stops the mother’s body from attacking the baby’s cells. Then there is a much better chance of having a healthy baby. Millions of women need these injections. But only a few people have the antibodies needed to make Anti-D in their blood.\nVoice 2  \nIn some places in the world they do not even have the choice of receiving Anti-D. In many countries there is not enough information about rhesus disease. In 2018, researchers Zipursky, Bhutani and Odame did a study. They looked at rhesus disease as a major public health problem in developing countries. They published an article in The Lancet. It states that rhesus disease is the cause of death of over 150,000 babies every year, worldwide. They hope that there will be more global research about this important issue.\nVoice 1  \nScientists and doctors have tried to make Anti-D in the laboratory, without blood. But so far it has not worked. People still depend on blood donors. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that in Australia, there are only around 150 people able to give blood to make Anti-D. And about 17 percent of Australian women are at risk. So James Harrison has been an important part of the blood program there for 60 years. Robyn Barlow is the Rh program coordinator. She first asked James to donate his blood for this cause. She told the Herald:\nPhoto by Trust “Tru” Katsande\nVoice 5  \n“Every dose of Anti-D ever made in Australia has James in it – since the very first mother received her dose at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1967.”\nVoice 2  \nJames Harrison’s blood has a very high level of Anti-D. This is probably because he received some of the wrong kind of blood during his surgery as a young man. But James Harrison was also willing to give. He gave blood every two weeks for most of his life. He is a hero in Australia. About two point four million babies were born healthy because of Harrison’s blood. People call him “The Man with the Golden Arm.”\nVoice 1  \nOver his 60 years, James Harrison has donated blood over 1,100 times. He spent half a day every two weeks with a sharp needle in his arm. He cannot donate anymore. But he hopes that other people will take his place. He tells the Australian Red Cross,\nVoice 3  \n“I hope it is a record that someone breaks. That will mean they are dedicated to saving people’s lives.”\nVoice 2  \nHave you ever given blood? Have you ever received someone’s blood? Do you think you would give blood to help someone else?

I’m Bruce Gulland.                                                                                                                                                        \nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Megan Nollet. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nA man is in his kitchen. His name is Seamus Blackley. In front of him is a large, flat wooden board. Blackley covers the board in a special powder. It is a kind of flour made from a grain called einkorn. This is one of the oldest forms of wheat. Then he takes a large ball of dough from a bowl. He begins to push and pull the dough, kneading it into a round shape. The sweet smell of bread fills the room. Then, after some time, he places the dough in an earthen tagine. And he puts it into a hot place to bake. The dough begins to bake. Soon it will be a large loaf of bread. \nVoice 2\nBut this is no ordinary bread. Blackley is making the bread with ancient grains and ancient methods. But Blackley is also using a special yeast. The yeast will make the bread rise or expand. But this yeast is not the kind people normally use. This yeast is also ancient. Using a special process, Blackley took the yeast from Egyptian baking bowls. It is the same yeast used 4,500 years ago!\nVoice 1\nYeast is one of the most important ingredients ever discovered. People use it to make bread, alcoholic drinks, and fermented foods. People have been using yeast for almost 10,000 years! Today’s Spotlight is on the history of yeast. \nVoice 2\nYeast is not an ordinary ingredient, like salt or pepper, or sugar or flour. Yeast is a very small living organism. It is a kind of fungus, related to mushrooms. You cannot see it unless you look at it through a microscope. Yeast feeds on sugars. When yeast eats these sugars, it produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is called fermentation. Carbon dioxide is what causes bread to rise. And the alcohol gives bread its special flavour. \nVoice 1\nThere are hundreds of different kinds of yeast. Some are useful for making food. But others do not work as well. One popular kind of yeast makes a bread called sourdough. Sourdough has a special, tart flavour. Other yeasts make alcoholic beverages. Koji is a yeast used in Japan. The Japanese use it to make a drink called Sake. But there are even yeasts that people do not use much. These are called wild yeasts. \nVoice 2\nHumans first started using yeast in food before people invented writing. Experts think the first use of yeast was probably an accident. Wild yeast probably fell into a sweet drink. And the drink started to ferment. When people tasted it, they found it was good. So, they took some of the drink, and used it to make more. They were taking yeast and growing more, though they did not know it. These were the first brewers. \nVoice 1\nFrom this point, yeast began to change. People began breeding the yeast. If they made something that they liked, they would repeat the process. And they started breeding different yeasts for different things. The yeast began to specialize. Kevin Verstrepen is a scientist at the University of Leuven. He studies yeast genetics. He spoke to Science Daily about this process. \nVoice 3\n“Sometimes, early brewers had a very good fermentation. They were smart enough to harvest the yeast. They used it to start the next batch, even if they did not know what was in it. Reusing the yeast to make beer separated it from nature. The yeasts were changing in the brewery.”\nVoice 2\nRemember Seamus Blackley from the beginning of this program? When Blackley started making his bread, he was excited because of these changes. The Egyptian yeast was a lot like sourdough bread. But what was yeast like almost five thousand years ago? Blackley did not know what it would taste like. When he finally tasted his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter about his experience.\nVoice 4\n“The bread is light and full of air, especially for a loaf made from these ingredients. The smell and flavour are incredible. It is very different. You can easily tell the difference, even if you are not excited about bread.”\nVoice 1\nThe first evidence of people using yeast comes from China. The ancient Chinese made a drink called Kui. They used water, honey, rice, and fruit. Drinks made with yeast had a lot of advantages. Of course, people liked the effects of alcohol. But drinks made with yeast were also safer than water. In ancient times, drinking water could be dangerous. It could make a person sick very easily. But alcohol kills many of the diseases that live in water. So, you could drink it without getting sick. Many civilizations used this to their advantage. In ancient Greece, people mixed water with strong wine. This killed the bacteria in the water. And, because it was mixed, they could drink it most of the day without being drunk. \nVoice 2\nBut making foods with yeast also makes them more delicious and healthier. These are fermented foods. The yeast breaks down sugars that may be difficult to digest. Kefir is a fermented drink made from milk. It is from Eastern Europe. For most people, milk is very difficult to digest after childhood. This is because of a sugar called lactose, which most people cannot digest. But the yeast in Kefir breaks lactose down. Because of this, Kefir has almost no lactose in it. The yeast makes milk safe for people who cannot drink milk!\nVoice 1\nMany ancient people also used yeast to help in food storage. Fermenting foods in this way is called pickling. Fermenting, or pickling, makes food last longer. But it also changes the flavor. Kimchi is one of the most famous pickled foods from Korea. Kimchi is fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radish. In ancient times, people made kimchi so that these vegetables would last through the winter. But soon, people began to make kimchi because they liked the taste. \nVoice 2\nToday, we do not need yeast to clean water or to preserve food. But over the years, humans have developed a taste for fermented foods. We eat them now because we like them! We continue to make them because they are part of our traditions. And they connect us to people who lived thousands of years ago. When he made his bread, Blackley wrote on Twitter:\nVoice 4\n“This is very exciting. I am so amazed that it worked. It is such a magical thing. We can share food in a rather genuine way with our distant ancestors.” \nVoice 1\nDo you use yeast in your diet? What fermented foods do you eat? Do you make any yourself?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.\nVoice 2\nIf you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.\nVoice 1\nBees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.\nVoice 2\nBees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.\nVoice 1\nBut to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!\nVoice 2\nIt takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.\nVoice 1\nThe day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.\nVoice 2\nWhen the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:\nVoice 3\n“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”\nVoice 1\nThe hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.\nVoice 2\nBut this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation is a local organization in Southern India. It has worked with the honey hunters for fifteen years. They aim to protect the environment and local culture. Robert Leo works for the Keystone Foundation. He tells the organization Slow Food International:\nVoice 4\n“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”\nVoice 2\nMany young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nA man is sitting at his desk, typing at his computer. Outside of his window, the sun shines brightly. Birds are singing. It is a very pleasant morning. There is nothing frightening around him. But he is very worried. He is so worried he cannot concentrate. There is a tightness in his chest. There is a feeling of heat on his shoulders. His body is telling him to run. It is signaling to him that, somewhere, there is danger. The man knows there is no danger. But he cannot stop these feelings. He does not even know why he is afraid!\nVoice 2\nThis man is living with an anxiety disorder. These psychological differences in the brain cause people to be afraid of things that do not make sense. Or they cause people to worry too much. But many people have anxieties, even if they do not have a disorder. Today’s Spotlight is on anxiety, and how to live with it.\nVoice 1\nThere are many different kinds of anxiety disorders. Some, people are born with. Other people get anxiety later in their lives. But all people with anxiety have one similarity: an overactive amygdala. The amygdala is a part of the brain. It keeps emotions even and regular. It also tells the body when something dangerous is around. It causes the emotion of fear. In a healthy person, the amygdala does not activate much. But in a person with anxiety, the amygdala is very sensitive. It can activate because of things that do not make sense. Or it can activate for no reason at all. \nVoice 2\nAnxiety disorders can make people’s lives very difficult. An anxiety disorder can cause people to act strangely. This can be very distressing. And it can hurt their lives, socially. One of these disorders is called obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD. A person with OCD has disturbing thoughts. These fears will not go away. But a person with OCD will try to get rid of them. She will perform particular actions to get rid of her anxiety. For example, if she is afraid of getting sick, she might wash her hands. But this does not make the fear leave. So she will wash her hands many times in a row. She will wash until her fears go away. Sam Wicky is a sculptor. He has OCD. In 2020, he talked to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America about his OCD.\nVoice 3\n“My OCD began at age seven. I remember sitting on a chair in front of my family. I opened my mouth wide and inhaled a lot of air. I was looking at my mother. I then held up my hand and blew out the air onto it. I would repeat this action over and over. But no one would say a word. They would watch in confusion. \nAs more time passed, my OCD got worse. I began acting out other strange rituals. It was becoming difficult to get dressed every day. I would count as I put my clothes on. I would have to redo my actions if I started thinking of something bad. I knew something was wrong with me. But I could not talk about it. I then became frightened that my brothers would become like me – that they would also act out strange rituals.\nVoice 1\nAnxiety can also make it difficult to be in society. Some people with anxiety have a hard time doing their jobs or going to school. Kathleen Munro is an employee at Anxiety Canada. She has panic disorder. This condition caused her to have sudden, intense times of panic, or panic attacks. During these panic attacks, fear would overwhelm her. She would not be able to move, because she was shaking so badly. It made her feel like she was going to die. She wrote for Anxiety Canada’s blog:\nVoice 4\n“I could not control it. It left me feeling helpless. I could not commit to anything. I could end up caught in my panic at any time. I missed events with my friends because I did not want to admit I was struggling. I was so tired from pretending to be ok, and to avoid making others uncomfortable. I struggled to feel safe. And this kept me from fully living.”\nVoice 2\nOne of the best things a person with anxiety can do for themselves is to be with other people. Talking to others can help them change the way they think. If someone you know has anxiety, it is important to keep in contact with them. Be available to listen, even if they do not respond. People with anxiety also often suffer from depression. Offering encouragement and support can help distract them from their fears. It can help put them on the way to getting real help. But do not try to solve their anxiety. And do not try to eliminate causes of anxiety. This can actually make the disorder worse. And it could make them depend on you. Joseph McGuire is a doctor at John Hopkins University. He writes,\nVoice 5\n“Trying to get rid of someone’s anxiety seems really thoughtful and sweet. But anxiety does not usually go away. Over time, if people avoid difficult situations, the anxiety grows. And the person begins to ask more and more from you instead of working on their problem.”\nVoice 1\nIf you have anxiety, there are many ways of working through these disorders. There is no single cure. Anxiety disorders do not go away. Instead, these are changes that you can make to your life that may help. Here are some ways of dealing with anxiety:\nVoice 3\nGet regular exercise. Keeping active helps reduce stress, even in people with severe anxiety.\nVoice 4\nAvoid caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. These substances can make anxiety worse.\nVoice 5\nDrink lots of water. Not having enough water can make anxiety more difficult to deal with.\nVoice 3\nSlow down and find time for yourself. Anxiety can often come from living under stressful circumstances. Avoiding those circumstances can help. But sometimes it is enough just to take a break.\nVoice 4\nSeek medical help. While there is no cure for anxiety, there are many treatments that work. Medications called anti-depressants are very effective.\nVoice 5\nTalk to someone or go to therapy. Talking to a professional can help you understand your mind. A therapist can give you methods of working through your anxiety. They can help train you to overcome many of your fears. Anxiety does not have to rule your life. \nVoice 2\nDo you have anxiety? Do you know anyone with anxiety? What do you do to help? You can leave a comment on our website at www.spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIt is the year 1803. A four-year old boy is on a boat. He is doing an important job. He is helping to bring a virus from Spain to Central America. There the virus will protect people from an even worse disease. This is one of the first times a vaccine will be traveling across an ocean. And this boy is carrying the vaccine in his own body.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nIn the past, vaccines were transported like this. Today, we have better technology. But health experts still struggle to send important vaccines to the farthest places on earth. Today’s Spotlight is on the ways people transport vaccines around the world.\nVoice 1 \nVaccines are a kind of medicine. They protect people against deadly diseases. The first vaccine was for the terrible disease smallpox. In some parts of the world, half of the people who got sick with smallpox died. But doctors in Europe had found a way to protect people from getting smallpox. They infected people with a similar virus called cowpox. Cowpox did not make people as sick. When they got better from cowpox, their bodies knew how to protect them from getting the smallpox virus too.\nThis graphic shows the steps Edward Jenner followed to create the smallpox vaccine;Srcyr16, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nIn the 1800s, doctors took fluid from the cowpox on one person. Then they injected the fluid into another person. Soon whole villages of people in Europe were safe from smallpox.\nVoice 1 \nBut across the ocean many people were still dying from smallpox. Doctors wanted to bring the cowpox virus to these places. They needed a way to transport the cowpox virus a very far distance. So Spanish doctors took 22 young boys on a long trip to Central America. These boys were orphans who had no parents. They were between three and 10 years old.\nVoice 2 \nBefore the trip began, doctors infected two of the boys with cowpox. Every 10 days of the trip, doctors took fluid from the infected boys’ cowpox. Then they infected the next two boys. By the time the boys reached Central America, only one of them had a spot of cowpox left on his body. But that was enough!\nVoice 1 \nPeople celebrated the boys for bringing cowpox to protect them. Happy crowds cheered with bells. The boys were placed with new families. They were promised a good education. Because of these boys, as many as 12,000 people were protected from smallpox in just two months in this area. From there, the vaccine could spread into the wider Americas.\nVoice 2 \nBut today we wonder about these boys. Did they want to help in this way? Did they get to decide? Probably not. Some were too young to even understand what was happening to them. But because of these boys, many lives were saved.\nVoice 1 \nAuthorities can transport vaccines in much better ways today. Scientists and doctors have learned a lot since the 1800s. But again, we must send a very important vaccine all around the world. Today, people in every country need the COVID-19 vaccine. How will we transport vaccines for COVID-19 to parts of the world that are hard to reach?\nVoice 2 \nTransporting the COVID-19 vaccines is challenging. The vaccines must be kept very cold. There are parts of West and Central Africa where people do not always have electricity. UNICEF is working to set up new refrigerators there. Solar power from the sun will help to keep these refrigerators cold. Jean-Cedric Meeus works for UNICEF. He says:\nVoice 3 \n“West and Central Africa is one of the most complex places you will find. We are transporting COVID-19 vaccines to major cities. But we must also deliver them to very remote villages. We found that there was not enough cold storage. Then we set about building almost 20,000 solar-powered refrigerators — all the way from the coast to the forests.”\nA truck which transports SDD refrigerators to Health Posts. ©UNICEF Ethiopia/2018/Mulugeta Ayene;“Solar Direct Drive (SDD) refrigerators P” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by UNICEF Ethiopia\nVoice 1 \nRobin Nandy also works for UNICEF. He explains that they will use many forms of transportation to get the vaccines where they need to go. COVID vaccines will travel by boat to small islands and to villages along the Amazon River. Snowmobiles will have to transport vaccines in winter conditions to parts of Alaska that are very far away. Nandy imagines vaccines will travel by motorcycle, drone, elephant, horse, and even camel. He explains:\nVoice 4 \n“This has never happened before. We are trying to send a new vaccine to every country in the world in the same year.”\nVoice 2 \nSome far away island countries have no reported cases of COVID yet. But it is still important to get the vaccine to the people there. These communities may have fewer medical resources. If someone there gets COVID-19, the disease could spread very quickly.\nVoice 1 \nAuthorities may even start using drones to transport vaccines to hard-to-reach parts of the world. These small machines can be controlled from a far distance. Drones can reach places like rural India. Moz Siddiqui works for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. He explained to the Thomas Reuters Foundation:\nVoice 5 \n“Every single COVID-19 vaccine is so important. That is why it is necessary to make sure that countries have the support and tools to transport vaccines quickly and well to those who need them. Drones help us by adding another kind of transportation. They are a special solution to a problem faced by many countries.”\nVoice 2 \nTransporting vaccines has often been difficult. Little boys once sailed across the ocean. Today drones fly with no pilot at all. People have always needed to be creative to send vaccines across long distances. And they will need to continue to be creative today.\nCOVAX Vaccines, Moderna, Ukraine, July 18, 2021;“COVAX Vaccines, Moderna, Ukraine, July 1” (CC BY-ND 2.0) by usembassykyiv\nVoice 1 \nBy early August 2021, almost 15 percent of the world’s population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. And health experts were giving over 38 million doses of the vaccine each day. But there is still a lot of work to do to get these vaccines everywhere they need to go.\nVoice 2 \nIs a COVID-19 vaccine easy to get where you live? Are organizations doing enough to get it to you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nSusan Saunders was just a young mother. But her own mother began to suffer from dementia. Dementia is not a disease. It is a general loss of skills such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. A person with dementia cannot do normal things on their own. This can happen for several medical reasons. Saunders knew that she did not want her own daughters to have to watch her getting old this way. She began to research how to stay healthy while growing old. She told the news website The Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n“I decided to do everything I could to increase my chances of aging well.”\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nSome people say that age is just a number. But everyone grows old. As people age, their bodies and minds change. They are not able to move as fast or be as strong as they once were. Sometimes people get diseases that they cannot prevent. However, there are things people can do to get the best chance of living a long and healthy life. Today’s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life as you grow old.\nVoice 1 \nIn many ways, what people need in their lives is always the same. People need to eat good food. They need to avoid smoking and other harmful things. However, older people may need to do a little more. They need to be more careful because they may not recover quickly if something goes wrong.\nA glass of water; Image by Ulrike Leone from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe first tip to living well is to drink enough water.  There are three reasons why drinking water is important as people age. First, as people grow older their bodies begin to contain less water. Second, the kidneys stop working as well. These organs clean the body’s water. And third, research shows that older people do not feel thirsty as soon as younger people.\nVoice 1 \nUnder good conditions this is usually not a big problem. But if there is a medical problem that leads to blood loss, or even a very hot day, older people can become dehydrated and sick. In fact, in France during the summer of 2003 over 14,000 people died because of causes related to not drinking enough water. Most of these people were old people.\nVoice 2 \nThe second tip for healthy living is to spend time outside. Scientists are discovering that being outside has many health benefits. Fresh air and sunshine improve lungs and skin. It can also reduce stress. But as people grow old, they may not be able to walk as well. People can struggle to get outside, especially if there is snow or ice. Older people can sometimes spend weeks or months without going outside. But research shows that even 30 minutes outside can make a big difference to a person’s health and attitude.\nAn older couple spend some time outside; Photo by RODNAE Productions from Pexels\nVoice 1 \nThe third tip to living a healthy life as you get older is to think about the past in a healthy way. The average length of life is different depending on where in the world you live. But all aging people understand that they have less time left to live. This can make them ask a lot of questions. Erik Erikson was a famous psychologist. He developed a series of steps of human life. Kendra Cherry wrote about Erikson’s work for the website VeryWellMind.com. She writes:\nVoice 4 \n“Success at this older time of life means that people are able to look back at their life with a sense of happiness. They can face the end of life with a sense of wisdom and no regrets. Erikson defined this wisdom as an “informed and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself.” Those who feel proud of their achievements will feel a sense of wholeness. These individuals will get wisdom, even when looking at death. Those who are not successful during this time of life will feel that their life has been wasted. They will experience many regrets. This person will be left with feelings of bitterness and no hope.”\nVoice 2 \nThe fourth tip to living a healthy life in old age is to give to your community. A person can give money. But adding to your community is so much more than money. Throughout life, a person learns a lot of different skills. Some skills are learned at work. But some skills are learned through hobbies or other life experiences. A person can use the skills he has learned to improve the community around him. A person can discover meaning and purpose to life when they find a way to add to their community. It is also a good way to help those people that they care about.\nA grandmother teaches her grandchild how to knit; Photo by Alex Green from Pexels\nVoice 1 \nThe last tip for living a healthy life as we age is to keep learning. Erika Andersen is a writer for Forbes. She says in many places of the world people are living longer. But they are not always living better. She thinks one solution is to stay connected to the world through learning. This could be reading about something you do not know much about. It could be trying a new food – or even meeting a new person. Andersen writes:\nVoice 5 \n“One of the best ways to stay active as you get older is to always choose to learn new things. The least interesting older people I know are those who find a comfortable place and stop. They do the same things. They have the same conversations. They express the same opinions. Choose to learn something totally new every week or every month. There is nothing like being bad at something to wake you up and shake you out of your understanding. And when you start to get good at it, it can make you feel as excited as a six-year-old.”\nVoice 2 \nWhat about you? How will you stay healthy as you grow older?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nWhen Betty Apio married her husband many years ago, both their families were full of hope and happiness. Apio lives in the country of Uganda. In Uganda, as in many countries, everyone expects women to have children. Many people there believe that women exist to have children. To fail at this, is to fail as a wife and as a woman.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nAfter Apio was married, her husband prepared their house for children. Then they waited. They tried again and again to have children. But the children never came.\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight is on infertility. Some people are not able to have children — even when they are trying for over a year. This is infertility. There are many medical reasons for infertility. But today’s Spotlight is on the social attitudes surrounding infertility.\nVoice 2 \nBetty Apio and her husband went to a doctor to find out what was wrong. She received some medical treatments from the doctor. But they did not work. To make the situation worse, her husband’s family began to make fun of her and call her bad names. In Uganda, a man can have more than one wife. So, his family told him to find another woman, a second wife. This new wife gave him two children. Now Apio lives a different kind of life. She told the Washington Post Foreign Service:\nVoice 3 \n“People will never give me respect. They believe I have no value. They insult me. They say: ‘You barren woman, you are useless!’ It is horrible. I must be strong or I will not survive.”\nVoice 1 \nInfertility affects people all around the world. It does not matter if you have money, education, or power. And it affects both men and women. Experts say that globally, about 15 percent of all couples who are at the age to have children are infertile. In some places, this number can be as high as 20 percent.\nVoice 2 \nInfertility is common. But people do not often talk about this problem. Many people feel great pressure to have children, even if they are successful in other areas of life. To men and women who want to have children but are not able, the pressure can be crushing. And often, if a couple cannot have children, people blame the woman.\nA women looks to the distance; Image by Iulian Ursache from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThis can lead women especially to feel shame. They believe that they are alone in their struggle with infertility. They may even avoid talking about children. They may avoid attending events where children will be present. They may even find it difficult to be happy when children are born to other people.\nVoice 2 \nIt is difficult to be infertile. But the social attitude about infertility only makes the problem worse. As in Betty Apio’s case, the community can make infertile people feel great shame. But people should not feel shame about their infertility. They should not feel alone. In fact, some women are speaking out to encourage other people who may be struggling. By talking together, they are finding hope.\nVoice 1 \nBetty Apio wanted to be one of these women. She decided to talk about her situation. She wanted to share her story with other women. She did not want other people to feel like she did.\nVoice 2 \nApio has found some help at a support center in Kampala. At the center there were groups that help women. These groups explain the medical reasons for infertility. Women can connect with other women. And they can connect with doctors who can help them at a fertility center.\nVoice 1 \nPrakesh Patel runs one of the fertility centres in Kampala. He told the Washington Post that many women struggle to visit him. Women often do not want anyone to know they are going to a fertility centre. And they share great sadness. He said,\nVoice 4 \n“I say to them, ‘This is not a disease. There are many like you. You do not have to feel shame.”\nA negative pregnancy test; Photo by RODNAE Productions from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nIf you or someone you know is infertile, the best thing you can do is to find people who support you. Surround yourself with people who will love you and care for you. These people may be in your own family, but they may not. They may be some friends or people from your community.\nVoice 1 \nIf you do not feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, there may be resources in your community. Many fertility centers have support groups. They are a good place to learn about what medical treatments are possible in your area. These treatments are not possible for everyone. They may cost a lot of money. And they do not always work. But the most important treatment is the support and love to face the challenge of infertility.\nVoice 2 \nThe emotional pain of infertility is very real. This is true even for people who are able to build their family in other ways such as through medicine or through adoption, caring for a child without parents.\nVoice 1 \nMany people who are infertile feel anger and shame. They may wonder why this could happen to them. They may want to feel peace and acceptance. But they also may not want to lose the dream of having children.\nVoice 2 \nShannon Woodward wrote a book about her struggle to make peace with her infertility called “Inconceivable”. It was not easy for her. Her desire to have her own children never went away. Woodward is a Christian. She says she was able to see how God can work through her pain. She writes:\nVoice 5 \n“For years, I hated my broken body parts. I took my worth from what I could or could not produce. I asked God to heal my body. But it turns out he had a better plan. He healed parts of me I did not know were broken. He put new skin on old wounds. He freed me from my pain and self-hatred.”\nTwo women hold hands; Image by AndPan614 from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nInfertility is painful. But facing infertility can bring healing. If you are infertile, look for support. And if you know an infertile person, offer them love and support.\nVoice 2 \nDo you know someone who has struggled to have a baby?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen a person try to stand up and then make this sound? Did it make you think they were old? Did it make you wonder what happened to them? As we grow, our bodies become less able to move. We must slow down when we move or exercise or play sport. We must be careful. If we are not careful, we can hurt our neck, our knees, or our back. When this happens, it can take weeks or even months to feel better. And even simple things, like sitting down, become a problem. This does not only happen to much older people. It starts happening as we enter adulthood.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThis program is part of a series of programs called Tips for a Healthy Life. Other programs focused on pregnancy, the first year of life, childhood, and the teenage years. Today’s Spotlight is on how to live a healthy adult life and recover from injury.\nVoice 1 \nBefore we begin, we should note that all information in this program is not meant to replace going to a doctor. If you have a serious injury or sickness, you should go to a doctor for help.\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe human body is an amazing thing. It can fix itself. This is a miracle that most people do not think about. Julie K. Silver is a doctor who specializes in helping people recover after serious sickness or injury. She is amazed at how the human body works to repair itself after an injury. She wrote for AARP.com:\nVoice 3 \n“Your body works hard to help you recover. Even if you do little to help the process along. There is a lot happening in your body, both day and night, to help you to heal. When you are injured, white blood cells go to the injury to stop things getting worse. Other blood cells remove dead cells and help to control inflammation. If you break a bone, bone cells build the rough edges back together. There are so many cells assisting us in healing that we could never count them all. These processes happen on their own. But there are things smart patients can do to speed and strengthen their recovery.”\nVoice 1 \nSo what are these things that can help people heal faster and better? The first and best thing you can do is to sleep more. Everyone knows that a good night of sleep makes you feel great. But scientists in many different fields of study believe sleep helps in growth, recovery, and mental health. Most healthy people are not getting enough sleep. And Dr. Silver says that people recovering from an injury need even more. She says,\nVoice 3 \n“If you are like most people, you need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. During sickness you may need more rest than that. Your body’s healing processes require sleep to work. For example, your body produces the chemical melatonin when you sleep. This chemical increases your immune system and helps repair your body. It may even help prevent some forms of cancer. But if you are not sleeping enough at night, your melatonin levels can be reduced.”\n\nClick here to see the Advanced version of this program\nVoice 2 \nThe next tip for recovering after injury is to continue to move in healthy ways. Do not make the injury worse. Many athletes continue to exercise and play sport when they are injured. They do not know the difference between pain from effort and pain from injury. In these cases, they may need total rest. But many experts say that light activity can help people heal faster. In fact, a study from 2005 showed that wounds healed faster when people moved.\nImage by Louis Moore from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nResearchers from Ohio State University in Columbus studied a group of older adults from ages 55 to 77. All the adults were healthy. During the study, about half of the adults exercised three times a week for three months. The other half did not exercise during this time. Each person in the study also received a small but deep wound on the upper part of their arm. Researchers took pictures of the wound over time as it healed. And the adults recorded their exercise. At the end of the study, researchers discovered something amazing. The wounds of the people who exercised healed about ten days faster than the wounds of the people who did not exercise.\nVoice 2 \nThe next tip to recover after an injury is to eat good food and drink enough water. Food is the first medicine. What we put in our bodies becomes our bodies. Foods like fish, eggs, and yogurt can help with broken bones. Meat, nuts, and seeds can help our blood. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C. Vitamin C helps people stay healthy and heal from cuts on the skin. Eating good food is important for all people. And it is very important when recovering from a sickness or injury.\nImage by Anant Sharma from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe final tip to help recover after an injury is to work on the mental parts of recovery. An injury often requires us to change the way we live. This can be frustrating. We want to be able to live at the same fast speed that we always did. But an injury can make us slow down. Carrie Cheadle is a professor of sports psychology at John F. Kennedy University. She told Outside Magazine how people cannot deny what it will take to recover. She says:\nVoice 4 \n“You should not ignore the frustration and sadness that come with injury. But you should look at all the good things in your life. Let yourself have some joy. It makes you understand that everything is not horrible. It is often as simple as focusing on something that makes you happy that is not exercise or sport. You may even try keeping a journal and writing down three things you are thankful for every night. This can help move your thoughts away from your injury.”\nVoice 2 \nHave you ever had an injury? What did you do to recover? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3 \nHere is tonight’s top story: something is happening to young people around the world. We have reports of young people acting strangely. Young people are changing very quickly. They sleep all the time. They eat large amounts of food. They smell very bad. They are only able to communicate with their friends and not with their parents. If you see a young person, use extreme care. They may become angry for no reason. What is causing these changes? Is there any hope for these young people?\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nYou may wish you had heard a news story like this before you knew a teenager. You may be happy to learn that there are answers for some of these questions! Today’s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life during the teenage years.\nVoice 2 \nYoung people go through a lot of changes. These changes are called puberty. Puberty is the process of a body changing from a child into an adult. It can begin as early as age nine in girls. It usually begins later in boys. In boys, puberty usually begins around age 12.\nVoice 1 \nThe bodies of young people change a lot. Their bodies can grow many centimeters in just a few years. Young people grow taller and more muscular. Girls develop breasts and their bodies become able to have babies. Boys’ voices become lower and their bodies become ready to make a baby with a woman.\nImage by Pexels from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nYoung people also experience a lot of changes outside their bodies. Their relationships change. Young people depend less on their parents. They may become busy with school. Michelle Zehr is a writer for the website Livestrong.com. She wrote about the pressure on young people.\nVoice 4 \n“Your teenage years come with a lot of pressures. These include the pressures to fit in and do well in school. There is school, sports, special interests and even a part-time job. It can be difficult to find the time to lead a healthy life. But as a young person it is important to remember that the healthy things you do now will help you through the rest of your life.”\nVoice 1 \nYoung people can do several things to have a healthy life. The first thing a young person can do is to get enough sleep. Experts say that young people need between nine and nine and a half hours of sleep every night. This is because young people are growing and changing so fast. And sleep can help with these changes.\nVoice 2 \nThe second thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to wash and care for skin and body. Charles Wibbelsman is a doctor for children and a writer. He wrote for the website WebMD.\nVoice 5 \n“Parents too often think that children will somehow just learn what they need to know about cleaning their body. But that is not true. Someone has to teach them.”\nVoice 1 \nSomeone needs to teach children about washing their body, skin, and hair. This includes changing clothes regularly, cleaning teeth, and know when their feet smell bad. Young people will not find these things difficult. But they must remember this new responsibility.\nVoice 2 \nThe third thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to eat and drink good foods. During these years, young people eat a lot of food. But they do not always eat good, healthy food. Sometimes young people eat too much food that is fast and easy to eat, such as sweets, pizza, or boxed foods. They do not eat enough fresh food like fruits and vegetables.\nVoice 1 \nThe fourth thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to avoid risky behaviour. Parents give advice to young people. But young people like to test limits. They may smoke or try drugs and alcohol. They may chew betel-nut or tobacco. These things can become addictive. Once a person begins using them, it can be difficult to stop. They are harmful to the body.\nImage by karosieben from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nYoung people feel a lot of pressure to do these things. Young people want to be like their friends. If their friends drink alcohol, they will want to drink alcohol too. Young people may feel less worried about what other people think of them if they use drugs or alcohol. Drugs and alcohol can make a person feel good for a short time. But these things can hurt your body in ways that will only appear years later.\nVoice 1 \nThe other common risky behaviour is sex. Young people start to be interested in sex. Sex is an important part of life. But it does have different risks when people are not married. Zehr writes,\nVoice 4 \n“If you have decided to have sex as a teenager, be smart about your health. To avoid pregnancy and getting a sexually transmitted disease, use protection in the form of condoms, birth control pills, or other methods. Remember that not all birth control methods protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Talk to your doctor about the birth control methods that are right for you. When you become sexually active, make a yearly trip to your doctor.”\nImage by Hong Manh from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe final thing is for parents. Parents need to love and support their children through these changes. Parents experience changes too. They need to begin giving their children more responsibility and choice. Parents can tell their children that these changes are a normal part of life. The website Better Health channel is made by the government of the Australian state of Victoria. It advises parents:\nVoice 6 \n“You may need to accept that you will not have total control over your child’s choices and life direction. It may help to trust that you have done your best as a parent. But if your child makes new friendships that lead to acts that concern you, such as violence or drug taking, you may feel stress. In these times it may be useful to seek help from a family counsellor or other service which offers parenting help or classes. Let your child know you are there for them, no matter how old they are.”\nVoice 1 \nWhat do you think makes the teenage years better? What is the best advice you can give a teenager?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Adam Navis.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIt is very difficult to live your best life if you are not healthy. Today’s Spotlight program is part of a series of programs about living a healthy life. The first Spotlight program was on having a healthy pregnancy. The second Spotlight program was on a healthy first year of life. Today’s Spotlight is on three things people can do to help children to have a healthy childhood.\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nBeing a parent takes a lot of work. But there are ways to help you raise a healthy and happy child. These three things are taking care of the physical body, caring for the mind, and having healthy relationships with other people.\nVoice 1 \nThe first way to have a healthy childhood is to take care of the physical body. If a child lives in a dangerous situation, they cannot have a healthy life. Parents cannot stop all hurt and harm. Children often get hurt playing hard or falling down. This is one of the ways children learn about what is safe and what is not. But parents should work to keep children as safe as possible. Parents need to be careful around water, especially with young children. Other concerns are fire, guns, and knives. Children like to explore. But they should not explore things that could lead to injury or death.\nVoice 2 \nParents should also take children for regular medical tests. Doctors examine if children are growing. Doctors also give vaccines. Vaccines are medicines given to children before they get sick. They are tested and safe. Sometimes vaccines can seem frightening. However, according to the United States Center for Disease Control website:\nVoice 3 \n“Vaccines during childhood are very important. That is because they help protect children before they are exposed to life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to make sure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the right ages.”\nPhoto by James Gathany, Judy Schmidt, USCDCP on Pixnio\nVoice 1 \nThe last part of caring for a child’s physical body is making sure the child is eating good food and getting enough exercise. A report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, says:\nVoice 4 \n“Children ages three through five should be encouraged to move and be active. They should do things such as throwing games and bicycle or tricycle riding. To strengthen bones, young children should hop, skip, jump, and roll around. A target may be three hours each day. This can be all kinds of exercises: light, moderate, or fast. Children ages six through 17 years can achieve most health benefits by doing moderate and fast physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes or more each day.”\nVoice 2 \nRemember that most children learn by watching what adults do. If adults are eating good food and exercising, children will also want to do these things. And if adults around them smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol, children may do that. If adults spend hours looking at a phone, then children will want to do that too. Parents need to teach with their words. But they also need to show children with their actions.\nVoice 1 \nPhysical bodies are important. But adults must also take care of children’s minds. Children are learning all the time. And they start learning even before they are in school. Even babies learn to see faces, shapes, and different colors. Young children learn about what things feel like, what different foods taste like, and how to move and walk.\nImage by Joshua Tee from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nWhen children are old enough, they should attend school. It is not enough that some children get an education. A good education is important for all boys and girls. And education is important for the future of the whole world. Jessie Woolley-Wilson is the CEO of Dreambox. Dreambox is an online mathematics teaching program. She wrote for Fast Company magazine.\nVoice 5 \n“Our shared future depends on every child receiving a quality education. They will need to be ready to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. It does not matter their sex, race, or where they live.”\nVoice 1 \nThe third thing people can do to create a healthy childhood is to take care of a child’s heart. That is, children need good relationships with other people. It is also important that a child feels emotionally connected to a community of people. Jason Williams is the Director of Quality and Safety at the Children’s Hospital Colorado. He wrote about connecting with children on the hospital’s website:\nVoice 6 \n“Anything can connect with children. You can go on a bike ride, walk the dog, talk in the car, or let them help you shop. Any time you spend around your children can be a chance for connection. It does not have to be complex. With a baby, it could be as simple as 30 seconds of play or touching her toes. With older kids, it can just be taking time to stop and look at something your child is interested in. You can comment on it and see the world through her eyes. It could be playing a game — even a video game. Or it could be having a teenager show you what he is posting on Instagram. The important thing is to get on their level, be in their world.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nLife is not easy for parents or children. Some parents cannot create a healthy space for their children, even if they want to. They do not have enough money or experience. They may not be able to get good medical care. They may not be able to send their child to the best school. Yet all parents can offer love and connection to their children. And love and connection are two of the most important things people can give to children.\nVoice 1 \nWhat else do you think helps a child live a healthy life?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nOne morning Mary felt strange. She did not feel sick, but she did feel different. She and her husband had been trying to have a baby. Mary wondered if she could be pregnant. So, she took a pregnancy test. She was pregnant! Mary and her husband were going to have a baby. They were filled with excitement and joy. But soon, they felt something else — worry. Mary worried that she did not know what she should do to have a healthy pregnancy. A healthy pregnancy would help her baby to be healthy.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nThis is a made-up story. But these are common worries for many pregnant women and their partners. Pregnancy can have risks. But there are also things people can do to have a healthy pregnancy. These things cannot make sure the baby is healthy. But they can give the baby and mother a better chance at health. Today’s Spotlight is on simple tips for a healthy pregnancy.\nVoice 1 \nThere is a lot of advice for pregnant women. Some of this advice is cultural. Different cultures offer different advice for pregnant women. Or it seems like there is too much advice. A pregnant woman may feel like it is all too much to do! But these tips are general. They are simple ways that pregnant women can be a little healthier.\nVoice 2 \nThe first tip for pregnant mothers is to eat good foods. A baby still living inside a mother’s body is called a fetus. The fetus gets all it needs from what a mother eats. For a baby to be healthy, it needs healthy foods as a fetus. Pregnant women should eat vegetables and fruits. They should eat whole grains like oats and rice. Protein is also important. It is found in foods like eggs, beans, nuts, and meats. It is also good to eat some cheese or yogurt.\nImage by Andrey Cojocaru from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nHowever, there are some foods pregnant women should avoid. Many health experts say that pregnant women should not eat unwashed foods, soft cheeses, or meat that is not cooked. These foods can contain harmful bacteria. This bacteria can cause the woman to lose important nutrients in her body. It can even cause the woman’s body to reject the fetus. Some experts also say that pregnant women should limit their caffeine. This is the drug found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks. Too much caffeine can result in the baby having unhealthy low birth-weight.\nVoice 2 \nBut the two things that women should ALWAYS avoid during pregnancy are smoking and alcohol. Smoking can result in early birth before the baby is ready. It can also cause the fetus not to grow properly. And pregnant women should avoid all alcohol. The Center for Disease Control in the United States writes on their website about alcohol and pregnancy. They say:\nVoice 3 \n“There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time during pregnancy to drink. All kinds of alcohol are equally harmful. This includes wine and beer. Alcohol in the mother’s blood goes into the baby. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, death, and several physical, behavioral, and mental problems.”\nVoice 1 \nOne thing a woman should drink while pregnant is clean water. Water is a good drink for all people. Water improves blood flow, skin health, and digestion. If a woman does not drink enough water during pregnancy, she may not produce enough breast milk. She may get a headache or feel more tired.\nVoice 2 \nAnother tip for a healthy pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin. These vitamins are designed to help pregnant women. Sometimes it is difficult for a woman to get all she needs through food. But a good prenatal vitamin will include iron for the blood, calcium for bones, folic acid for the health of the baby, and many other things.\nImage by Ri Butov from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe next tip for a healthy pregnancy is to sleep a lot. It can be difficult to sleep during pregnancy. As the fetus grows inside the mother, it pushes her internal organs around. Woman can suffer from back pain and difficulty breathing. But sleep can help everyone. When people sleep enough, they reduce stress, build muscle, repair body tissues, and process things they have learned that day.\nVoice 2 \nA pregnant woman may have to try new things to be able to sleep. The best position for her to sleep in is on her side. Sleeping on her back or stomach can cause problems. A woman can use pillows or other soft things to get into a comfortable position. If possible, a woman’s partner should encourage her to sleep longer. He could take on a few more morning duties for her. Or he could encourage her to sleep during the day.\nVoice 1 \nBut even if a pregnant woman is sleeping more, she still needs to stay active and exercise if she can! This is the sixth tip for a healthy pregnancy. Exercise is good for most people. This is true for pregnant woman as well. It is important that women talk to their doctor before beginning any exercise program. Staying physically strong during the pregnancy can also help with the birth and recovery.\nVoice 2 \nThe final tip for a healthy pregnancy is to think about a plan for the birth of the baby. Labor is usually painful and can be frightening. Thinking about what the birth might be like can give a woman some control over what is happening. She can make a plan for how she would like things to go or about who she would like to be there.\nVoice 1 \nPeople cannot always control if there is a healthy birth or not. But there are things that women can do to have the most healthy pregnancy possible. And there are things their partners can do to encourage them in this work. A healthy pregnancy sets up a healthy baby. And a healthy baby can mean a healthy life.\nImage by Brian Odwar from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nWill you have to change anything if you become pregnant?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nThink about a food you HATED as a child. You never wanted to eat it because it tasted terrible! But, when you grew up, you tried that food again. This time, you LOVED it! What changed? Why did the food taste so good when you were older? The answer to this question may be on the tip of your tongue. Today’s Spotlight is on the amazing human tongue.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nSee the Advanced version of this program here.\nVoice 2 \nThe tongue is a muscle. It is like the muscles that move your arms or legs. However, the tongue is different in a big way. The tongue is not connected to any bones. It is a group of eight muscles that work together. This is what makes the tongue able to move and change shapes.\nVoice 1 \nThe tongue’s flexiblity and movement help with eating, drinking, talking and singing. But it is the surface of the tongue that helps with taste. The tongue has taste receptors located all across its top. Many people believe that the surface of the tongue has different areas to taste different things. This is not exactly true. Erich Voigt is a doctor at NYU Langone Medical Center. He told the website MentalFloss.com,\nVoice 3 \n“Taste receptors are concentrated on the tip of your tongue – the front point. They are also along the sides and at the back. The middle of the tongue has the least taste ability. The idea that the tongue has different taste areas is a myth. There is no tongue map with different parts for different tastes. That idea is wrong. All taste areas are able to sense the five kinds of taste. These are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory.”\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSo the tongue is a group of muscles that lets people taste different foods. But what is taste? And why do people taste things differently?\nVoice 1 \nFor a long time, scientists thought there were four basic tastes. The first is salty. Salty foods are foods like french fries, soy sauce, olives, and chips. The next is sour foods. Sour foods are foods like lemons or yogurt. The third taste is sweet. Sweet foods are fruits, breads, and candy. The fourth taste is bitter. Bitter foods are foods like coffee, dark chocolate, and some spices.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, all people know that there are more than five tastes. And as science has advanced more tastes have been identified. Umami is the flavor of cooked meat. It is also sometimes called savory. Astringent foods make your mouth tighten. Pungent foods have a strong smell, such as mustard or ginger. These tastes were always part of foods. But people now use a new clearer way to talk about them.\nVoice 1 \nEvery tongue is able to taste all of these things. However, every tongue tastes each kind of food at a different level. Some people may not like the taste of a sour lemon. Their tongue may be very sensitive to sour foods. So the sour lemon is too much taste for them to enjoy. Other people may love coffee. They may NOT be very sensitive to bitter foods. So the bitter taste of coffee is a perfect balance. What you like to eat is based on your tongue. You may never be able to make someone love a food that you love. If someone does not like the taste of fish, it will not matter how much they try it. Their tongue may not let them enjoy it.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, people should still try new foods often! The human tongue changes over time. As people get older, the tongue becomes less able to taste foods. This means that people could begin to like foods with more spice. Food they did not like as a child begins to taste great. Another reason for food tastes changing is that people also become less able to smell. Smell is a big part of eating. It influences how we react to foods.\nVoice 1 \nEach person’s tongue combines genetics and culture. Your tongue tastes foods because of your parents’ genes. You also have the food experiences you have because of the culture of your childhood. Veronique Greenwood wrote about why different cultures value different tasting foods for the BBC.com. She says that food tastes can make people remember home. She writes,\nVoice 4 \n‘The combination of tomato, garlic, oregano, and olive oil feels Italian. Food with dried shrimp, chili peppers, ginger, and palm oil feels Brazilian. For Germans, it is dill, sour cream, mustard, vinegar and black pepper. Chinese food uses soy sauce, rice wine, and ginger. Those tastes seem to describe a taste that most people from that culture enjoy eating.”\nImage by S K from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nOne of the joys of travel is getting to try new foods. Each new place offers a new taste. But not every taste will be good to every person. Yet it is good to try new foods. Natalie Jesionka is a writer and teacher. She wrote about eating new foods for the Muse.com.\nVoice 5 \n“No matter how frightening a new food may seem, it is better to try it and experience it yourself. If it tastes great then you will have a new favorite food. If it tastes very bad? Well, then you will have a good travel story to share when you get home.”\nVoice 1 \nDo you like to try new foods?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Nick Page.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Christy VanArragon. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nImagine that you are sick. You go to see a doctor. Your doctor gives you some drugs. He tells you that they will make you better. You take the drugs and you do start to feel better. But later, the doctor tells you that it is not the drugs that have helped you. The drugs were just a sugar substance. The doctor explains that your improved health was from the placebo effect. Today’s Spotlight is on the placebo effect.\nVoice 2 \n“Placebo” is a Latin word, used in English. It means, “I shall please.” The placebo effect is when a suggestion or belief that something is helpful actually makes it become helpful. For example, just the act of taking a medicine can improve a person’s health! The mind works to heal the body.\nVoice 1 \nScientists sometimes use placebos to test the effect of drugs, or medicines. They perform controlled experiments. They give one group of people the real medicine. They give another group of people a ‘placebo’ medicine. The placebo looks exactly like the medicine but it is not. It does not contain any healing elements. The people do not know which medicine they are taking – the real one or the placebo. The medicine has to produce better results than the placebo to prove that it is effective.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, sometimes the people taking the placebo experience improvements in their health. The false drug produces an effect – even though it is not supposed to! Scientists call this the ‘placebo effect.’\nImage by Pexels from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nResearchers have studied the placebo effect for many years. There is great interest about the subject. And there are still many unanswered questions. Why is a placebo effective? Mostly, researchers have looked at the placebo effect in terms of physical health. However, a research team in Sweden has produced some interesting findings about the emotional effects of placebos.\nVoice 2 \nThe team performed a series of experiments. First the researchers showed a group of people unpleasant pictures, like images of dead bodies. The people rated how they felt after seeing the pictures. They gave the highest number to the pictures that gave them the worst feelings. The researchers then gave the people a calming drug. They told the people that the calming drug would reduce the unpleasant feelings from the pictures. When the team showed the pictures again, the people said that they felt much calmer.\nVoice 1 \nThe following day, the researchers gave the people unpleasant images to look at again. Then, they gave them drugs. However, this time they gave them a placebo instead of the calming drug. The placebo was nothing but salt and water. But the people did not know this.\nVoice 2 \nAfter taking the placebo, the people’s ratings still changed. Their unpleasant feelings reduced by almost 30%. It seems that taking the placebo made them feel calmer. During the experiment scientists also used special equipment to look at, or ‘scan’ the brain. They wanted to see if there was a change in the way the brains’ emotional centres were behaving. The scans showed that the brains’ emotional centres were more rested after the people took the placebo. The scientists claim that this is important new evidence. It means that placebos may reduce emotional pain. Dr Predrag Petrovic managed the experiment. He told the BBC:\nVoice 3 \n‘The placebo changes what we expect. When we expect that something unpleasant should become less unpleasant, it really does.’\nVoice 1 \nSo does that mean that doctors could use placebos to treat worry or anxiety? Dr. Petrovic said that this is not likely to happen. It would mean that doctors would have to lie to their patients. Dylan Evans teaches at a specialist university in England. He has written books about the placebo effect. He said:\nVoice 4 \n‘Doctors have a duty to care for their patients. But they also have a duty to tell the truth. Placebos seem to pull these two duties in opposite directions.’\nPhoto by Anna Shvets from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nThe placebo effect may be real, but it cannot replace medicine. If a doctor lies to his patient it may have a bad effect on their relationship. And many researchers believe that a good relationship alone can help the healing process. Studies show that support and reassurance can improve health. A good patient-doctor relationship is healing. But this is nothing new. Hippocrates was a great physician, or doctor. He lived in ancient Greece. More than 2,000 years ago, he wrote:\nVoice 5 \n’..the patient, though knowing that his condition is terrible, may recover his health simply through being satisfied with the goodness of the doctor.’\nVoice 1 \nThe mind can affect the body in good ways. But it can also produce bad effects. Some people describe the nocebo effect as ‘placebo’s evil brother.’ Placebo means, ‘I will please.’ Nocebo means, ‘I will harm.’ A nocebo effect is when a suggestion or belief that something is harmful actually makes it become harmful. For example, some people feel nervous before a test. The nervous feeling gives them pains in their stomach – it can even produce physical sickness.\nVoice 2 \nScientists and doctors are studying the relationship between the mind and the body very closely. It is important work. If doctors can understand how one influences the other, they may be able to help patients more effectively. Increasingly, people are looking at ways of treating the ‘whole person’- not just the body.\nVoice 1 \nCould it be that modern doctors have centred too much on treating the physical body? Developments in modern medicine are happening very quickly. For some people a trip to the doctor has become a quick fix. They have a pain in the head – so they take medicine. They treat the symptom – the physical pain. But are they in danger of never treating the causes?\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nBernard Palmer is a doctor and a Christian. He believes that people have physical, mental and spiritual needs. And he says that effective treatment recognises the needs of the ‘whole person.’ Many people have physical problems that are made worse by their mental state. And some people have deep spiritual needs – which only God can meet. Dr. Palmer says that God is concerned with our bodies, minds and spirits – and that we should be too. So maybe the placebo effect is not so surprising after all. It is simply meeting a need that is not physical. It seems that the human body is far more complex than we understand.\nVoice 1 \nThe writers of this program were Marina Santee and Elizabeth Lickiss. The producer was Nick Mangeolles.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nCamila and Henrique were young and in love. But one day Camila discovered something surprising. Henrique had been born with the HIV virus, which attacks the body’s immune system. Many of their friends and family did not want Camila to stay with Henrique. But she remained in a relationship with him. Together they faced discrimination because of Henrique’s HIV positive status.\nVoice 2  \nThousands of people in Brazil and around the world watched this relationship. Camila and Henrique were characters on a Portuguese language television program in 2015. Malhação-Seu Lugar No Mundo is a well-known Brazilian TV program. Camila and Henrique were very popular characters. But they also addressed a very important issue in Brazil and around the world. Today’s Spotlight is on the latest global situation of HIV/AIDS. What is happening with this very important issue?\nVoice 1  \nHIV/AIDS has been a major world issue since the 1980s. The World Health Organization says that since that time, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV. About 35 million have died of HIV. Thirty years ago there was a lot of bad or false information about HIV/AIDS. But most people today know much more about the disease. They know that they cannot get HIV from just touching someone. The virus does not pass through sweat, saliva or urine. This improved information helps people react to the disease in a better way. So what is happening with HIV/AIDS in our world now?\nVoice 2  \nThere have been both positive and negative changes for HIV/AIDS. Here is the good news! The total number of people infected with HIV is going down. People know more about how to avoid HIV infection.\nVoice 1  \nIn some parts of the world, rates of HIV/AIDS have decreased a lot. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world. But in East and South African countries, the number of people with HIV/AIDS has gone down by nearly 30 percent since 2010. Botswana’s Health Minister Dorcas Makgato tells Al Jazeera how her country made this happen:\nVoice 3  \n“Right from the beginning we decided to come to the issue boldly. We were very open about the size of the problem and did not try to hide from it. We were bold in the sense that we admitted that there was a problem. We were bold in bringing everyone involved together. We had a common purpose in fighting HIV and AIDS.”\nVoice 2  \nBotswana still has a high rate of HIV at 21 percent. But this has dropped from 36 percent in the year 2000. Botswana has a government program that treats EVERY person no matter their age, sex or economic status. And they have seen particular improvement in one area: passing of HIV from mothers to their babies. The rate in Botswana has dropped from 40 to less than two percent! Many other countries have a similar drop in mother to child transmission. This is one of the major successes against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.\nVoice 1  \nMany people with HIV/AIDS are also living longer. People with HIV/AIDS can take drugs to control the virus. These drugs are called Antiretrovirals or ARVs. By using ARVs correctly, people with HIV/AIDS can live long, productive lives. UNAIDS is the United Nations’ global effort to end AIDS. In a report, they said that for the first time, 53 percent of the people who need ARVs are able to get them. This is more than twice the number of people who were able to get them in 2012.\nVoice 2  \nBut not all of the developments with HIV/AIDS are good. In some parts of world, cases of HIV/AIDS are even going up. NPR reports that new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia have increased by 60 percent. Most of the cases of HIV/AIDs in countries like Russia and Ukraine are in particular parts of the population. HIV/AIDS is most commonly spread in this area by injecting illegal drugs.\nVoice 1  \nBut there are people at risk and vulnerable in every country, even wealthier ones. Some people have fewer resources and less social power. The most vulnerable people include women, migrant workers, sex workers and people living in conflict areas. Vulnerable people have less control over their own safety. They also have less access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment.\nVoice 2  \nAnd even after 30 years, there is still lot of stigma around HIV/AIDS. People do not want to talk about it – it seems shameful. The issues around HIV/AIDS are very complex. This shows why the disease is so difficult to deal with. Michel Sidibé is the Executive Director of UNAIDS. He spoke to the Global HIV Prevention Coalition:\nVoice 4  \n“We must boldly face the structural barriers and basic causes of vulnerabilities. This is what makes prevention so difficult. Unless we address the basic causes of new HIV/AIDS infections, no big change will come. If it was easy, we would have done it by now.”\nVoice 1  \nSo there are many challenges for people living with HIV/AIDS. But there is also a lot of hope for the future. Researchers continue working to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. We do not know when a cure will be available. But we do know that people living with HIV/AIDS are surviving later into life.\nVoice 2  \nHIV/AIDS is a very real part of life in every country in the world. We are not all doctors, but everyone can work to fight HIV/AIDS. We can look for true information and share it with other people. You can find links to information on the script page of this program. People can also help decrease stigma. We can care for the people around us, no matter what their status is. As Michel Sidibé says:\nVoice 4  \n“We need every single part of society to join us on this journey. We have a road map to show the way, and we know the barriers in our path. Discrimination that limits people’s access to life-saving information and medicines must be removed. These services belong to everyone, whoever they are, wherever they live, whoever they love.”\nVoice 1  \nDo you have true information about HIV/AIDS?

It is not cancer or heart disease or malaria. It is tooth decay, or dental caries or cavities. Half of the world’s population has problems with their teeth. The doctors and experts who treat these issues are dentists. Dr. Wagner Marcenes is a professor of Dentistry at the University of London. He is part of an international research team. They study tooth, or dental, health around the world. In a study from 2010, he explained how big this issue is:\nVoice 3 \n“There are close to four billion people in the world who suffer from untreated problems with their teeth. These problems cause tooth pain. They prevent people from eating and possibly sleeping properly. … We are facing serious problems in the population’s mouth health.”\nVoice 2 \nDental caries are a very painful and unpleasant problem. But one main reason for them is sweet. It is eating sugar and sugary food. Eating sugary food is bad for teeth. But sugary food is becoming more popular around the world. So, how can people prevent these tooth problems? Today’s Spotlight is on your teeth and sugar.\nPhoto by Glen Carrie\nVoice 1 \nMost adult humans have 32 teeth. Teeth help our faces keep their correct shape. They help us communicate through talking or smiling. And of course, they help us eat food. Everything we eat and drink passes through our mouths. The Mayo Clinic calls teeth the ‘window to your overall health’. They explain on their website:\nVoice 4 \n“Did you know that the health of your mouth offers clues about your overall health? Did you know that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body? Like other areas of the body, your mouth is filled with bacteria. Most of it is harmless. But your mouth is the entry point to your body systems. Some of these bacteria can cause disease. Your oral, or mouth, health may add to other diseases and conditions, including problems with your heart, lungs or difficulties during pregnancy.”\nVoice 2 \nSo how do we keep our mouths healthy? What we eat and drink has a great effect on our whole body. And it has particular results on the health of our teeth. One way to see these results is to look at what humans have eaten over many years. As our diet has changed – our dental health has changed too. Middle income countries have the highest level of tooth decay in the world. But levels of tooth decay in lower income countries are increasing quickly. Habib Benzian is the director of global health and policy at New York University’s College of Dentistry. He explains to NPR how diet changes affect people’s teeth:\nVoice 5 \n“Low-income countries usually have traditional diets. They eat more plant and meat-based foods. They eat less sugar and processed foods. But each country’s social and economic conditions change. As that happens, there is a change in what people eat. It is a part of convenience. If you work all day and come home, you want quick food. Fast foods are fried, high in fat, sweet — and very cheap.”\nPhoto by Felix Zhao\nVoice 1 \nEating a lot of sugar is one of the most unhealthy things you can do. The World Dental Federation says eating and drinking sugar is the main cause of tooth decay. And globally, people are eating and drinking more and more sugar. The World Health Organization suggests each person should eat and drink less than 25 grams of sugar a day. But in many countries the average person eats and drinks much more than that. In some countries the average person eats two, three, or even four times more than that!\nVoice 2 \nAs a result, there are a lot of ideas about how to reduce the amount of sugar people eat and drink. One idea is to put higher tax on sugary foods and drinks. Another idea is a legal limit on the amount of sugar in foods for babies and children. Another idea is to stop selling sugary products to young people and children.\nVoice 1 \nSugar is a big part of one of the largest health crises in the world. But sugar is also one of the most important agricultural industries in the world. Many people make money from this industry. They do not want to sell less sugar. This makes dental health a complex global issue.\nVoice 2 \nSugar is only one thing that affects people’s dental health. A person’s dental health depends on many things. An individual can usually make their own decisions about diet and hygiene, such as tooth brushing. But people cannot always control their economic situation. They cannot always control how much money they have or where they live. They cannot control their access to dental care. The effect of dental decay is much worse in very poor populations. This is true even in wealthy countries.\nVoice 1 \nThere are many large systems that affect people’s teeth. These problems can seem too big to solve. But the World Dental Federation says we can improve people’s teeth around the world. In their document, “The Challenge of Oral Disease” they give ideas of what groups can do to help on different levels. They think that everyone around the world should be able to pay for good ways to prevent tooth problems, such as treatment with fluoride – a mineral that protects teeth. They also think everyone should have health care that will help them pay to see a doctor for their teeth when they need to.\nPhoto by H Shaw\nVoice 2 \nThe World Dental Federation thinks that caring for our teeth and mouths should be connected to caring for the rest of our bodies. Strong, healthy teeth are important for the health of our whole body and sense of well-being. Most people cannot change the global dental system. But they do have some control over how well they take care of their teeth. And one easy thing everyone can do to take better care of their teeth is reduce how much sugar they eat.\nVoice 1 \nDo you eat or drink a lot of sugar? Do you have any teeth problems?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nImagine waking up from sleep. But you do not know where you are. You have never seen this room before. You do not remember how you got here. It looks like a hospital room. A woman comes in. She is friendly. She seems to know you. But you have never met her before. She tries to give you medicine. You begin to get angry. Where are you? Why are you here? Where is your home, your family, your children? The woman will not tell you anything.\nVoice 2  \nThis is an experience of a person with dementia. It can be difficult to care for people with dementia. But more and more people around the world are living longer. More people have a form of dementia every day. Some health experts even call it a global health crisis. New methods can help people with dementia live good lives. But are they moral? Today’s Spotlight is on dementia and its care.\nVoice 1  \nDementia is a disease of the brain. It mostly affects older people. There is no single cause for dementia. And doctors do not know how to cure it. But they do know that it causes the brain to shrink. The mind stops working well. Dementia can be mild or severe. But all forms of dementia make it difficult to make new memories. Many dementia patients get confused very easily. They are unable to think clearly. People with dementia cannot always understand what is real or not.\nPhoto by Hermes Rivera\nVoice 2\nMost dementia patients cannot survive without care. But care can be very different from place to place. There is not one accepted way to treat dementia. In some countries, people do not even recognize dementia as a disease. It is just another part of getting old. In many places, families care for older family members with dementia at home. But this can very difficult. Many dementia patients become angry and resist care.\nVoice 1  \nBut some people are not able to care for family members with dementia. Some families put their older family members into special hospitals. These are called nursing homes. In a nursing home, dementia patients receive special care. But they are also away from everything they have ever known. It can be a painful, lonely experience.\nVoice 2  \nYvonne van Amerongen did not like either of these choices for care. She is from the Netherlands. She helped create a new and different place for people with dementia. When she was younger, Van Amerongen worked at a nursing home. Many of her patients had dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia. Van Amerongen saw how traditional treatment was very difficult for patients with dementia. They did not seem to be able to live happy lives. Van Amerongen felt that there had to be a better way. In 2013 she told the news organization CNN:\nVoice 3  \n“It was when my mother called me, and told me my father had died suddenly. Nothing was wrong with him. He just had a heart attack and he died. One of the first things I thought was ‘Thank God he never had to be in a nursing home.’ That is crazy that I have to think that! I manage a nursing home, and I do not want my father to come here.”\nVoice 1  \nVan Amerongen found other care experts who felt the same way. They decided that the problem with nursing homes was not in the care. Instead, it was in the homes themselves. Together, they designed a new place for treating dementia. They called this place Hogewey.\nVoice 2  \nHogewey is different than a hospital. It is a village where people with severe dementia can live normal lives. People live together in houses. The patients have friends and neighbors. There is a town square, a theatre, a garden, and a post office. People with dementia often get lost. But patients in Hogewey can go anywhere they want. It is completely safe for them. Cameras also watch the patients there. Care givers and doctors in this village look like normal people. They wear normal clothes so they do not worry the patients.\nPhoto by Andreea Popa\nVoice 1  \nHogewey opened in 2009. Today, it is one of the most celebrated dementia treatment centres in the world. In 2013, CNN reported that the patients in Hogeway live longer. They need fewer medicines. And they seem as if they enjoy life.\nVoice 2  \nMany villages like Hogeway have opened in Japan, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the USA. Each village looks different. That is because each dementia patient comes from a different culture. But to the patient, these villages feel like home. Marjolein de Visser is a social worker at Hogewey. In 2013, she told CNN,\nVoice 4  \n“In here, people can be themselves. They can be human. They are not just people with dementia. They are just people. And they can do what they like.”\nVoice 1  \nSome people say that these dementia villages are the future of dementia care. But dementia villages are not perfect. They cost a lot of money. And dementia villages do not have rooms for very many people. There are also people who think Hogewey is fooling dementia patients. This village is not a real village. It may even be a lie. Julian Hughes is a scientist that discusses medical ethics. He helps decide if some ways of care are moral or not. In a 2009 report from Nuffield health, he said\nVoice 5  \n“It is troubling when a village like this, or parts of it, are not honest. Patients who know something is not right could become upset. Or stop trusting caregivers.”\nVoice 2  \nPeople like Hughes believe that Hogewey dementia patients cannot be in real society where they are. People watch them all of the time. And their care givers hide the truth. But Van Amerongen believes that Hogewey is not like this. Patients there are happy. She says no one in Hogewey is acting and there is no lie. She believes that dementia villages provide the best care in a difficult situation.\nVoice 1  \nWhat do you think? Are places like Hogewey lying to their patients? Is the care they receive worth more than the truth? You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA man and a woman are in bed. The man is sleeping. He went to sleep as soon as he got into bed. He snores loudly. He has no difficulty falling asleep. And he always sleeps well all night. The woman lies next to him. But she is not sleeping. She feels tired but she cannot sleep. She lies on her back. She turns and lies on her side. Then she turns to her other side. Still she cannot sleep. And still he sleeps – and snores! He always sleeps well at night. And she always finds it difficult to go to sleep.\nVoice 2  \nMany people experience problems with sleep. Some people find it difficult to go to sleep. Some find that they are often awake in the middle of the night. Some people even take medicine to make them go to sleep. Sleep is important for everyone. And better sleep improves people’s minds and bodies. Today’s Spotlight is on a good night’s sleep.\nVoice 1  \nAll humans have a basic need to sleep. And we normally sleep at night. Our bodies have a kind of clock in them that is linked to daylight. When it gets dark, our bodies prepare for sleep. And scientists have discovered that our bodies change during sleep. Our heart rate and body temperature both drop. Our brain waves change too.\nVoice 2  \nWe experience about five different cycles or periods of sleep each night. Each cycle lasts about an hour and a half. In each sleep cycle we experience different sorts of sleep. Non REM and REM are the main sorts of sleep. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. In non REM sleep our eyes do not move much. But in REM sleep our eyes move quickly. We also dream most during REM sleep.\nPhoto by Adi Goldstein\nVoice 1  \nBut how much sleep do people need? An average adult needs about seven or eight hours of sleep every night. But everyone is a little different. Some people need more sleep. Some people need less. Scientists have discovered that our genes can affect how much we need to sleep. About ten percent of people need nine or ten hours of sleep. Other people are fine with three to six hours of sleep.\nVoice 2  \nIf people do not get enough sleep they can suffer both physically and mentally. They may feel tired and angry or annoyed. They cannot remember things or solve problems as easily. They can make mistakes in their work. Sleep is also important for a person’s health. Lack of sleep can make people sick, and increase the risk of heart disease or stroke. In extreme cases people, can even die because of a total lack of sleep.\nVoice 1  \nDifferent cultures have different sleep traditions. In some cultures it is normal to sleep alone or with a husband or wife. But in other cultures people sleep with their family or even in big social or community groups. In Spain, people have a tradition of a siesta or short sleep in the afternoon. People in Egypt also have an afternoon sleep called Ta’assila. Some tribes in Botswana and Zaire sleep when they feel like it – at any time of the day or night. People who live in Japan sleep less at night than people in many other countries. But the Japanese have developed a tradition of sleeping at work. They take very short sleeps or naps called inemuri.\nVoice 2  \nHistory can also teach us about sleep traditions. Roger Ekirch is an historian at Virginia Tech in the United States. He researched how people slept in the past. He examined hundreds of old documents. And he discovered that people used to sleep in a different way from most people today.\nVoice 1  \nIn the past, people slept in two separate periods during the night. They called the two periods of sleep ‘first sleep’ and ‘second sleep’. Between these two sleeps they were awake for one or two hours. Ekirch believes that this way of sleeping started to change when people began using street lights and lights in homes. Lights caused people to stay up late. They no longer had time for two sleeps.\nVoice 2  \nPeople forgot about ‘first sleep’ and ‘second sleep’. But some people still have a period of being awake in the middle of the night. They can think that they have a sleep problem. But experts like Ekirch think that this may just be a natural way to sleep. Ekirch told the Huffington post,\nVoice 3  \n‘People who suffer from middle of the night sleeplessness should understand something. Seen from history, their sleep may well be completely normal.’\nVoice 1  \nSo it may be frustrating, but if you wake in the night you may not have a sleep problem! You may just sleep more like your ancestors.\nPhoto by Matthew T Rader\nVoice 2  \nThere are many other common sleep problems. Experts say that there are many reasons for poor sleep. But they also advise how to create good conditions for sleep. They say you should make sure that the place where you are sleeping is dark. Melatonin is a chemical produced by the body. This chemical helps control sleep. Melatonin reacts with light. That is why people find it much harder to go to sleep in a light room. The blue light from modern technology is a particular problem. Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard told the BBC,\nVoice 4  \n‘Light most powerfully influences your body clock. Being near light, especially short wave length blue-ish light at night, will reset our body clock to a later hour. This will delay the release of the sleep encouraging chemical melatonin. This will make it more difficult for us to get up in the morning.’\nVoice 1  \nExperts also say you should make sure that where you sleep is not too hot or cold. Your body has a natural drop in temperature when you go to sleep. So if you move from a warm room to a cool room to sleep you will help that natural process. You should prepare for bedtime and create a calm atmosphere. With a good night’s sleep you can have a good day!\nVoice 2  \nDo you sleep well at night? Or do you have sleep problems?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nSometimes people and objects from different parts of the world become connected in unexpected ways.\nVoice 2  \nDo you know how the following things are connected?\nVoice 1  \nFive hundred people from Eritrea and Somalia in Africa.\nVoice 2  \nA boat.\nVoice 1 \nA carpenter or wood worker from Italy.\nVoice 2 \nA radio.\nVoice 1 \nThe world-famous British Museum in the United Kingdom.\nVoice 2 \nThey are all linked by a small cross made from wood. Today’s Spotlight is on that small wooden cross – the Lampedusa Cross.\nVoice 1 \nOne night in October 2013 a boat was on the Mediterranean Sea. The wooden boat was too full. Over 500 men, women and children were on it. They were refugees from Eritrea and Somalia in Africa. They had escaped from the dangers of war, poverty, or oppression. And they were looking for freedom, safety, and a new life in Europe.\nVoice 2 \nThe refugees were tired. Many were sleeping. The people who were awake saw lights in the far distance. Land! But then something terrible happened. Fire! Everyone was very frightened. They screamed and cried loudly. Then the boat started to sink. Some people fell into the sea. One refugee, Selomun, later told the Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n“I was woken by people screaming. I had three or four seconds to react as the boat rolled over. Most people slid out of the boat and fell in the water, but I held on.”\nVoice 1  \nThen the boat sank under the water. Many of the refugees drowned. The others waited in the sea for rescue. Hours later some of them were saved by boats from the island of Lampedusa near Sicily, in Italy. Fanus was rescued. She told the Guardian about her experience,\nVoice 4  \n“They were the longest hours of my life. The rescuers saw my hands moving in the water, but my head was almost under.”\nVoice 2  \nOnly 151 people survived. The rescuers took them to Lampedusa. Francesco Tuccio lived there. He did not know the refugees. But he saw their suffering. He saw them crying for friends and family who had drowned. He told Refugee Stories Network what he saw.\nVoice 5  \n“I saw suffering. I even felt it with my own hands. I saw many dead people. Dead children. I held dead children. It was horrible.”\nVoice 1  \nTuccio wanted to do something for these refugees. He was a carpenter. So he used his skill with wood to do something special. He found wood from their wrecked boat. He thought the wood smelled of salt, the sea and even suffering. Tuccio knew the refugees were Christian believers. So from this wood he made each refugee a Christian symbol of hope. He made each of them a small wooden cross to wear.\nVoice 2  \nIn the next few years many other people tried to get to Europe by travelling across the Mediterranean Sea. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that over 1,000,000 people arrived in Europe by sea in 2015. But many boats were wrecked in the sea. More than 3,700 migrants died.\nVoice 1  \nDuring this time, Tuccio continued to make crosses for more refugees. He believed it was his duty as a man of faith to ease the suffering of those who survived. He also wanted more people to understand what was happening. And so he made larger crosses for many churches in Italy. In 2015, the BBC talked to him for a radio programme. Tuccio told them that he wanted to honour both those who died and those who survived. He explained,\nVoice 5  \n“Every time I make a cross I feel like I am saving a person. And for those migrants who made it to land, I want the cross to represent a new starting point. The cross is a symbol of re-birth and rescue and I want these people to have a better life.”\nVoice 2  \nIn the United Kingdom, Jill Cook heard the radio programme. Cook works at the British Museum in London. This famous museum stores and shows objects of permanent value to world history and culture. Cook was moved by Tuccio’s kindness. But she was also excited. A cross made by Tuccio could represent ALL the refugees who had travelled to Europe during this period in history. It could tell their story. She explained to the BBC why an object is important for the museum,\nVoice 6  \n“We do not show photographs or images at the museum. We only show objects. And so the migrants, who have nothing, were always going to be unseen. And then I heard about the carpenter and his crosses.”\nVoice 1  \nCook asked Tuccio to make a cross for the museum. He was happy and proud to do this. He knew that people from all over the world visit the British Museum. He later told the BBC,\nVoice 5  \n“I would like future generations to remember when they look at the wood that it is made from suffering. And I would like them to remember that the cross is the symbol of freedom and the coming together of people.”\nVoice 2  \nTuccio made the cross for the museum from wood from the boat that was wrecked in October, 2013. Cook remembers that everyone at the Museum went quiet when they saw the cross. Neil MacGregor was in charge of the Museum. He decided that the simple wooden cross was a very special object. He said,\nVoice 7  \n“This simple, yet moving, object is a special gift to the collection. Mr Tuccio’s kindness will allow all visitors to the Museum to consider this important time in the history of Europe. It is a great migration which may change the way we understand our continent. In my time at the Museum we have collected many wonderful objects. All of them have tried to shine a light on the needs and hopes that all humans share.”\nVoice 1  \nCook still feels strong emotion when she looks at the Lampedusa Cross. Tears come to her eyes. Many visitors to the museum react in the same way. The cross is only about 38 centimetres high. And the blue, green and yellow paint on the wood is damaged. But it is a powerful symbol of both suffering and hope in our time. One visitor told the BBC,\nVoice 8  \n‘I think the symbolism of it is amazing. For a symbol of hope to be made from the wreckage it is beautiful.’\nVoice 2  \nBut the Lampedusa cross is more than a memory of the past. Refugees still sail across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe. This is still dangerous. And thousands die in the sea every year.\nVoice 1  \nThe writer of this programme was Katy Blake.

She is cold and hungry. Where can she find help on a cold winter’s day?\nVoice 2\n“Matches! Light your fires with my matches! Would you like to buy some matches sir? What about you madam? They are the best kind! Strike them against any wall! They will burn! Someone must want some matches – anyone?”\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story. Hans Christian Anderson wrote this story. He wrote many children’s stories in the 1800s. People like to tell the story of the Little Match Girl during the Christmas season. Both adults and children enjoy it. But is it a sad story or a happy story? Liz Waid tells the story of the Little Match Girl.\nVoice 3\nA cold wind blows across the town. People hurry along, holding their warm coats close to their bodies. It is a cold winter! They will be happy to get home to their warm fires and nice food. Street sellers count their money at the end of the day. But for the little match girl, there is no money to count. No one wants to buy her matches. So, she is afraid to go home. Her father will beat her for sure.\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nThe little girl walks across the street. The snow falls on her long hair. She looks up at the tall, beautiful houses as she passes. She can hear people laughing inside. The smell of food cooking rises in the air. The people are preparing their last meal before the New Year. The little match girl walks to a quiet street corner. She sits down, holding her knees. She tries to pull her feet under her body. They are so cold. She has no shoes or coat. Her feet are blue from walking on the cold ground. Maybe she should go home? But even her home is not warm. Her family has no money.\nThe little girl puts her head in her hands. A tear wets the side of her face. If only she could be warm – for just a minute. Then, she has an idea – matches! She has her matches!\nHer father would be angry if she wasted any matches. But she only wants one, just one. Maybe it will warm her freezing fingers. The little girl gets a match. She strikes it against the wall – fire! The warm orange light shines in the darkness. The little girl looks hard at the small dancing fire. She imagines that she is sitting by a warm cooking oven. It seems so real! She can see the oven. She can feel its heat. She stretches her legs and warms her feet. How the fire burns! Then, the fire from the match goes out. The oven disappears. The little girl is once again in the cold darkness. Only the half-burnt match remains in her hand.\nThe little girl is so sad. Her happiness had come and gone so quickly. Maybe she could burn one more match? She takes another. And she strikes it against the wall. Fire lights up her sad face. She smiles. This time, she sees the wall become thin. It is almost like paper. She can see through it! Behind it, she sees a room. Such beauty! There is a huge table with hot food on it! She can almost taste the hot food. She reaches out for a little to feed her hungry stomach. But suddenly the fire from the match goes out. Once more, everything disappears. Only the grey wall remains before her.\nSo, the little girl strikes another match. The golden fire burns again. This time, she is under a huge Christmas tree! Beautiful bells and flowers hang from the tree. Lights shine from its green branches. It is the most beautiful tree she has ever seen! She reaches her hands toward the lights. Then, the match goes out. But the Christmas lights begin to change into stars in the sky. One of the stars falls back to earth.\nThe little girl thinks to herself,\nVoice 2\n“Someone must be dying”.\nVoice 3\nThe little girl starts to think of her dead grandmother. Her grandmother told her that when a star falls from the sky, a soul goes up to God. She misses her grandmother so much. The little girl lights another match.\nThis time, standing in the light, she sees her grandmother! Her grandmother was the only person who ever showed her love. She looks beautiful. The little girl cries:\nVoice 2\n‘Grandmother! Take me with you! I know when the fire goes out you will disappear! Please take me with you!’\nHinko Smrekar, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 3\nThe little girl takes all the matches. One by one she strikes them against the wall. She burns them quickly, so the picture does not disappear. The light shines brighter and brighter. It is as bright as day. She sees her grandmother more clearly. Her grandmother has never been so beautiful. The little girl reaches out to her grandmother. Her grandmother stretches out her arms to receive the little girl.\nThe grandmother takes the little girl in her arms. They fly together in joy high above the earth. There is no cold, hunger or fear. They are with God.\nIn the corner on the street, the little girl is leaning against the wall. She has red cheeks and a smiling mouth. But she is frozen. The New Year’s sun rises on the sad figure. The child sits there still and cold. She is holding a bundle of half-burned matches.\nOnly a few people walk on the quiet streets. They stop at the street corner. They see a small body on the ground. The people comment, “Poor thing. She was trying to keep warm,”\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nBut no one knew the beautiful things she had seen. They did not know how happy she was to be with her grandmother. She had gone happily into the New Year.\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story at Christmas time. It is an imaginary story. But people see many messages in it. Some people say the little match girl makes them think about people who have less than them. They think about people who may be poor or lonely at Christmas or the holidays. The story encourages them to help people in need.\nOther people see a message behind the pictures in the story. Each vision made the little match girl feel happy. But the picture she wanted to stay with her was the one of her grandmother. This was the only one that offered a different kind of happiness – love.\nUnconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God’s love and heaven – especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day — heaven.\nHave you heard this story before? Do you think this story was a sad story or a happy story?

Are they lies or truth?\nVoice 2 \nHumans only use ten percent of their brains.\nVoice 1 \nDid you know that if you are in the UK and you dial 999 and hang up, it will charge your mobile telephone?\nVoice 2 \nThere is a small amount of drugs found on every American dollar bill.\nVoice 1 \nSwimming after eating will cause a pain in your stomach and you will die.\nVoice 2 \nHas anyone ever told you a story like this that sounded false, but could have been true? Probably that person was telling you an urban legend — like the ones we just told. Urban legends are stories that many people tell. They are often connected to city, or urban, life. They are stories that sound so strange that it is difficult to believe they are true. But they are stories that could be true – so we want to believe them. Most people will share these stories to many people.\nStories spread from person to person very quickly; Image by Gordon Johnson from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nUrban legend stories spread quickly. They pass by word of mouth from person to person. People tell them over and over again. And they are told over many years. Today, they are spread through social media. When you hear an urban legend, the story usually starts something like this, “A friend of a friend of mine told me this story …”\nVoice 2 \nUrban legends are never first-hand stories. That is, the person telling you the story was not there. He did not experience the events of the story himself. He is only telling you what he heard from someone else. Some urban legends last many years, and there is no way to know if they are true!\nVoice 1 \nSo, what urban legends have you heard or seen? Have you heard that restaurants use worms, a kind of insect, to make their hamburgers? Or how about this? Did you hear that every human will eat eight insects a year in their sleep? If you sleep with your mouth open, these horrible little creatures can walk right into your mouth and down into your stomach! What do you think about that? How many insects do you think you have eaten this year?\nVoice 2 \nSome social scientists study urban legends. They say that these stories show what a community is concerned about. For example, urban legends about crime show that a community is concerned about crime. Stories about abuse or corruption show that a community is concerned about honesty in the police and government. Listen to this urban legend and try to imagine what this community was concerned about.\nPhoto by Adam Dubec from Pexels\nVoice 3 \nOne night a woman had just finished her shopping at the market. She carried the bags to her car. When she got to her car, she struggled to open the door. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain on her foot. A man was hiding underneath her car! He cut her foot with a knife. The woman could not run away because of the deep cut. The man pushed the woman to the ground and stole her car.\nVoice 1 \nAs you probably imagined, this community was concerned about crime against women. This story has been told to many women. It has made some women very afraid of going out alone at night. For other women, the story just encourages them to be careful if they are alone at night.\nVoice 2 \nMany people think that all urban legends are false – that they are not true at all. But not all urban legends are false. Sometimes these stories have some truth in them or a moral lesson that can be learned. We are going to tell another urban legend. This story could be true, or it could be false – but it has a very important lesson about how we should live. The story begins with two young men, leaving school at the end of the day.\nVoice 4 \nBill was walking home from school. It was Friday. He was excited about the weekend. As he crossed the street, he saw John – a new student at the school. John was carrying all of his books. But why? Was he planning to study all weekend?\nTwo boys at school; Flickr user enixii., CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nThen Bill saw another group of students. They walked over to John. They pulled his books out of his hands and shouted mean words. Bill was angry. He ran over to John and helped him gather his books from the ground. He told John,\n“Do not worry John. Those students are stupid. They do not know what they are doing.”\nJohn looked at Bill and smiled gratefully. He thanked Bill. The two boys walked home together and talked. Bill asked about all the books, but John just said that he hoped to do some work at home.\nAfter that night, they became good friends. They spent a lot of time together playing football and studying. They stayed at the same school for several years. John became very successful at school. And he had many other friends too.\nWhen it was time for graduation, John came to talk to Bill. He thanked Bill for his friendship. Then, he talked about the day they met. He told Bill that he had planned to kill himself. He was carrying all of his books so that his mother would not have to collect them from the school. But instead, Bill had been there. He showed John true friendship and care. Bill had saved him. Bill was very surprised. He had never known this story. But now he understood John’s grateful smile. And he understood something else too – the power of friendship.\nVoice 2 \nHave you heard this story before? Sometimes the details are different – in some stories, John gives a speech to the whole school, thanking Bill. In others, the boys only meet one time. But the point is the same – one person can make a difference through kindness and care. Even though we do not know the truth of the events, that message is definitely true!\nVoice 1 \nYou should not always believe everything you hear. When you hear a story like this, think about what it might be telling you. There is usually a deeper meaning. What urban legends are popular where you live? What are your favorite urban legends?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nWe begin today’s program with a story.\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nKwesuka sukela – once upon a time – there lived a woman named Manzandaba and her husband Zenzele. They lived in a traditional home in a small Zulu village. At night they sat around their open fire with their many children. “Mama” the children cried. “Sifuna izindaba! We want stories! Tell us some stories, mother!” Manzandaba would think and think. But she and Zenzele did not know any stories. They asked their neighbors, but their neighbors did not know any stories. They listened to the wind. But the wind did not know any stories. There were no stories anywhere.\nVoice 1 \nCan you imagine a world without stories? This story we just began is a story from the Zulu people of Southern Africa. It is a well-known imaginary story. It tells how all stories began. In the story, stories were a gift to a mother long ago.\nStories are important to every culture in the world. They are a way to entertain us, teach us, preserve our culture, and to help us make good choices. Around the world, people celebrate the telling of stories on World Storytelling Day in the month of March. So today, we will celebrate this day with you! Today’s Spotlight is on stories. First, we continue the story of Manzandaba.\nVoice 2 \nManzandaba did not know any stories. So, she kissed her husband and children goodbye and left her home to find some stories. Manzandaba decided to ask every animal she met if they knew any stories. She asked each animal. Some were kind, but some were not kind at all. Some of the animals lied to her and said they had stories they would not share. Other animals tried to help her by giving advice. But none of the animals had any stories for Manzandaba.\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\nFinally, a big sea turtle offered to take Manzandaba to the Spirit People under the sea. She held onto the turtle’s shell very tightly until she reached the very bottom of the ocean. The Spirit People agreed to give Manzandaba stories if she would give them a picture of her home on the dry land. Manzandaba gave them the picture. They gave her a large, beautiful shell. They told her “Whenever you want a story, just hold this shell to your ear and you will have one!” When Manzandaba returned to land, her children asked her:\n“Sifuna izindaba! We want stories! Tell us some stories, mother!” Manzandaba sat down on the shore. She held the shell to her ear, and she began: Kwesuka sukela…\nAnd this is how stories began.\nVoice 1 \nWorld Storytelling day is not just a celebration of good stories. It is a celebration of the art of storytelling. Throughout history there have been many famous storytellers. William Shakespeare. Rabindranath Tagore. Aesop. Nasreddin Hodja. These are all famous storytellers from around the world. They make stories with interesting characters and wonderful events.\nBut some storytellers use stories to teach good advice or give a moral lesson. Even simple stories can have big lessons. Usually these stories are called fables. This is the story of the Wise Old Man.\nImage by Yogendra Singh from Pixabay\nVoice 3 \nIn a village, there was a very old man. Every day, people came to the old man complaining about the same problems. One day the old man told them a joke. Everyone laughed and laughed. After a few minutes, the old man told them the joke again. A few of the people smiled. The old man told them the joke a third time. This time, no one laughed at all.\nThe old man told them: “You cannot laugh at the same joke over and over. So, why are you always crying about the same problem?”\nVoice 1 \nIn this story, the wise old man tries to teach people a lesson. Worrying and complaining cannot solve any problems. It will only waste your time and energy.\nOur final story also has a moral meaning behind it. It comes from Nigeria. This is the story of The Two-Colored Coat.\nVoice 2 \nTwo boys were great friends. They promised they would remain friends forever. When they got older, they built their houses opposite each other. A small path formed a border between their two farms.\nOne day a trickster came from the village. He decided to play a trick on the friends. He clothed himself in a two color coat. One side of the coat was red. And the other side was blue. The trickster walked along the narrow path between the houses of the friends. The two men were working opposite each other in their fields. The trickster made noise as he passed. He wanted to make sure each man looked up and saw him passing.\nAt the end of the day, one friend said to the other:\n“Did you see that man today with his beautiful red coat?”\n“Do you mean the blue coat?” The other replied.\n“No. His coat was red. I saw the man clearly as he walked between us!” said the first.\n“You are wrong!” said the other man. “I saw it too. And it was blue!”\n“I know what I saw!” said the first man. “The coat was red!”\n“You do not know anything!” the second man replied angrily. “It was blue!”\nThe two men argued over and over. They insulted each other. And then, they began beating each other!\nThe trickster returned. He watched the two fighting men. He listened to their shouts. “Our friendship is over!”\nThe trickster laughed. And he showed them his two-colored coat. The men were angry! They shouted:\n“We have lived side by side all our lives – like brothers! Now you have started a war between us!”\nThe trickster replied,\n“Do not blame me for the fight. Both of you are wrong. And both of you are right. What each one saw was true. You are fighting because you only looked at my coat from your own side of the path. You did not think there was another way of looking at the situation.”\nVoice 1 \nSimple stories can have deep truths. They can show us life in a different way. They can teach us how to live. They are one of the most ancient traditions surviving today. Think about a story that you have learned from. Is it an old story or a new one?\nWhat is your favorite story?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nDo you know the story of Santa Claus? It is one of the most popular Christmas stories. He brings toys and gifts to good girls and boys. He flies in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer. The story of Santa Claus has changed over the years. It has been told in books, films, and music.\nVoice 2  \nIn 1939 Robert L. May wrote a new story about Santa Claus. This story soon became a well-known part of the story, or legend, of Santa Claus. This story has now been told in books and films. It is also a song. The song has even become one of the most popular Christmas songs of all time. Do you recognize it? Today’s Spotlight tells the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nReal reindeer live in groups in forests. They live in very cold places. They have large antlers made of bone on their heads. But in this story, reindeer can also fly! They guide Santa’s sleigh on the night before Christmas.\nVoice 2  \nRudolph was a young reindeer. He wanted to play games and climb trees with other reindeer. But the other reindeer did not let him. Instead, they called him names. That is because Rudolph was not like all the other reindeer. Their noses were black or brown. But his nose was red. And it was like a bright light. A bright, red, light. The other reindeer would say,\nVoice 3  \n“Ha ha! Look at Rudolph! Look at his nose! It is as red as an apple! But it is much too big! It is so bright that I cannot even look at it!”\nRankin/Bass Productions\nVoice 1  \nThese words made Rudolph cry. He knew that what they said was true. Still, he was a good reindeer. He listened to his parents. He tried to obey what they told him to do. But he was very lonely.\nVoice 2  \nOne year, on the day before Christmas, Rudolph felt excited. He went to sleep, knowing that Santa would come that night.\nVoice 1  \nBut Santa was having trouble. There was very bad weather. There was snow and fog. This would make it difficult for him to see where he was going. He would not see the stars or the moon. He would not know which way to go. He hoped he would be able to use house lights to guide his way. He was worried that he would not be able to reach all the boys and girls. But he called to his team of flying reindeer to come to him.\nVoice 4  \n“Come Dasher! Come Dancer! Come Prancer and Vixen! Come Comet! Come Cupid! Come Donner and Blitzen!”\nVoice 2  \nSanta loaded up his sleigh with toys and gifts. He connected each reindeer so they could pull together. Then off they all flew into the air. It took all of Santa’s skill not to get lost. But they crashed into the tops of trees. They almost hit an airplane as it flew through the clouds. Santa was able to continue to leave presents by using the lights from houses. But as house lights went out, it got darker and darker.\nVoice 1  \nThe next house he visited was Rudolph’s. It was very dark now. Santa fell down and hurt his knee. He fell down again. Now he was very worried that he would not be able to continue. Then he entered Rudolph’s room to leave a present. To his surprise he found light. It was not a lamp. It was a nose! This gave Santa a wonderful idea. He woke Rudolph from his sleep. Rudolph could not believe what he was seeing. Santa was here!\nVoice 2  \nSanta told Rudolph of all the trouble he was having. He told him about the fog and the dark. He told him about getting lost and crashing into trees. He told Rudolph how he was afraid that the boys and girls of the world would be sad if they woke without gifts. Then Santa asked Rudolph if he would help.\nRankin/Bass Productions\nVoice 4  \n“You may save the day. Your nose is so wonderful. I need you to help me tonight. To lead all my deer on the rest of our flight.”\nVoice 1  \nRudolph smiled. No one had ever said that his nose was wonderful – especially not someone as important as Santa Claus. For a reindeer, the best honor was to be chosen to pull Santa’s sleigh. Rudolph could not believe what was happening. He ran outside. He took his place in front of all the other reindeer.\nVoice 2  \nSoon, Santa was flying through the night again. Now he could go fast. Now they did not get lost or crash. They finished giving all the gifts just as the sun began to rise. All the other reindeer were just now waking up. But Rudolph was not in his bed! They wondered where he had gone.\nVoice 1  \nThen they heard the sound of bells. Santa and his reindeer flew out of the sky. Could it be? Was that Rudolph? Rudolph landed in front of the other reindeer. They had all called him names and not let him play with them. Now, Santa told all the reindeer that he had never seen a reindeer so brave as Rudolph. Santa told everyone that when it was dark or there was fog, Rudolph would lead the sleigh again.\nVoice 2  \nIn fact, this Christmas, if you listen carefully, you may hear them call, as they drive out of sight: Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!\nVoice 1  \nThe story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer has many versions. But in every story, one thing is the same. Rudolph learns to accept who he is. In the beginning, Rudolph has a part of himself that he does not like. He feels shame. But by the end of the story, it is that very thing that everyone celebrates!\nVoice 2  \nWe are all like Rudolph in some ways. We all have things about ourselves that we feel shame about or do not like. But this Christmas, maybe we can be a little more like Rudolph. We can find a way to shine our light and make the world a little brighter.\nVoice 1  \nTell us what you think about the story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3 \n“As I walk toward the mountain, I try to understand what has gone wrong. This does not help. I am in good shape. I have not run too fast. I ate and drank liquids. Normally, I am great at knowing what my body can do. But today I have lost all desire. I do not have foot blisters, legs cramps, painful knees, or any usual running problems. But my brain has gone away. It will not tell my legs to get going. I cannot explain this. I am only reporting.”\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThis was written by Amby Burfoot for Runner’s World Magazine. He was writing about the Comrades Marathon. Many people consider this race to be the greatest running race in the world. But the Comrades Marathon is not only about professional runners. The Comrades Marathon celebrates normal people doing something amazing. Today’s Spotlight is on the Comrades Marathon.\nVoice 2 \nThe Comrades Marathon began with Vic Clapham. During World War I, Clapham saw pain, death, and struggle. From 1914 to 1918 he served in the South African Army. Many people think World War I happened only in Europe. But there was fighting in places like South Africa as well.\nVoice 1 \nClapham saw a lot of suffering. But he also saw men come together and support each other. He was amazed by how the soldiers dealt with such difficult conditions. When the war ended, Clapham wanted to honor all the men who died. But he did not want to just build a statue. He wanted to test people’s strength and courage.\nVoice 2 \nHe decided to hold a running race. It would be a 56-mile run from the city of Pietermaritzburg to the city of Durban. He would be honouring the men he fought with — his comrades. So, he called it the Comrades Marathon.\nVoice 1 \nAt first, he had trouble. Many people thought it would be too long and too difficult. Clapham disagreed. His comrades had been normal people. They had carried heavy equipment and marched all over Africa. And he believed that trained athletes could run 56 miles. So, the first Comrades Marathon was held on May 24, 1921. There were only 34 runners.\nVoice 2 \nThe Comrades has been run every year since then, except during World War II. It has become more and more popular. Today, the Comrades must limit the number of runners. In 2019, only 25,000 could run in the race.\n“19.06.2000 Comrades Marathon Strecke” (CC BY 2.0) by Running.Queen\nVoice 1 \nThe Comrades is not just any race. There are many traditions that set Comrades above other races. First there is the distance. Fifty-six miles is longer than two marathons! Running a marathon is amazing. Running two together? That’s something special.\nVoice 2 \nMost races run the same direction every year, but not Comrades. One year it goes from Pietermaritzburg to Durban. Then the next year it goes the other way, from Durban back to Pietermaritzburg. You can run Comrades twice and have a different experience each time.\nVoice 1 \nAlso, there are different coloured race numbers, or bibs. Runners wear these bibs on their shirts. If you finish nine Comrades you get a special yellow bib. If you finish more than ten, then you get a green bib. The number on this bib becomes yours forever. No one else will ever get that number. You have earned it.\nVoice 2 \nFinally, the race ends at 12 hours. When the clock gets close to 12 hours, the race director walks to the finish line. He stands with his back to the runners and watches the clock. As the time gets closer, the crowd goes wild. They cheer people to run faster. Runners must push themselves to finish. There are no excuses. Twelve hours after the race began, the race director stops the race. The Comrades is over. Those who finish in 12 hours and one second will get nothing. No medal. No recognition. No record of their effort. However, Burfoot writes:\nVoice 3 \n“There is something for the first non-finisher. He or she becomes an immediate hero. She is on television and on the front of every newspaper. To many South Africans, the Comrades runner who goes all that distance, for nothing, is more of a symbol than the winner. That is another great tradition. It is one I think we all can accept, even if we are not sure what it means.”\nThe Finish Line“Finish line, Comrades Marathon 2010” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by Kleinz1\nVoice 1 \nThe Comrades shares this spirit in other ways too. South Africa used to be governed by the laws of Apartheid. Apartheid laws segregated, or separated, the people with dark skin from people with light skin. It was illegal for a person to marry someone with another skin color. Apartheid laws favored the white race. Life for non-white South Africans was very difficult under Apartheid.\nVoice 2 \nIn these conditions, the Director of the Comrades Marathon wanted to make the race an international event. So, in 1975, the Comrades Marathon changed its rules. They said women could run with men, black people could run with white people, and young people could run with old people. In a few years, many more black and female runners were running the Comrades Marathon. This was 20 years before the end of the Apartheid laws.\nVoice 1 \nIs the Comrades Marathon the greatest footrace in the world? There are strong reasons to think so. The strongest reason is that Comrades is about something more than running – especially for South Africans. Writer Jacob Dlamini explains:\nVoice 4 \n“The Comrades is a way to tell the history of modern South Africa. Comrades tells us a lot about who we are and what we are able to do. It is a race started as a celebration of human ability. But it limited that celebration to only a few until the 1970s. Now it is a race that shows the best of what South Africa has to offer. By doing that, it permits South Africans to compete against the very best in the world. More importantly, the Comrades puts such mental and physical demands on its runners that differences of race, ethnicity, gender and class are meaningless. The hills of Comrades do not care how much money you have, what kind of hair you have, or what language you speak.”\nVoice 2 \nDo you think Comrades is a good test of courage?

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nDo you like to be afraid? Many people around the world enjoy feeling fear. They love telling and listening to frightening stories. Many cultures tell different kinds of scary stories. Some involve creatures beyond what we can see and feel. Others are about dangerous monsters, like evil spirits. Today’s Spotlight is on scary stories and why people tell them.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nThe feeling of fear is a strong one. Being frightened creates extreme feelings in the body. When a person is scared, her heart beats faster. Her senses like touch and hearing might become stronger for a short amount of time. Some people tell scary stories to experience these extreme feelings.\nBut telling scary stories can also have a more complex purpose. Scary stories are often fantasy – they are not real. They only happen in a person’s imagination. Telling frightening stories is safe. But it lets people think about what they fear in real life.\nFor example, scary stories can be about frightening places. These places are real, but there are stories about them. One of these places is in Mexico. In English it is called “The Island of the Dolls.” Dolls are toys shaped like human children. Sometimes they can make a person feel strange and afraid. On this island, there are thousands of dolls. They hang from trees everywhere. They are missing body parts and they are dirty. Adam Navis tells the story of the Island of the Dolls.\nAdam Navis \nDon Julian Santana Barrera lived alone on a small island. One day something horrible happened. Don Julian found a little girl floating in the water. The little girl had drowned! A little while later he saw her doll floating down the river.\nDon Julian felt very bad about the little girl. So he hung her doll from a tree, to remember her. He believed the girl became a ghost, and visited Don Julian. He believed he heard strange whispers and sad sounds in the darkness. The girl’s ghost wanted him to find more dolls. So Don Julian continued to hang more and more dolls from the trees.\n“I see dead dolls …” (CC BY 2.0) by Esparta\nWhen he died, his nephew found Don Julian’s body in the river. It was the same place where he had found the girl. Today, there are still dolls everywhere on the island.\nVoice 1  \nThis story may make a person feel strange and afraid. It just seems wrong. But scary stories can also have a particular purpose. They can teach a lesson. Fear can influence behaviour. This is the case in a story from Japan. Bruce Gulland tells the story of the Jikininki.\nBruce Gulland\nIt is late at night in a small village in Japan. A man named Muso is sleeping. He has travelled all day. Finally, he has found a room to stay for the night. But in the middle of the night, a boy wakes Muso. “We need to leave,” he says. “Why?” Muso asks sleepily. The boy answers: “There has been a death.” The boy is shaking with fear. He continues: “You are a stranger here, and do not know. Frightening things happen in this village after a death. So we must leave.\nBut Muso does not leave. He is a priest. It is his duty to say prayers over the dead. Later that night, Muso sees a spirit. As Muso watches, the spirit does something very horrible. It eats the dead body. Muso watches, too frightened to move. He has seen a Jikininki – a kind of evil spirit.\nBy Brigham Young University – https://archive.org/details/bakemonozukushie00, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=74833240\nLater in the story, Muso finds the Jikininki. He discovers it is the spirit of a greedy priest. The priest stole money from dead bodies when he was alive. As punishment for his evil acts, he became a Jikininki. At the end of the story Muso frees him. But the greedy priest suffered as a Jikininki for 100 years.\nVoice 1 \nThe story of the Jikininki teaches a simple lesson about greed. But some writers also like to tell scary stories about more complex ideas. A very famous example is by an English writer named Mary Shelley. There are no spirits, or magic in this story. It is about a normal person – a scientist. Christy VanArragon tells the story of Frankenstein:\nChristy VanArragon \nVictor Frankenstein was a very intelligent scientist. But he wanted to do impossible things. In his experiments he learned how to give life to non-living things. Using this knowledge, he created a creature from old, dead, body parts. And then he gave it life! The creature was intelligent. It could speak, read and write. But the creature was also very ugly. So Victor told it to leave.\nThe creature only wanted a friend. But everywhere it went, people were frightened of it. They thought the creature was evil. It began to hate Victor Frankenstein for giving it life. So it hurt Victor. It even killed his wife. At the end of the book, Victor dies. The creature cries over Victor’s body. Victor only wanted to bring good things to the world. But by creating the creature, he destroyed both it and himself. The creature runs away and is lost forever.\nBy Diego Torres Silvestre from Sao Paulo, Brazil – Frankenstein, CC BY 2.0\nVoice 1  \nThe story of Frankenstein is not as frightening as other scary stories. Instead, it questions the things people fear. The creature looks very frightening. So people believe it is evil. But it does not want to be a monster.\nSo, why do scary stories continue to be popular around the world? Neil Gaimon is a British writer of scary stories. In a 2014 TED talk he explained another reason why he thinks scary stories can be good for people. He said:\nVoice 5  \n“Fear is a wonderful thing in small amounts. You begin the scary story knowing you will come out after a time in safety. It is always good to know that you are still here, still safe. You know that nothing strange has happened, not really. It is good to be a child again, for a little while. It is good not to fear real scary things like governments or relationship or money problems or distant wars. But instead we can fear things that do not exist.”\nVoice 1  \nDo you like to be frightened? What kind of scary stories have you heard? Tell us what you think! You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nThink about a time when someone helped you in a big way. You probably wanted to say thank you to that person in a special way. We all want to say thank you sometimes!\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \n In the United Kingdom, one very old man decided to say thank you in an interesting way. He wanted to thank the doctors and nurses who helped him when he was sick. But Tom Moore did not just want to say ‘thank you’. He wanted to do something. What he did had amazing results. And it encouraged people around the world as they all faced a difficult time. Today’s Spotlight is on Tom Moore and his special ‘thank you’.\nVoice 1 \nTom Moore was born in April, 1920. At age 98, he fell and broke his hip bone. He received treatment from the doctors and nurses of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.\nPhoto by Emma Sohl and Capture the Light Photography; used by permission\nVoice 2 \nBy 2020 he was back at home with his family. He had recovered well. But he now had to use a walker. This special frame, or support, helped him walk. He wanted to say a special ‘thank you’ to the doctors and nurses who had helped him to recover.\nVoice 1 \nBut at this time people around the world were suffering from the COVID19 virus. This coronavirus could be deadly. In the United Kingdom, the government told everyone to stay at home. They said people needed to stay at home to protect the health service. Doctors and nurses were very busy in hospitals taking care of people who were sick and dying from the coronavirus. If too many people became sick the health service would not be able to serve everyone. More people would die.\nVoice 2 \nSo like everyone else Moore had to stay at home. But he wanted to raise £1000 for charities to help doctors and nurses. He knew that they needed special support during the coronavirus crisis. So he decided that he would walk 100 times around the garden at his home. He wanted to do this before his 100th birthday. He would ask people to give money while he walked.\nVoice 1 \nSo on the 9th of April his family launched a JustGiving fundraiser. JustGiving is an online tool that helps people raise money for good causes.\nVoice 2 \nLocal newspapers and television reported the story. People reacted immediately and started to give money to his cause. In just one day the family had to increase the target to £100,000.\nVoice 1 \nThe next day, Moore appeared on national BBC television. He wanted people to help him support the doctors and nurses of the health service. By this time, everyone knew that Moore had been a soldier and called him ‘Captain Tom’. As a soldier, he had experienced rough and difficult times in his long life. Because of this, the BBC asked him if he could encourage people about the future. He replied,\nVoice 3 \n‘Remember, tomorrow is a good day. Tomorrow you will perhaps discover everything will be much better than today.’\nVoice 2 \nPeople across the country loved what he said. And they loved what he was doing. Every day, Captain Tom slowly walked in his garden. Every day, people quickly gave money. By April 14th, 2020 he had raised £1,000,000. It had only been five days! Money continued to come. Captain Tom was surprised but pleased and said,\nVoice 3 \n‘Three, four, five million. I turn my back for a few minutes, and it has gone up again.’\nPhoto by Emma Sohl and Capture the Light Photography; used by permission\nVoice 1 \nPeople saw Captain Tom as a point of light in dark days of coronavirus. Every day, people had seen reports of increasing numbers of deaths from coronavirus. Now every day they watched the increasing amount of money Captain Tom raised. He was giving them hope when they needed it.\nVoice 2 \nOn April 16th, Captain Tom completed his official walk. He had raised over 12 million pounds. People from over 50 countries had given money. He had inspired and encouraged people around the world. From India to Saudi Arabia people reported the good news of his achievement. The head of the World Health Organisation said it united people.\nVoice 1 \nCaptain Tom kept walking. By his 100th birthday on the 30th of April he had raised over 31 million pounds. He had given people something positive to concentrate on. Now they wanted to say ‘thank you’ to him.\nVoice 2 \nAbout 140,000 people sent him cards for his 100th birthday. Airplanes flew over his home. A train was named after him. Artists produced many works of art in his honour. Many famous people sent him special messages. The UK Prime Minister recorded a message for him that said,\nVoice 4 \n‘Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the whole nation. You are a point of light in all our lives.’\nVoice 1 \nOn the 17th of July, a few months later, the Queen thanked Captain Tom in a very special way. She knighted him. This is the highest honour in the UK. It means he is now called Captain Sir Thomas Moore.\nCaptain Tom mural on the side of the Maltshovel, Beastfair, Pontefract, West YorkshireBy Mtaylor848 – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\nVoice 2 \nCaptain Sir Tom had raised over 32 million pounds. This money came from over one and a half million supporters in 53 different countries. It was the largest single JustGiving appeal. The money raised supported the well-being of doctors, nurses and patients. It bought simple things that made their lives easier in a difficult time. For example, it bought food and drink, quiet rooms, and cream to heal hands made rough from washing.\nVoice 1 \nDuring the coronavirus crisis many people were inspired by Captain Tom. They followed his example. Some people did their own walks to raise money for good causes. But everyone can help in some way during a crisis. Help can come in the form of a letter or a simple telephone call asking how someone is doing. Sometimes people feel that they cannot do anything to help. But we must remember that simple offers of help can have big results.\nVoice 2 \nHave you ever said ‘thank you’ to someone who helped you in a difficult time? How have you helped someone else?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of an old man. The man is crouching on the edge of the sun. All around him there is only darkness. There is nothing but this man and an empty world. In his hand, the man holds a tool called a compass. This is a tool people use to create perfect circles on paper. Builders use them to design buildings. Usually, compasses are made of steel. But this compass is made of gold. And the man is not using it on paper. He draws with the compass on the emptiness around him. His long white hair blows in the wind.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called Ancient of Days. It is by the English poet and painter, William Blake. Blake painted it in 1794. The painting shows Blake’s version of the creation of the universe. Here a being like the Christian God designs the world from nothing. \nVoice 1\nLike many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.\nToday’s Spotlight is on William Blake.\nVoice 2\nWilliam Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:\nVoice 3\n“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“\nVoice 2\nWe do not know if Blake really saw these things. We do not know if he only imagined them. We do not know if he saw something he could not explain. But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.\nVoice 1\nBlake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:\nVoice 4\n“I attempted every morning for two weeks to follow your directions. But I found all of my attempts were unsuccessful. So, I decided to show an independence that I know will please you better. I will not follow the path of another, however wonderful that path may be. At any rate, my excuse must be: I could not do anything else. It was out of my power!”\nVoice 2\nDoctor Trussler was not happy with Blake’s new direction. He told Blake the images were not realistic. Trussler refused to have Blake work for him again.\nVoice 1\nBut though Blake was not wealthy, he continued to make his own art. He created his own way of engraving on copper. And, he began writing poetry. Blake created many books of poetry. And, he would make images to go along with his poems. Some of these books were about the future as Blake imagined it.\nVoice 2\nBut he also wrote poems about love and wonder. One of Blake’s best known poems is called The Tyger. It is from his book Songs of Innocence and Experience. Nick Page reads part of Blake’s poem.\nVoice 5\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\nVoice 1\nBlake’s poem speaks about the creation of a tiger. He compares the process to making steel or iron. This process, called forging, is dangerous. It needs a lot of heat and strength. Blake wonders who could create such a powerful thing. He asks who would have that kind of strength.\nVoice 2\nBlake died in 1827. At that time, few people knew who he was. But soon Blake’s work gained wider recognition. People saw his paintings as strange when he was alive. But today we recognize that these works are one of a kind. Blake’s paintings are powerful markers of faith and creativity. His poems also influenced many writers.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake did not seem to care about popularity. He believed in his art. And he believed in the things he saw. He felt it was important to express what he believed. And he worked toward doing this with everything he had.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of two women. They have the same face. But one is wearing a white European-style dress. The other wears a traditional Mexican skirt. You can see both of their hearts. And a single blood vein connects them. The woman in the white dress has cut a vein with scissors. Her dress is stained with blood. The women are holding hands. Behind them, there are dark clouds, like a coming storm.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called The Two Fridas, by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. This is a painting of herself. She painted it after she and her husband divorced. It symbolizes the pain and longing of this lost relationship. Kahlo often painted herself. But she did not just paint what she could see. Her painting expressed what she felt, with symbols. Using these symbols, she was able to paint about disability, love, and the traditional Mexican life. She is still an important artist today. Today’s Spotlight is on Frida Kahlo.\nVoice 1\nFrida Kahlo was born in Mexico, in 1907. She began painting when she was very young. But she did not think of it as a job. Instead, she wanted to be a doctor. She even attended school to become a doctor. But when she was 18, she was in an accident. Kahlo was riding on a bus. The bus driver crashed into an electric train, going full speed. The crash hurt Kahlo very badly. She broke her legs, foot, pelvis, and collar bone. Worst of all, a metal rail speared her through the stomach. It shattered parts of her spine. And it made it so she could not have children. Because of the crash, she lived in pain for the rest of her life.\nVoice 2\nLater, Kahlo would paint about her pain. One of the most famous of these paintings is called Broken Column. It is another self-portrait. In it, she is naked from the waist up. Small, white tears fall from her eyes. All over her body, nails stick out from her skin, though there is no blood. But this is not the strangest part. From her neck to her waist, there is a huge gash. It looks as if it has been left by an earthquake. Inside the gash is a tall, stone column. It is like those that hold up old houses. And the column is broken into pieces. A yellow desert stretches off behind her.\nVoice 1\nThe crash destroyed Kahlo’s body. She would never be a doctor. But the crash also gave her time to paint. And, in 1928, she met Diego Rivera. Rivera was a famous Mexican painter. He painted murals. In making a mural, a person paints directly onto a wall. Rivera’s murals were very large, public pieces. They showed the indigenous people of Mexico and industrial workers. Kahlo asked Rivera what he thought of her painting. He wrote later about that first meeting with Kahlo. He said her paintings: “had a deep honesty, and an artistic personality of their own.” He said it was clear “that this girl was a true artist.”\nVoice 2\nRivera encouraged Kahlo’s painting. And soon, they fell in love. They married in 1929. Together, Kahlo and Rivera traveled the world, painting. But the marriage was not easy. Both of them had many affairs. They often lived apart. They divorced, and re-married. But they also loved each other deeply. Once, Kahlo wrote to Rivera in a letter:\nVoice 3\n“Nothing compares to your hands. Nothing is like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from you.”\nVoice 1\nMany of Kahlo’s paintings are about their troubled relationship. In 1943, she painted Diego on my Mind. It is another self-portrait. In this painting, she wears a traditional Tehuana costume. This white robe wraps around her like a butterfly’s chrysalis. Strange, white threads stretch out from her body. It is like they are holding her in place. And on her forehead is a picture of Rivera. Kahlo painted this after their divorce. It shows that, even though they were apart, she was still thinking of him.\nVoice 2\nKahlo did not find immediate success as a painter. Rivera helped her meet many people. And after a time, she began to show her paintings in galleries. But many people did not take her seriously. They did not believe her art was there because of her skill. They believed she found success because her husband was famous. In 1938, Kahlo went to New York. She had her first solo exhibition. The gallery only displayed her paintings. But the news media did not treat her with respect. A writer for Time Magazine saw the exhibition. He said that Kahlo’s paintings were weak. He did not like the bright colors. And he compared her paintings to ideas of a child.\nVoice 1\nBut soon, people began to recognize Kahlo’s work. The Louvre is a famous art museum in Paris, France. In 1939, the museum bought one of Kahlo’s Paintings. The painting was called The Frame. The Louvre had never purchased a painting by a Mexican artist before. It was a great achievement for her to be the first. Other artists also encouraged Kahlo. André Breton was a French writer. He called her art “a ribbon around a bomb”. He helped her find places to show her work.\nVoice 2\nBut Kahlo was most famous in her native country, Mexico. This is partly because she used images from Mexican culture. For example, one of her paintings is called The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl. The painting shows the universe as a mother. This woman holds Kahlo and Rivera in her arms. From those arms grow the plants of Mexico. The painting also shows Cihuacoatl  holding her. Cihuacoatl is a goddess from Aztec stories. The Aztecs were one of the original peoples of Mexico. And Cihuacoatl was their mother goddess. By including Cihuacoatl, Kahlo shows a motherly love for her husband. But she also shows that her mother is Mexico. It is the thing that gives her life.\nVoice 1\nJust as Kahlo was becoming more famous, she began to get sick. Her health was always bad. But it began to get much worse. The pain in her back made it so she could not stand or sit long. In 1953, doctors removed one of her legs after an infection. She lived either in a bed or a wheelchair. And she abused medicine to manage her pain. Later in the next year, she got sick from pneumonia. This made it hard for her to breathe. She had a terrible fever and was in a lot of pain. She died in 1954. She was only 47 years old.\nVoice 2\nIn the years since she has died, Frida Kahlo has become very famous. Her paintings are world-famous. In 1984, the Mexican Government even declared that her paintings were part of their national heritage. Women celebrate her for her fearless images of female life.

Pictures and words are painted all over the building. This graffiti is crude. It says hateful things about black and brown people. Next to this are symbols from Nazi Germany, swastikas. Above this, someone has written “my Hitler.” This graffiti is meant to be offensive. It is meant to spread hate.\nVoice 2\nThen, a man appears. He is carrying dozens of cans of colorful spray paint. He stares at the wall for a moment. Then, he begins to paint. Over the swastika, he paints two large purple cupcakes. He paints a tube of icing over the racist language. “My Hitler” turns into “My muffins.” Next to the muffins, he paints a small signature. It says “Cibo”.\nSee the video here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CBfS0jJlEqs/\nVoice 1\nCibo is an artist from Italy. His name means “food” in Italian. Cibo paints murals of food over fascist graffiti. He tries to make his city more beautiful. But his real goal is to fight hate with art. Today’s Spotlight is on Cibo.\nVoice 2\nCibo’s real name is Pier Paolo Spinazzè. He lives in Verona, a city in northern Italy. Cibo loves his city. But he also believes the city has a problem: It tolerates hateful people, especially Neo-fascists. Fascism is a kind of extremist way of thinking that appeared in Europe during World War I. It celebrates authoritarians and nationalists. Nazi Germany was a fascist country. For many years, Italy was too. Neo-fascism is a renewal of these beliefs. Neo-fascists do not like people coming to Italy from other countries. They are often hateful to people who are not like them. They will not tolerate diversity, or different ways of thinking. And they will often use violence to enforce their beliefs.\nVoice 1\nNeo-fascism is a growing concern in Italy. Political parties like Forza Nuova express fascist viewpoints. Some groups have committed violent attacks against immigrants and people groups. And incidents like this are increasing. Cibo has experienced this violence. He told Italics magazine in 2019,\nVoice 3\n“I have seen the marks of neo-fascist violence on my friends. Eleven years ago, a group of neo-fascists killed a fellow university student. After that day I decided that that was enough. Although it was not much, I would have, should have done something about it.”\nVoice 2\nSoon after his friend’s death in 2008, Cibo saw a wall full of neo-fascist graffiti. It made him angry. His friend had just died. And here were signs from the people who killed him. So, Cibo did what he knew how to do. He went and got his paints. And he covered the graffiti with an image of big Italian sausages.\nVoice 1\nThe next day, Cibo went back to the same wall. Someone had painted more graffiti over the sausages. But this did not discourage Cibo. Instead of giving up, Cibo painted sauce on the sausage. The sauce covered up the graffiti. And it made his art more detailed. He did this every time someone defaced or ruined his work. The mural became bigger and more interesting. Soon, there was an entire meal, beautifully painted on the wall. After some time, the neo-fascists gave up. Cibo’s mural stayed.\nVoice 2\nThis became a pattern for Cibo. He would find hateful graffiti somewhere in Verona. Then, he would cover it with a painting of food. When someone ruined his painting, Cibo would just change it. Neo-fascists actually helped him make more interesting art! He told Italics:\nVoice 3\n“These ‘fascies’ are dangerous as a group. But on their own, they are a bunch of cowards. I can usually predict what they will do. I use them to create work that gallery artists cannot even imagine! Without their hate, I would never have become so famous.”\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CWVPpW3KDoo/\nVoice 1\nCibo has made it his goal to cover up all hateful graffiti in Verona. And today, he has been doing it for more than ten years. Not everyone likes his work. He has received death threats from Neo-fascist groups. And there are other artists who do not respect his work. But he also has over 350,000 followers on social media. These followers help him locate hateful graffiti. And he has inspired many people to do what he does.\nVoice 2\nBut for Cibo, the goal is not to attack neo-fascists. Instead, his art is a message to the people of Verona, and Italy. He told Italics,\nVoice 3\n“I do not want to challenge just those fascists who spread graffiti. They are fools, and they will get tired of what they do. Instead, I want to overthrow the growing acceptance of hate. People in Verona dismiss teenagers setting a homeless person on fire as a prank. They try to forget about hanging statues of people of color at the stadium. Here, hate has become normal.”\nVoice 2\nCibo paints food because it helps send a message of unity. Almost everywhere in the world food is something that brings people together. When people get together to eat, they get to know each other more. It is easy to dislike someone who you do not know. But when you actually meet them, it is harder to hate. Food is also international. Every culture has their unique foods. But everywhere, food is a comfort and a joy. Instead of hate, Cibo tries to spread this comfort. He also points out that even unique national foods are made of ingredients. Each of these ingredients come from somewhere different. For example, the caprese salad is a very Italian dish. It is made from mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. Cibo often paints this salad. He talked to Quartz magazine about one mural. He said that the caprese is a message.\nVoice 3\n“Caprese is a message that food is open to the world. The basil comes from India. The oil is from Syria. The mozzarella is Italian, and the tomatoes come from Colombia.”\nImage via Instagram. Click the image to go to this Instagram feed.\nVoice 1\nCibo believes that his country is like a caprese. Its people come from many different places. But this does not make them less Italian. Instead, what makes Italy Italy is all of its people, no matter where they are from. The neo-fascists believe that Italy should only behave like one dish. But Cibo presents a varied cuisine. It is full of spice and flavor. And it is made of ingredients that come from all over the world.\nVoice 2\nDo you ever see hateful graffiti? How do you deal with it? What would you do if you could?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nIsadore Charters stands on a beautiful hill in the country of Canada. He looks out at the fields of grass. He sees mountains in the distance. Charters’ hair is now grey. But he remembers many happy days on these hills. When he was a child, he ran over the grass and climbed trees. But when he was young, nobody called him Isadore Charters. The only name he knew was Yenmo Ceetza. His family called him Yummo. But one sad day, officials took Yummo away. They placed him in a government school, far away from his family. And they called him Isadore Charters. Officials took Charters away from everything he knew. And it has taken him many years to find peace and recover from this hurt. Today’s Spotlight is on Isadore Charters and his story of faith and healing.\nVoice 2 \nCharters is a member of the Okanagan and Thompson tribes. These are two of Canada’s first nations – the native people who lived in Canada before Europeans arrived. Charters’ ancestors had lived in the hill country of Western Canada for thousands of years.\nVoice 1 \nAs a child, Charters loved his tribe. And he loved living on their land. But when he was six years old, his life changed. One morning a truck came to his home. Officials took Charters and his brothers. They put the boys in the truck. The truck was filled with other crying children. All the children were from first nations tribes. And the government was placing them in government managed residential schools – far from their homes. The Canadian government threatened the native parents. If they did not send their children to the residential school, the government would send the parents to prison.\nKamloops Lake in British Colombia, Canada; Image from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThis is a common story for many first nations tribe members in Canada. From 1876 to 1996, the Canadian government forced 150,000 first nations children to attend residential schools. The goal of these schools was to force native children to become part of the majority culture. School officials worked to rid Canada of first nations culture. You can hear more about these schools in an earlier Spotlight program called Truth and Reconciliation for Canada.\nVoice 1 \nCharters lived at a residential school managed by the Catholic Church. When he arrived, a nun told him that his name was not Yummo. This female religious worker told him that his English name was Isadore Charters. And from then on, she said that he must only be Isadore Charters. The nuns told Charters that native culture was evil. They said that he needed to forget the ways of his tribe. And they did not let him speak his tribal language. Charters told the Chilliwack Progress news organization,\nVoice 3 \n“They took away who I was – my language, my traditions, my culture.”\nVoice 2 \nOne of the nuns at the school was very kind to Charters. She talked about the love of God and her Christian faith. At times, Charters said he could feel God even at the school. Over time, Charters struggled with the idea of becoming a Christian. The school was managed by Christian leaders that did not respect him or his culture. But he believed strongly in God, and he wanted to become a saint – a holy person of the Christian church. So one day, he got on his knees. He placed his back toward the school and his face toward the grass of the fields. He told God that he wanted to become a Saint. Charters told Spotlight,\nVoice 3 \n“God was there. We were talking. He was talking to me, and I knew he was there.”\nVoice 1 \nBut very soon after that, Charters stopped believing in God. He experienced a terrible tragedy. A worker at the school began to molest him. This person forced Charters to perform sexual acts with him.\nVoice 2 \nCharters became very angry – at the worker and at God. He began using art to express his pain and anger. He made pictures of snakes coming out of peoples’ mouths and pictures with knives and blood. After a short time, Charters began to drink alcohol. He thought alcohol would help get rid of his pain. By the time he was 12 years old, Charters was an alcoholic. He could no longer control his use of alcohol.\nClassroom building of Kamloops Indian Residential School, Kamloops, British Columbia, around 1950; Creator: Unknown / InconnuCanada. Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Library and Archives Canada, PA-207641, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nAs an adult, Charters recognized that he needed to stop drinking. After many years, he decided to seek help. He looked to God and his native culture. Members of other tribes helped him. They prayed with him and encouraged him. This time was very healing for Charters. He came to recognize that he did not have to give up his culture to be a Christian. And he did not have to stop being a Christian to honor his culture.\nVoice 2 \nCharters believes that God was speaking to his first nations people all through their history. He thinks that their beliefs prepared them to hear the message of Jesus. He told Spotlight,\nVoice 3  \n“Our people already knew there was a special person on the earth. That is why it is easy for them to believe in Jesus.”\nVoice 1 \nAfter he stopped drinking, Charters went to art school. Today, he uses art to express the healing he has experienced – instead of only pain and anger. He paints pictures of first nations stories that he remembers from his childhood.\nVoice 2 \nCharters also believes that there needs to be healing between the larger Canadian and first nations cultures. So, Charters proposed an idea to help share his story and encourage healing. He decided to carve a totem pole. Totem poles are important in the native culture of Western Canada. A totem pole is a tall piece of wood. An artist uses sharp tools to carve pictures and symbols into the pole. These pictures tell a story.\nIsadore Charters, carving his totem pole; “Isadore Charters” (CC BY 2.0) by SFU – Communications & Marketing\nVoice 1 \nCharters decided that he would carve a totem pole that told the story of his healing. And he wanted other people to help him carve it. So, Charters traveled to schools, universities, churches and public places. He told his story, and then he invited people to help him. He gave them sharp tools to carve. Then, they could be a part of the healing – not just Charters’ healing, but Canada’s healing.\nIsadore Charters (in blue) watches as a woman helps carve a totem pole at Simon Fraser University in Canada; “Isadore Charters” (CC BY 2.0) by SFU – Communications & Marketing\nVoice 2 \nWhen the healing pole was finished, Charters took it to the residential school where he lived, the school in Kamloops. This particular school was one of the largest residential schools in Canada. The pole was permanently placed in the ground. When it was installed, the community held a celebration to honor the totem pole. The community performed a first nations power dance. Then, they prayed together. And the very place that caused so much pain can now be a place of hope for the future.\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen art help in the process of healing?

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA woman sits on a high, green mountain side in Peru. She watches her animals – a group of sheep and alpacas. She keeps these animals for their hairy wool. The woman is careful to watch the alpaca, but she is also busy in another way. She is weaving wool from the animals to make a colorful cloth. It can be used for clothes, or in a home. She learned this traditional skill from her mother. And she continues to teach her daughters, and other women in her village. She hopes that weaving cloth will create a better future for her community.\nVoice 2\nThe woman is working with the organization Awamaki. Awamaki supports native Quechua communities in Peru. These traditional communities are very poor. But they have a deep cultural history to share with the world. Today’s Spotlight is on Awamaki and their work with the Quechua weavers of Peru.\nVoice 1\nThe Quechua people live in the high Andes mountains in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile. They live a simple life. It is centred on farming and family. They raise sheep. But they also raise many kinds of camelid animals – llamas, alpacas, vicuña, and guanacos. They use these animals for food. But they also use their hairy wool to make clothing and art.\n“Indigenous Weaver” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by Julie Edgley\nVoice 2\nEach kind of camelid animal has a different kind of wool. Llama wool is very rough. They use it mostly for making rope or bags. Vicuña wool is very soft, but can only be harvested every few years. However, people can harvest alpaca wool often. This fine wool is softer and warmer than sheep wool. Baby alpaca wool is the softest and most valued alpaca wool. It is used for fine clothes and scarves for warmth.\nVoice 1\nThe Quechua people also use the wool from these animals to make weavings. Then, they use these weavings to make warm clothes, pieces of art, blankets, and more. The images in Quechua weavings are shared through generations. A weaver repeats images again and again in a weaving. Weavers choose images for their meaning and history. These images include animals, plants, gods, people from history, water, and the stars. The image may not be clear immediately. For example, the whole animal may not appear. The weaver may only show the marks from its feet. A talented weaver combines many different images.\nVoice 2\nAwamaki is based in the town of Ollantaytambo. Ollantaytambo is in what is called “The Sacred Valley” of Peru. This area is high in the Andes between Machu Picchu and Cusco. More than 500 years ago, it was part of the Incan empire – this people group ruled a large area stretching through many countries in South America. Ollantaytambo is a beautiful example of a traditional Incan town. People still use the original Incan walls, farming terraces, and irrigation channels, used to bring water to farms and villages. Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists come through this area each year. They want to see these Incan places, and the Quechua people. Many women in this area weave traditional cloth. And they sell the clothes and other products to tourists. But in the past, they did not get fair prices for their work. They did not know the best things to sell to tourists. And this is how Awamaki helps.\nVoice 1\nAwamaki has four main goals. First, they want to make sure the tradition of Quechua weaving continues. They are helping the Quechua women bring their work to the market, and get a fair price.\nVoice 2\nSecond, Awamaki wants to help the women sell their work around the world. They sell the traditional weaving and clothes over the internet. But Awamaki also connects the women with clothing designers in other countries. They work together to make new and interesting designs.\nVoice 1\nThird, Awamaki also wants to improve the lives of the weavers, their families, and their communities. The women of Awamaki have a regular income. They can depend on earning money each month. The money earned also goes back to their communities. Some of the money is saved in a medical fund for the women and their children. If a medical emergency comes up, the women can use this money to help their families.\nVoice 2\nFinally, Awamaki is helping to save traditional weaving methods. To weave their cloth, Quechua weavers use a backstrap loom. This kind of weaving is special to Quechua weavers. A weaver working with this loom will sit on the ground. One end of the loom attaches to a pole or stick in the ground. The other end of the loom attaches to the weaver by a strap around their back. The backstrap loom is very easy to carry. A weaver can roll it up and take it with her. If she is watching her sheep or llamas in the field, she can bring her loom. If she is visiting friends, she can bring her loom. Awamaki wants to protect this way of weaving.\nVoice 1\nThrough Awamaki, the women also learn new weaving skills. They go on field trips to meet other weavers. By meeting other weavers, they have a chance to learn and improve their skills. Awamaki is also teaching the Quechua women how to use natural dyes. These dyes colour the cloth. In the past, Quechua people dyed all cloth naturally. They would use things like plants, insects, roots, fruits, and seeds. More recently, traders have been bringing new chemical dyes to the weavers. These dyes are cheap. They are also easier – the women do not have to take time to gather and prepare natural dyes.\nVoice 2\nAs a result, many Quechua women forgot or never learned how to use natural dyes. This tradition was about to be lost. But Awamaki trains their weavers to use the natural dyes again. The women are re-learning the old ways of dying wool. The natural colors are much softer, and more beautiful.\nVoice 1\nThese Quechua women are changing their lives. Their work is valued. They earn a fair payment for their weavings. And they can depend on this money each month. They are learning new dying, spinning, and weaving skills. They are able to take care of their families. Through Awamaki, they are building their community.\nVoice 2\nThe writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nImagine this situation: It is 1985. Russia and the United States are enemies. In New York City, a man dies.This was not a normal man. He was a superhero known as The Comedian. Superheroes with amazing powers used to keep the United States safe. But now, most superheroes have retired or lost their power. People in the United States are afraid. They fear nuclear war. They worry it could happen at any time. Many of the nation’s superheroes are afraid of what is happening. But one of these heroes must decide: should he save the human race, or let them die?\nVoice 2 \nThis is the story Watchmen, a book by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. However, Watchmen is not a normal book. It is a graphic novel. Graphic novels use both pictures and words to tell a long story. Today’s Spotlight is on graphic novels.\nVoice 1 \nEarly graphic novels started in the 1930s as comic books. A comic book tells a short story with pictures and few words. Each page of a comic book includes several squares with pictures. The pictures show what is happening in the story. The pictures also have words with them. These words express what the characters are saying or thinking. And each picture tells the next part of the story.\nPhoto by Lena Rose\nVoice 2 \nAt first, comic books were like magazines. Each monthly comic would include a small part of a larger story. Often these stories were about superheroes or other non-human characters. People would have to wait each month to read the next part of the superhero’s story. But in the 1970s, publishers began creating longer comic books. They did this by putting together the stories from all the comic books in a series. Soon, writers wrote longer and longer stories using comic book design. They called these longer books graphic novels.\nVoice 1 \nGraphic novels combine two kinds of storytelling – writing and narrative or story art. Sometimes, a writer can have a good story idea, but she wants to tell her story with more than just words. So she creates pictures of her characters.  These pictures show what a character looks like.  But they can also show what the characters are doing.  By combining pictures and words, the writer can show special details. She can also tell a more complex story with fewer words.\nVoice 2 \nLike all stories, writers create graphic novels for many reasons. Some graphic novels teach a moral lesson. Some are just for fun. And others help readers learn about other people, times and cultures. Not all graphic novels are about superheroes. In fact, some of the most famous graphic novels are true stories. They are about events and situations that happened to real people.\nVoice 1 \nOne famous example is the novel Maus. The novel’s writer is named Art Spiegelman. He lives in New York City. In the early 1980s, he wrote Maus about his father’s experience during World War II. During World War II, the German Nazi army fought for control of Europe. They also tried to rid European countries of particular groups of people – including the Jews. They killed millions of people in planned executions, and in prison camps.\nVoice 2 \nSpeigelman’s father was named Vladek. Vladek ran a factory in Poland before the war. And Vladek was Jewish. During the war, Nazis took Vladek’s factory away. They moved him to the huge prison work camp called Auschwitz. Most Jews that went to Auschwitz did not survive. But Vladek did. After the war, he moved to New York City.\nVoice 1 \nVladek told his story to his son. And Speigelman decided to make a graphic novel about his father’s experience. But instead of creating a story about people, Speigelman made the characters of the story animals.\nVoice 2 \nIn the graphic novel Maus, the Jews are small animals called mice. The Nazis are cats. People from Poland are pigs and people from America are dogs. There are many stories of survival from the Holocaust, but Maus makes the reader look at the story of survival in a new way.\nVoice 1 \nPeople often consider cartoons, like the drawn pictures of animals in Maus, to be funny or childlike. So, some people may think using animal characters makes Maus less serious. However, Lev Grossman would disagree. Grossman is a writer for Time Magazine. He believes using cartoons in Maus makes people notice again a story we may have forgotten.  He wrote,\nVoice 3 \n“Those mice are more human than most people.”\nVoice 2 \nCraig Thompson is another graphic novel writer. As a boy, he loved reading comic books. As an adult, he rediscovered comics and began writing graphic novels. Thompson enjoys creating graphic novels because it combines many of his skills. He told Mother Jones magazine,\nVoice 4 \n“…One person can do it all — do the character designs and create the background setting and write the story.”\nVoice 1 \nIn 2003, Thompson wrote a graphic novel called Blankets. This story is based on his young adult life. Thompson enjoys using his art skills to connect with other people. The beauty of his art communicates much emotion and struggle. Many people can relate to Thompson’s story. He asks questions about the faith he was raised to believe. He also tells about his first love. In his story, many people see their own story of growing up.\nVoice 2 \nFor many people, graphic novels help them feel closer to the story emotionally. They do not just read the words. Instead they look at the pictures too. Readers are also part of the creative process. They must imagine what happens between the pictures and few words the writer provides. They must work harder to understand the story. And for many readers, this helps them remember the story better.\nPhoto by Alicia Quan\nVoice 1 \nThe best thing about graphic novels may be the slowness of the reading process. Graphic novels provide a chance to slow down and think about the story. Thompson told Mother Jones,\nVoice 4 \n“There is something natural about the slowness of reading graphic novels. There is something natural about wanting to resist the fast speed of modern, popular culture. With the graphic novel, it is the opposite of fast speed popular culture – it is about resisting all the internet culture.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer and producer of this program was Dianna Anderson The voices you heard were from the United States and the United Kingdom.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIt is the year 1910. A man walks along the floor of a factory. He wears a clean suit and tie. All around him, men work on conveyor belts. These moving tables bring pieces of machinery to the men. They build the machines together. Soon the machines begin to take shape. They are cars.\nVoice 2\nThe man in the suit smiles. He has many reasons to be happy. His name is Henry Ford, and this is his factory. His cars have made him one of the most successful men in the United States. People all over the world know his name. But Henry Ford also has a secret. He is an anti-Semite, a person who hates the Jewish people. Henry Ford will always be known for his success. In some ways, he changed the world. But his views also hurt many people. These views will forever change how people see him for the worse. Today’s Spotlight is on the complicated legacy of Henry Ford.\nVoice 1\nHenry Ford was born in 1863 in the United States to a family of farmers. His parents were not wealthy. And, Ford did not complete much schooling. Instead, his family expected him to work on the farm.\nVoice 2\nBut Ford believed his life could be different. He soon saw that he had a talent for working with machines. He especially loved working on cars. He even began building his own. These cars were so successful that he was able to start his own company.\nVoice 1\nBut soon Ford saw that there was a problem. During that time, cars took a very long time to build. And, there was no single way of making them. Each car was different, and every part was special to each car. This made cars cost a lot of money.\nVoice 2\nFord believed that he could make cars more quickly, without spending as much money. Instead of building cars one at a time, he would make car parts. Any part would work in any of his cars. And the parts would fit together easily. This would save his workers time and make the job easier.\nVoice 1\nFord also invented the assembly line. The assembly line is a method of working. In an assembly line, workers stand along moving tables. These slow-moving platforms bring parts to the workers. They put put parts together as these come down the line. So they do not have to spend time carrying the parts around.\nVoice 2\nFord’s methods were very successful. Soon he was able to create the Model T. At the time, the Model T cost less money than any other car in the world. Even poorer people could buy one. So, Ford sold many more than other car companies. Soon, the Ford Motor company was the biggest car company in the United States. And everyone began to copy Ford’s methods. Even today, companies use methods like those invented by Henry Ford.\nVoice 1\nBy the end of 1915, Henry Ford was one of the wealthiest people in America. He was also one of the most popular. People used him as an example of the American Dream. This is the belief that anyone in the United States, no matter how poor, can become a success.\nVoice 2\nBut Ford also believed many false and dangerous things. In the 1910’s, he read a book called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. This false document claims to be a Jewish plan to secretly take over the world. It was created in Russia to justify Jewish persecution. But Ford did not know this writing was not true. He believed what he read. And he began to spread his beliefs to other people. For example, he went on a camping trip with several friends. During that time, he spoke a lot about his antisemitic beliefs. One of his friends wrote about it in his personal notes.\nVoice 3\n“He blames all evil on the Jews or the Jewish business owners. The Jews caused the war. The Jews caused an increase in stealing all over the country. The Jews caused the navy to perform poorly.”\nVoice 1\nHenry Ford began to blame the Jewish people for everything in the world that he did not like. He even blamed them for jazz music and some popular clothing styles. He had no evidence. But he was sure he knew something no one else did. And soon, he began to tell the world. In 1918, he bought a newspaper company. It was called the Dearborn Independent. He used the newspaper to spread his antisemitic beliefs. He encouraged many of his workers to buy copies. The places that sold his cars gave them away. He published a book called The International Jew. And some people began to listen. Hasia Diner is a teacher of American Jewish history. She spoke to PBS about why this was so dangerous.\nVoice 4\n“What Henry Ford says, people stop and listen. There are people who wanted him to run for president in the nineteen twenties. If some local food server says something antisemitic, well, nobody cares. Somebody may listen. They may repeat it. But it will not spread far. But Henry Ford was able to gain a national audience with his words. This made him a very dangerous person.”\nVoice 2\nHenry Ford’s words caused bad things to happen. And they spread farther than the United States. Adolf Hitler was the leader of Nazi Germany. He was also an anti-Semite. And, he believed many of the same things as Ford. He is also to blame for the Holocaust. The Holocaust was the deaths of over six million Jewish people and five million others hated by the Nazis. In nineteen twenty-five, Hitler wrote a book. It was called Mein Kampf, or My Struggle. In the book, he called Ford’s work very important. The International Jew gave him and many other Nazis hate-filled ideas. Ford did not kill any Jews himself. But people used his work to make a case for murder.\nVoice 1\nToday, people still read The International Jew. The book is not based on facts. But people still believe it. The book says it is right to hate the Jews. When times are difficult, the book gives them someone to blame. Bill McGraw is a writer at Bridge Magazine. In 2019, he wrote about Ford’s antisemitism.\nVoice 5\n“The internet age has given Ford’s antisemitic literature a strong new life. It has been a century since Ford bought the Dearborn Independent. It has been over 72 years since his death. But his hate is stronger than ever. It grows on websites where people who hate Jews talk to each other.”\nVoice 2\nBy the end of his life, Henry Ford denied his antisemitic beliefs. He saw pictures of the Holocaust. And he could not continue to hate the Jews. He stopped publishing the Dearborn Independent. And his children used much of his money to fight hate. Yet, Ford is a difficult person to talk about. Today, the Ford Motor Company is one of the largest vehicle companies in the world. And Ford created modern manufacturing. Henry Ford helped create some the good things in the modern world. But he also helped create an evil that continues to this day. And it may not be possible to separate the two.\nVoice 1\nHistory is filled with people with complicated pasts.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThe year was 1707. The English ships were in heavy seas. The Weather was bad, and they were lost. The chief of the ships was Admiral Shovell. His officers made an estimate of the ships’ position. But they were wrong. Suddenly, someone shouted ‘Land!’ This call filled the sailors with fear. There should be no land here. They were in the wrong place. Four of the ships crashed into the land. Over 1,600 men died that night. Only 26 survived. It was one of the worst British sea accidents in history. Today’s Spotlight is on one unexpected result of this accident.\nVoice2\nAt the time of the accident, England depended on the shipping industry. Ships brought the people of England sugar, spices, and tea. The people who sailed the ships needed good maps.\nVoice 1\nBut they also needed something more.  They needed to avoid accidents like the loss of Admiral Shovell’s ships. To do this they needed to know exactly where they were. If you look at almost any map, it is divided into small squares by lines.  The lines that go from east to west are the latitude lines. And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars. But they could not measure their east-west position, or longitude, by that method. They needed a good way to measure the ship’s ‘longitude’.\nVoice2\nKing Charles the Second of England knew how important it was to solve this problem.  If the problem was not solved, more ships could be lost. In 1675, King Charles ordered the building of the Royal Observatory. The Observatory was a place where people could study the stars. They could work on the problem of establishing longitude at sea. The King created the Observatory in Greenwich.\nThe first chief of the Observatory was John Flamsteed. Falmsteed worked hard, but he could not solve the longitude problem. And after the loss of Admirals Shovell’s ships, there was even more pressure to find a solution. So in 1714 the British Government offered a prize of GBP 20,0009. The prize would go to the first person who could find a method of measuring longitude at sea. Some people thought that this would never by possible.\nVoice 1\nOur story moves on, to one man – John Harrison. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1693. He was 21 years old when the government offered the prize. Like his father, he was a carpenter. He made things with wood. He did not have much education. But John was very good at making clocks. At that time, all clocks were made from wood. But John made many improvements to the clock design. His clocks did not break, like other clocks. And his clocks were very accurate. Each month they lost or gained no more than one second. They were more accurate than many of the best clocks in London. Three of these clocks still exist. And they are still very accurate!\nVoice2\nHarrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.\nVoice 1\nThe problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.\nVoice2\nIt took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.\nVoice 1\nHarrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.\nVoice2\nHowever, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.\nVoice 1\nHarrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.\nVoice2\nSo in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.\nVoice 1\nThe writers of today’s programme were Shelagh Godwin and Mike Procter.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nSimone was 14 years old when her life changed forever. She was sitting in her village school in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A group of rebel soldiers surrounded the school.  They were from the Lord’s Resistance Army or the LRA. The soldiers kidnapped all the students. They taught the goys to fight and become soldiers. They forced the girls to marry and have sex with other LRA soldiers. If the children resisted, the LRA soldiers beat or killed them.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nLife with the LRA was difficult for Simone. Soon she became pregnant. She had a baby boy when she was only 15 years old. Every day, Simone lived in fear.  She worried that soldiers would kill her or her son. After a year and a half, Simone finally escaped.\nVoice 1\nSimone was free from the LRA. But she was alone and afraid. Then, she met Sister Angelique Namaika. Sister Angelique helped Simone heal and become independent again. Today’s Spotlight is on Sister Angelique and the ways she is caring for female victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army.\nVoice 2\nSister Angelique Namaika has always known what she wanted to do with her life. When she was 9 years old, she lived in the town of Lege, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She remembers a German nun who visited the town. Angelique watched this female religious worker care for the sick. The nun gave out medicine and talked with the people who came to her. Angelique decided then that she wanted to become a nun too. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation, \nVoice 3\n“There was so much work to do. The nun did not have time to eat or rest. I told myself I will do everything I can to become like her. I will help her, so that she may rest.”\nVoice 1\nAnd this is exactly what Angelique did. In 2000, Sister Angelique completed the necessary studies to become a nun. In 2003, she began working in the town of Dungu. Dungu has many refugees. These refugees are victims of LRA violence. Like Simone, many of the women and young girls were kidnapped by the LRA. They suffered much fear and violence. They have escaped from the LRA, but they still suffer many problems.\nVoice 2\nMost of the refugees in Dungu do not own land. They also do not speak the local language. Many of the young girls have very little education They have not learned any skills to support themselves or their children. So they have no way to earn money.  Sister Angelique quickly recognized what she needed to do. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,\nVoice 3\n“We have to help women to become independent. They need to support themselves and their families without being forced to depend on their husbands. That way they learn their true value.”\nVoice 1\nSo Sister Angelique started teaching the women the local language. She teaches them how to read and write. And she listens to their stories. Often by talking together the women find support. They discover they are not alone. They are a community.\nVoice 2\nSister Angelique also teaches the women skills they can use to earn money. She teaches some women to sew clothes. Once they are skilled, they can make school clothes and other thins to sell in the market. Sister Angelique teaches other women to cook foods such as bread. They can sell this food in the market or by visiting houses in the community. Sister Angelique even helped a group of women start a garden. Together they panted seeds and cared for the plants. The women used the vegetables and foods from the garden to feed their families. And they sold what remained.\nVoice 1\nAfter a few years, Sister Angelique opened a centre in Dungu. It is called the Centre for Reinsertion and Development Support or CRAD. At this centre, she can teach many women at one time. The women can also come there to use common resources. But some women live too far away from the centre. So Sister Angelique rides her two wheeled bicycle to visit them.\nVoice 2\nBut Sister Angelique’s efforts do not just concentrate on teaching the women. A major part of her work is helping the women re-enter society. She works to help their communities accept them again. Sister Angelique told the Catholic News Service the story of one 14 year old girl.\nVoice 3\n“One problem she had was that she was rejected by her mother. Her mother said that the girl was responsible or being caught by the LRA. I gave the girl guidance and information. Then I ent to her mother’s house to help the mother and daughter talk and understand each other. So the two of them, the mother and the girl, they made peace and today they are on good terms. The girl is happy because she felt love.”\nVoice 1\nIn 2013, the United Nations Refugee Agency recognized Sister Angelique’s efforts. The organization gave her the UNHRC’s Nansen Award. This major award is given once a year to a person or group doing very good work to help refugees. But for Sister Angelique, the award is not just for her. She told the Al Jazeera news organization,\nVoice 3\n“The award is for the women. I hope it will help us with the basic work of helping them get an education and earn a living. People just want to be a part of something. This helps fight the pain and suffering that comes from their difficult experiences.”\nVoice 2\nOver the years, Sister Angelique has helped more than 2,000 women and children affected by the LRA. Bu she does not do this work to win awards or become famous. Sister Angelique described to Perspective Magazine how her Christian faith encourages her to work.\nVoice 3\n“The Lord identifies with those who suffer. So when I meet a suffering person I recognize that it is God appearing before me asking for help. Even if I have to get up in the middle of the night. I have to do it. I trust in God. It is He who gives me the courage and strength to keep on working.”\nVoice 1\nAnd Sister Angelique shows no signs of stopping. She has given her life to serve victims and refugees. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,\nVoice 3\n“I will never stop doing all I can to give them hope and the chance to live again.”\nVoice 2\nThe writer of this program was Courtney Schutt. The producer was Mark Drenth. The voices you heard were from the United States. All quotes were adapted for this program and voiced by Spotlight.

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of an old man. The man is crouching on the edge of the sun. All around him there is only darkness. There is nothing but this man and an empty world. In his hand, the man holds a tool called a compass. This is a tool people use to create perfect circles on paper. Builders use them to design buildings. Usually, compasses are made of steel. But this compass is made of gold. And the man is not using it on paper. He draws with the compass on the emptiness around him. His long white hair blows in the wind.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called Ancient of Days. It is by the English poet and painter, William Blake. Blake painted it in 1794. The painting shows Blake’s version of the creation of the universe. Here a being like the Christian God designs the world from nothing. \nVoice 1\nLike many people of his time, Blake was a Christian. But Blake was also very different than the people around him. He believed he could see angels. He said that the dead spoke to him. These beliefs made him difficult to work with. People did not value his poetry and art during his life. But his beliefs also made his work some of the most beautiful and interesting of that time.\nToday’s Spotlight is on William Blake.\nVoice 2\nWilliam Blake was born in 1757 in London, England. His family was not wealthy. His father made clothing and was not always paid well. But he had enough money to let his children follow their interests. It became clear early on that Blake was good at art. He would spend hours looking at paintings in the market. He loved them so much that wanted to become an engraver. Engraving was a way of cutting images into wood or metal. Engravers would then color these images with wet paint. Then they could put these images onto paper. Blake became the student of a master engraver. It was clear even then that he had a lot of talent.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake also started seeing things at an early age. As a young child, Blake was wandering in a field. He looked up at a tree to see angels flying in the branches. The angels shocked Blake and filled him with wonder. Anne Malcolmson wrote about William Blake:\nVoice 3\n“He ran to tell his family what he had seen. His father decided that the time had come for the boy to learn the difference between imagination and reality. He threatened to hit him for lying. His mother, however, took his side. When she questioned him about his experience, he described the angels as looking like thoughts. He had seen them in his imagination. But the feeling was vivid.“\nVoice 2\nWe do not know if Blake really saw these things. We do not know if he only imagined them. We do not know if he saw something he could not explain. But Blake strongly believed he saw them. As he grew up, he saw other religious things. They would shape his work powerfully. He would even develop his own version of Christian belief because of these visions. Much of his art represented these things he saw that others could not.\nVoice 1\nBlake’s odd religious beliefs made it difficult for him to find work.  Sometimes this was because people found him too strange. But, mostly, Blake did not want to do work for money. He did not like other people telling him what he could and could not make. So Blake and his family often lived in poverty. When he did find work, he had a hard time doing what he was asked to do. Dr. John Trussler was a successful writer. He was also a member of the Church of England. Trussler asked Blake to work for him. He asked Blake to work under a set of directions. But Blake did not follow them! After finishing his work, he wrote to Doctor Trussler:\nVoice 4\n“I attempted every morning for two weeks to follow your directions. But I found all of my attempts were unsuccessful. So, I decided to show an independence that I know will please you better. I will not follow the path of another, however wonderful that path may be. At any rate, my excuse must be: I could not do anything else. It was out of my power!”\nVoice 2\nDoctor Trussler was not happy with Blake’s new direction. He told Blake the images were not realistic. Trussler refused to have Blake work for him again.\nVoice 1\nBut though Blake was not wealthy, he continued to make his own art. He created his own way of engraving on copper. And, he began writing poetry. Blake created many books of poetry. And, he would make images to go along with his poems. Some of these books were about the future as Blake imagined it.\nVoice 2\nBut he also wrote poems about love and wonder. One of Blake’s best known poems is called The Tyger. It is from his book Songs of Innocence and Experience. Nick Page reads part of Blake’s poem.\nVoice 5\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\nVoice 1\nBlake’s poem speaks about the creation of a tiger. He compares the process to making steel or iron. This process, called forging, is dangerous. It needs a lot of heat and strength. Blake wonders who could create such a powerful thing. He asks who would have that kind of strength.\nVoice 2\nBlake died in 1827. At that time, few people knew who he was. But soon Blake’s work gained wider recognition. People saw his paintings as strange when he was alive. But today we recognize that these works are one of a kind. Blake’s paintings are powerful markers of faith and creativity. His poems also influenced many writers.\nVoice 1\nBut Blake did not seem to care about popularity. He believed in his art. And he believed in the things he saw. He felt it was important to express what he believed. And he worked toward doing this with everything he had.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

They change the colour of the river that runs through the city. They use food colouring to turn the water green! They use about 18 kilograms of this vegetable-based dye for the water. They do this to celebrate an Irish saint – Saint Patrick.\nVoice 2\nMany Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations involve a lot of food and drinks. Some of the food and drinks are green too. Another tradition is to wear green. And if you do not, someone may just pinch you. They may pull a little bit of skin between two fingers. But Chicago is only one place that celebrates Saint Patrick – people in cities and countries around the world celebrate him.\nVoice 1\nBut who is Saint Patrick? And why do people celebrate him on March 17th every year? Today’s Spotlight is on Saint Patrick and his holiday.\nVoice 2\nSaint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland. He is known for his religious work on that island. Historical church documents tell us some things about his life. But he also recorded his life and passion for his Christian faith in his letters.\nVoice 1\nSaint Patrick was bornin Britain around the year 386. At this time, the Roman Empire in Britain was ending. Violent groups from Ireland invaded the land. They stole land, money, animals, objects and even people. When Patrick was 16, people from Ireland raided his family’s home. They took Patrick and held him as a slave. He was kept in Ireland for six years. There, he worked as a shepherd and spent most of his time out in the fields caring for sheep Patrick wrote in his letters that he depended on God when he felt lonely or afraid.\nVoice 2\nAfter being held for six years, Patrick escaped. In his letters, he writes that he had a strange dream. In the dream, he heard the voice of God telling him to leave. So Patrick left. He walked almost 322 kilometres toward the Irish coast. There, he was able to get on a ship to Britain and return to his family.\nVoice 1\nIn Britain, Patrick studied to become a Christian priest. He lived with other religious men, as a monk. But then, Patrick’s writings say that he had another dream, this time from an angel. This angel told Patrick to go back to Ireland.\nVoice 2\nHistorical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.\nVoice 1\nHe also added a circle to the common Christian cross. This became the Celtic cross or the cross of Ireland. The circle was the symbol of the sun. The sun was a powerful Irish symbol for many people. Patrick combined the circle and cross. This showed that Jesus was like the sun.\nVoice 2\nSt. Patrick is also closely connected to the green shamrock plant. It has three leaves. It is often used as a symbol of Ireland. Some stories suggest that St. Patrick used this plant to teach people the Christian idea of the Trinity – that God is three but also one.\nVoice 1\nBut just how did the world start celebrating St. Patrick’s day on March 17th every year? That is because March 17th is the anniversary of St. Patrick’s death. He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day. Then they returned home to eat, drink and dance.\nVoice 2\nAs Irish people moved to other countries, the traditions went with them. The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was in New York City, in the United States, in the year 1762. Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.\nVoice 1\nIn the 17-and 1800’s, large groups of Irish immigrants moved to the United States. This spread Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations to many communities there. But the United States and Ireland are not the only placed that celebrate this holiday. People in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Japan and Russia all celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. People have even celebrated this day on the International Space Station!\nVoice 2\nBut the biggest celebrations today are in Ireland. It has been a public holiday there since 1903. Today, in the city of Dublin, about one million people take part in Saint Patrick’s Festival. This celebration is five days long! It includes parades, music, dancing, outdoor plays, fireworks and more!\nVoice 1\nIn the past, Saint Patrick’s Day was mainly a religious celebration. Until the 1970’s, Irish law even said that the bars must be closed on March 17th. But now in most places, it is more a celebration of Ireland and Irish culture. But no matter why you celebrate, make sure to wear green on March 17th – or you may get pinched!\nVoice 2\nDo people celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day where you live? Do you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIn South Africa a group of elephants starts to walk slowly across the land. These large grey animals walk for more than 12 hours. Their long noses or trunks move from side to side as they walk. This group or herd of elephants goes to the home of their human friend. They have not been there for about two years. But they seem to sense that something has happened.\nVoice 2 \nSomething has happened – their human friend has just died. The elephants seem to mourn his death. They seem to be honouring him. But who was this man? And why was he special to the elephants? Today’s Spotlight is on this man. His name was Lawrence Anthony. Many people called him ‘The Elephant Whisperer’. He was a friend to many wild animals.\nVoice 1 \nLawrence Anthony lived in Zululand, South Africa. He was a conservationist. He worked to protect wild animals and the places they live. He owned a game reserve called Thula Thula. This very large area of land is used to protect wild animals. Such animals do well in game reserves because they can live in their natural environment.\nVoice 2 \nIn 1999, an animal organisation talked to Lawrence Anthony. They told him about a herd of elephants. These elephants were a big problem. They were very dangerous. They charged, or ran at, vehicles and people. The elephants were so dangerous that the authorities would have to kill them. But Anthony did not want that to happen. He wanted to save the elephants. So he decided to give them a home at Thula Thula.\nVoice 1\nThe elephants arrived at Thula Thula in a big truck. They were released into a special area for keeping animals. This area had strong fences. The elephants would get an electric shock if they touched the fence. But still the elephants escaped.\nVoice 2 \nAnthony had to find the elephants. They had left the safety of Thula Thula. Other people would shoot the elephants if he did not find them. After many days he found them. But they had destroyed more property. And they had charged at another man. They were very dangerous.\nVoice 1 \nAnthony brought the elephants home to Thula Thula again. This time he tried something different. He decided to live with the elephants!\nVoice 2 \nHe lived and slept by the elephants for many weeks. But he did not go too close. The elephants got angry if he came too near. But Anthony would sing and talk. He did this for a particular purpose. He wanted the elephants to trust him.  He told the BBC World Service:\nVoice 3 \n‘I would walk around talking to myself. I tried to get them used to my voice. Sometimes I would sing. I would be there for weeks.’\nVoice 1 \nAfter a little while the elephants let him come closer to the fence. He talked to them as if they were people. He told them they were in their new home. He told them that they would be happy. He wanted to persuade the elephants to stay in Thula Thula.\nVoice 2 \nThe leader of the elephants was a female called Nana. Nana was the matriarch. Anthony concentrated his efforts on her. As the weeks passed Nana let him move nearer and nearer. Then one day she put her long trunk through the fence. Anthony moved closer. She reached out. And Nana touched Anthony with her trunk! She had accepted him. Anthony said that everything changed after this happened. He discovered that all the other elephants accepted him too. He told the BBC World Service:\nVoice 3 \n‘I began to understand that once the matriarch makes a decision she communicates it to the herd. The next day there was no tension. The elephants were calm.’\nVoice 1 \nThat day Anthony released the elephants from the fenced area. This was a big decision. If the elephants left Thula Thula they would be shot and killed. But it worked. The elephants knew how to escape. But they chose to stay.\nVoice 2 \nAnthony formed a very special link with the elephants. They became very close. They were friends. His son, Jason, told BBC Radio 4:\nVoice 4 \n‘He could stand and call to them. And call and call and call. And they would come and touch him. An amazing relationship!’\nVoice 1 \nAnthony had a special relationship with elephants. But he wanted to protect other animals too. In 2003, he saw television news of the bombing of Baghdad, Iraq. He knew that there was a big zoo there. He discovered that no-one planned to save the zoo animals. So he decided to save them himself!\nVoice 2 \nHe flew to Kuwait. There he collected supplies. He drove to the border of Kuwait and Iraq. The guards at the border were very surprised to see him. Iraq was a war area. Everyone else was trying to leave Iraq. But Anthony was trying to enter. He explained that he was going to rescue the zoo animals. The guard said that the idea was insane. But he let Anthony into Iraq.\nVoice 1 \nAnthony got to Baghdad. He saw ruined buildings. And he heard gunfire. There was still fighting in the city. But Anthony found the zoo. It was wrecked. Anthony saw many dead animals. Flies were all around them. Other zoo animals had been eaten by local people. But dangerous animals such as lions and tigers had survived. However these animals were deeply shocked. And they were starving.\nVoice 2 \nAnthony and some helpers immediately began to save the animals. Anthony bought donkeys to feed the zoo animals. He paid zoo workers to return to work. It was hard work repairing the zoo. Soon American soldiers started to help. A few weeks later former Iraqi soldiers helped too. These men had been killing each other on the battlefield only recently. Anthony told the BBC:\nVoice 3 \n‘American soldiers were fighting during the day. They put down their weapons at night. Then they would come across to the zoo and help. I was watching American soldiers and Iraqi soldiers both working to help these animals. Completely amazing.’\nVoice 1 \nAnthony stayed in Baghdad for six months. When he left the animals were healthy and the zoo was clean. The zoo had been saved.\nVoice 2 \nAnthony’s work protecting animals could be dangerous. But he learned a lot from animals. In his book ‘Elephant Whisperer’ he explained:\nVoice 3 \n‘They taught me that all life forms are important to each other. There is more to life than just yourself, your family, or your kind.’\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this programme was Katy Blake. The producer was Nick Mangeolles.

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThe woman faced her former prison guard. He and the other guards had done terrible things to her and other women in the prison camp. The guards had beaten the women. They had denied the women food, and medicine. The women had done nothing wrong. They did not deserve this punishment.\nVoice 2\nBut now, years later, the guard had come to her. He was asking her to forgive him. What would she say? How could she answer him? Today’s Spotlight is on this woman, Corrie ten Boom, and her answer.\nVoice 1\nYou may have heard another Spotlight program about Corrie’s father, Casper ten Boom. Casper and his family lived in the Netherlands during World War Two. During that time, the German army controlled that country and many others. They were fighting a war for control of Europe. The German government was also trying to rid these countries of particular groups of people – including the Jews, and Gypsies. They killed millions of people in planned executions, and in prison camps.\nVoice 2\nThe ten Boom family disagreed with these policies. For four years, Casper and his family worked to help Jews and other people in danger. They hid people in their home. They also worked to find safe places for the people to stay – places outside the city where they lived. In this way, they helped to protect more than 80 people.\nVoice 1\nBut finally, in February 1944, the authorities learned of the ten Boom family’s illegal acts. They arrested many members of the family, including Casper, Corrie and her older sister, Betsie.\nVoice 2\nCasper was very old. He died ten days later in prison. Corrie was 51 years old. Betsie was several years older. The two sisters were held in separate rooms at the prison. They stayed in this prison for several months. Then, in June, the authorities moved both sisters to a prison camp. Here, they were together again. But their situation was about to get extremely difficult.\nVoice 1\nIn September, authorities moved many of the prisoners in the camp. Guards ordered them on to a train. This train was originally designed to carry cows. But now, people filled the cars. They had little food, or water. Finally, they arrived at a prison camp in Germany called Ravensbruck.\nVoice 2\nRavensbruck was the largest prison camp for women in Germany. And it was a terrible place. The prisoners had very little food. Guards forced them to work hard. They beat prisoners for any reason. And they also killed many prisoners, by poisoning them with gas.\nVoice 1\nIn the camp, Betsie’s health quickly began to fail. Corrie did everything she could do to protect her sister. She tried to give her extra food. She protected Betsie from the guards, and from difficult work.\nVoice 2\nBetsie also protected Corrie, but in a different way. Betsie followed their father’s example. The family was Christian. Every day, their father read the Christian Bible with his daughters. They also prayed to God together. It was this faith that caused them to protect people in danger. They were following the example of Jesus Christ. Even in the prison camp, the sisters continued to read their Bible and pray.\nVoice 1\nHowever, Corrie was very angry. Instead, Betsie encouraged Corrie to be thankful – even for the little things, and the difficult things. She also encouraged Corrie to forgive. This was the most difficult thing for Corrie. But forgiveness is a central teaching of the Christian faith. Christians believe that God forgives people for the wrong things that they do. They also believe that they must follow God’s example. They must forgive people that do wrong things to them.\nVoice 2\nBetsie did forgive the guards. However, over the months, Betsie became more and more weak. Finally, in December, she died from sickness and lack of food. Soon after Betsie’s death, the authorities released Corrie. Corrie did not know why they released her at this time, but her prison sentence was complete. She returned home to the Netherlands, without Betsie. Corrie moved back into her father’s house alone.\nVoice 1\nCorrie felt lost without Betsie. How could she continue? But slowly, she remembered their talks in the prison camp. Betsie had wanted to share a message of forgiveness. And she wanted to open a home to help people damaged by the war.\nVoice 2\nWhen the war ended in 1945, Corrie opened a home just like Betsie had wanted to. At first, the people who came were former prisoners. But soon, the home also began to serve Dutch people who worked with the German authorities. These people were now suffering very bad treatment from their communities. And they also suffered deep regret for the things they had done during the war. At first, Corrie found it hard to accept these people. But again, she followed Betsie’s example of forgiveness.\nVoice 1\nCorrie also began to travel and tell her family’s story. She wrote a book about these experiences. It is called “The Hiding Place”. In it, she tells the story from the beginning of this program.\nVoice 2\nIn 1947, Corrie spoke at a church in Germany. After her speech, a man came to talk to her. He had been a guard at Ravensbruck. However, since then, he had become a Christian. And he deeply regretted the terrible things he had done as a guard. He asked Corrie for forgiveness. He held out his hand, for her to hold. Corrie wrote about her feelings and thoughts in that second:\nVoice 3\nForgiveness is not an emotion – I knew that. Forgiveness is an act of the will. The will can work, even if the heart is cold. “Jesus, help me!” I prayed quietly, “I can lift my hand. I can do that much. You supply the feeling.”\nVoice 1\nSo Corrie put her hand into his hand. As she did, something amazing happened. She began to feel a healing emotion – it was forgiveness. It filled her heart. And she began to cry. Corrie wrote about what she said:\nVoice 3\n“I forgive you brother!” I cried, “With all my heart!” For a long time, we held each other’s hands, the former guard and the former prisoner. I had never known God’s love as deeply as I did then.\nVoice 2\nCorrie worked with victims of war for the rest of her life. She died in 1983, at the age of 91. Corrie was honored by many governments and Jewish organizations for the work she did. But it was Corrie’s example of forgiveness that brought healing to many people.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Christy VanArragon. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nWould you attach magnets to your head so you could wear glasses? \nVoice 2\nWould you buy beef flavoured water for your dog?\nVoice 1\nWould you buy a golf club that you could use as a toilet? \nVoice 2\nAll of these are failed ideas. Someone thought of them, and someone else paid to make them. But they all failed. Many even seem like jokes. But these are the kinds of real products you will find at the Museum of Failure. \nVoice 1\nThe Museum of Failure takes its display of failed products from place to place. When you visit, you will see of some of the world’s most wonderful, and stupid, inventions ever sold. But the Museum of Failure is not only there so you can laugh at failed products. It also shows how very successful companies often fail – even companies like Apple, Amazon, and Twitter. And you can see how these companies learned from their mistakes. Today’s Spotlight is on the Museum of Failure.\nVoice 2\nDr. Samuel West is a psychologist. He studies corporate behaviour – how and why large companies act the way that they do. He noticed that people do not like to talk about their failures. They cause us shame. But Dr. West believes that failures are important. Failure often leads to success. And, to make something new, it is often necessary to fail. Doctor West started the Museum of Failure so that people could talk about failure more openly. He spoke to the PBS News, about creating the Museum of Failure.\nVoice 3\n“If you explore new methods, new products, and technology, you will probably fail. In fact, ninety percent of new projects fail. This is the real obstacle to change. People are afraid of failing. I was thinking: “what can I do to communicate that we need to start accepting failure, rather than fear it?”\nVoice 1\nSo, Dr. West began gathering failed products and telling their stories. At first, his collection was small. But soon, he gathered over 150 examples of failure. And he opened a museum in Sweden to display them.\nVoice 2\nSome products in the Museum of Failure are just funny. Take for example, the Rejuvenique. The Rejuvenique was a plastic face mask with electrodes inside it. When you put it on, the mask would send small electric shocks onto different parts of your face. Its inventors claimed that the shocks from the mask would make people look younger. But wearing the mask hurt. The mask looked very strange. And there was no evidence that it worked. The product failed soon after its release.\nVoice 1\nThis product seems like a bad idea from the beginning. But it does show the importance of trying. Many people have better ideas than the Rejuvenique mask. But they do not act on them out of fear. The Rejuvinique mask shows that making something new is easier than you think. If someone can fail as badly as this, the risk you are taking does not seem as terrible.\nVoice 2\nSometimes, though, these failures can have terrible consequences. One of the most important failures at the Museum of Failure is thalidomide. Thalidomide is a drug invented in the early nineteen fifties. Today, doctors use it to treat cancer and leprosy. But thalidomide has a dark history. When it was first released, its creators said it was a wonder drug. It helped people sleep. It treated anxiety and worry. It even helped with morning sickness, an illness that sometimes happens during pregnancy. Thalidomide was very popular, and it was supposed to be safe. In some countries, you could even get it without a note from a doctor.\nVoice 1\nBut the makers of thalidomide did not test it well. Or they ignored their tests. Thalidomide was safe for adults. But if a pregnant woman took it, the drug hurt the baby. Thalidomide causes serious birth defects in early pregnancy. It can damage a baby’s brain, its eyes, and its arms and legs. Many thalidomide babies were born with very short arms and legs. Many died. Doctors no longer give thalidomide during pregnancy. But over 24,000 children were hurt after the drug was released.\nVoice 2\nThalidomide was one of the greatest disasters in medical history. But its failure did have some positive effects. Before thalidomide, companies did not have to report the results from all of their tests. There were fewer rules for what they had to test. After the thalidomide disaster, countries forced drug makers to test in more ways. Thalidomide hurt many, many people. But it also made the drugs we take today safer.\nVoice 1\nSome of the products at the Museum of Failure show that failure can even be the secret to success. Teflon is a chemical used in many different products. It makes surfaces very slippery. Nothing gets stuck to Teflon. So, people use it in non-stick cooking pans. It does not let electricity pass through it. A lot of electronic devices have Teflon in them. People also use it in electrical  wiring. And it can also make fabric resistant to stains and water.\nVoice 2\nBut the creation of Teflon was an accident. Roy Plunkett was the chemist who created Teflon. He worked for the American company DuPont. He was trying to mix different chemicals. One night, he left some of these chemicals in a very cold environment. But, when he came to work the next morning, the chemical had changed. Instead of being a liquid, it had turned into a white powder. And Plunkett had no idea what it was.\nVoice 1\nPlunkett could have ignored the material. He could have thrown it away. But, instead, he decided to test the material. He spent six months trying to understand what it was. And interest in the chemical began to grow. Soon, Du Pont was making millions of kilograms of Teflon each year. Plunkett had made a mistake. But he was able to turn his mistake into great success.\nVoice 2\nFor Dr. West and the Museum of Failure, all of these failures are not just interesting stories. They teach us how to deal with our own failures. They can help us do better at our jobs. And they can make us better people. He writes about this on the Museum of Failure webpage:\nVoice 3\n“The museum’s goal is to say, “Hey, let us not forget these failures. Let’s put them on display. Let us shine a spotlight on these failures. Then, we can talk about them. Then, we can learn from them.”\nVoice 1\nDo you remember a time when you failed at something? What did you learn from it?

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3 \n“Once I knew only darkness and stillness. My life was without past or future. But a little word from the fingers of another person fell into my empty hand. And then my heart suddenly opened to the wonder of living.”\nVoice 1 \nHelen Adams Keller wrote these hopeful words. Her childhood was dark and silent. Yet she became an encouraging writer and teacher for many people. Today’s Spotlight is on the writer and educator Helen Keller.\nVoice 2 \nHelen Keller was born in 1880 in the United States. She was a healthy baby. But Helen became very sick when she was one and a half years old. No one knew what kind of sickness she had. Now, experts think she may have had scarlet fever or meningitis. Her sickness was very serious. Her family believed that Helen was going to die.\nVoice 1 \nHelen did not die. She seemed to recover from her sickness. Her family was very happy. But all was not well. Helen’s mother saw that Helen’s behaviour had changed. Helen did not react to noise. She did not react to movement either. When Helen’s mother placed her hand in front of Helen’s eyes, Helen did not move. She could not see. She could not hear. The sickness had left Helen blind and deaf.\nVoice 2 \nLife for Helen and her family was difficult. Helen became a troublesome child. She smashed things in the house. She was angry. She was intelligent but she had no way to communicate. By the time she was six years old, Helen’s family needed a new way to help her. They travelled to an institute for the blind. Doctors there said that Helen would never see or hear again. But the director of the institute told them not to lose hope. He said that Helen could learn. She only needed a teacher.\nVoice 1 \nThis teacher was Anne Sullivan. Anne was a 20 year old student at the institute for the blind. Anne had lost most of her eyesight at the age of five. At the institute for the blind she had operations on her eyes. Then she could see better. Anne went to live with the Keller family as Helen’s teacher. Later, Helen wrote:\nVoice 3 \n“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.”\nVoice 2 \nAnne changed Helen’s life. She showed Helen love and support. Helen began to trust Anne. Soon Helen’s behavior improved. Anne also began to teach Helen words. Anne used her finger to write the letters of words on Helen’s hand. Helen repeated the finger movements. But she did not understand the meaning of the letters and words.\nVoice 1 \nThen, a small event changed Helen forever. One day, Helen and Anne were walking outside. They passed a water well. Anne took Helen’s hands. On one hand she wrote the letters w – a – t – e – r. On the other hand, she poured cool water. Suddenly, Helen understood the meaning of the word water. She now understood the symbols of language.\nVoice 2 \nAfter this, Helen wanted to know more and more. Anne continued to teach her words and their meanings. Soon Anne taught Helen to read and write. Helen did this through her sense of touch. People were very surprised that Helen could read, write and communicate! This was not common for blind people in the 1800s. But Helen did not ever give up. She wrote:\nVoice 3 \n“When we do the best we can, we never know what miracle is made in our life, or in the life of another.”\nVoice 1 \nIn 1900 Helen went to Radcliff College, in England. Helen became the first deaf and blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. At college Helen also began to write about her life. Helen wrote many books. Some of the books were about her life. Other books were about her Christian faith. Much of her writing was political.\nVoice 2 \nHelen Keller saw that many blind people lived in poor conditions. Blind people did not get a good education. But Helen showed that it is possible for blind people to live happy, productive lives. She wrote,\nVoice 3 \n“The public must learn that the blind man has a mind that can be educated. He has a hand that can be trained. He has dreams that are right for him to work towards.”\nVoice 1 \nHelen was also very interested in justice for blind people in other countries. She travelled to 40 countries around the world. She gave speeches and brought hope to many people. The communities that Helen Keller visited increased their efforts for blind people.\nVoice 2 \nHelen did not only work for justice for blind people. She did not like injustice of any kind.

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nIt was July the 25th, 1865. Doctor James Barry was dead. He had been one of the best doctors in the British Army. He had risen to a high position in the military. Now his body would be buried. But the woman preparing his body was about to be very shocked. When she removed his clothes, she discovered that Doctor Barry was not a man. Doctor Barry was, in fact, a woman.\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight program is on the amazing story of Doctor Barry. By acting like a man, she was able to become a doctor. And as a doctor, she saved many lives and achieved great success.\nVoice 1 \nSo who was Doctor Barry? Well, she was born over 200 years ago – as Margaret Bulkley. Her father owned a small business in Ireland. When Margaret was young, the family began to have money problems. Margaret’s father could not pay his debts. So officials sent him to prison\nVoice 2 \nAfter that, Margaret and her mother had almost no money. So they travelled to London.  They hoped to find work and make enough money to keep them alive.\nVoice 1 \nMargaret wrote letters to her mother’s brother.  She asked him for help. She hoped her uncle would help her achieve an education. Sadly, he was not very kind to her. But, after his death, some of his friends were kind. They helped Margaret get an education.  And she was an excellent student.\nVoice 2 \nIt is unclear exactly what happened next. But together, Margaret, her mother and her uncle’s friends prepared a plan. They decided Margaret would study to become a doctor. But, at that time in Britain, only men could become doctors. So Margaret would need to make people think she was a man.\nVoice 1 \nThis was a major decision. Margaret would have to lie.  She could not tell anyone her secret. Margaret decided that being a doctor was worth it. So Margaret put away her young woman’s clothes. And she began to wear the clothes of a young man. She and her mother left London. They sailed to Scotland where no one knew them. There, Margaret would start medical school.\nVoice 2 \nMargaret would no longer be Margaret Bulkley. Instead, she called herself James Barry – the name of her dead uncle. Only three other people knew Margaret Bulkley’s secret. And these friends provided money and support for her medical studies.\nVoice 1 \nWhen Margaret finished medical school, she joined the British Army. There, she became a great surgeon. She skilfully operated on people’s bodies. And she saved many lives.\nVoice 2 \nAround the year 1815, the Army sent Doctor Barry to serve in South Africa.  There she made medical history. She became the first British surgeon to perform a Caesarian section. Doctor Barry performed this operation on a woman unable to give birth naturally. She cut open the mother’s stomach and removed the baby. Both the mother and baby survived. The mother named the baby boy James Barry, to honour the skilled doctor.\nVoice 1 \nDoctor Barry also worked hard to improve living conditions wherever she served. In South Africa she discovered the cause of Cape Town’s bad water. And she worked to get a better water system.\nVoice 2 \nDoctor Barry also used her power to reform the medical system. She made new rules so that only trained people could give out medicines to patients. She also introduced changes for patients in hospitals – like receiving better food and fresh air. And Doctor Barry improved care for soldiers and their families.\nVoice 1 \nDoctor Barry cared well for sick people and soldiers. However, she did not always have good relationships with her Army chiefs. She often got into trouble. When war broke out in Eastern Europe she made a request. She asked to serve in the Crimean War. But her chiefs said No.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, she went without their approval. There she met Florence Nightingale. Nightingale was a nurse. She achieved great honour for her work with injured soldiers. But James Barry and Florence Nightingale did not like each other. Barry often got angry quickly. And she often shouted at people. Florence Nightingale later wrote:\nVoice 3 \n“I say she was the hardest creature I ever met in the whole Army.”\nVoice 1 \nBut Florence Nightingale and the Army officers never imagined Doctor Barry’s secret. Doctor Barry had a smooth face and high voice, but she acted like a man. She hid her female body under extra clothes. And she did a job that only men did. So no one suspected she was a woman.  She kept her secret for fifty years … until the day she died.\nVoice 2 \nBut even then some mystery remained. The woman who discovered James Barry’s secret did not tell people immediately. She waited until Doctor Barry’s body was buried. So no one could prove if she was telling the truth.\nVoice 1 \nThe British Army denied that James Barry was a man. They closed Doctor Barry’s Army records for one hundred years. They did not let anyone see them. Many people talked about Doctor Barry’s story, but there was no evidence. Was the woman telling the truth or had she made up the story? No one knew for sure … until 2009.\nVoice 2 \nAt this time, a South African doctor began researching Doctor Barry. This doctor’s name was Michael du Preez. And he found evidence that Doctor Barry was a woman. Doctor du Preez found letters. Some were written by Margaret Bulkley. And others were written by James Barry. These letters were tested by hand writing experts. And the writing in all the letters was the same. The letters proved that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were the same person.\nVoice 1 \nMost history books state that Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was the first female doctor in England.  And they state that she became a doctor in 1865. But Doctor du Preez’s research shows that Anderson was not Britain’s first female doctor. Instead, that honour goes to Margaret Bulkley – a poor, young woman from Ireland who secretly achieved that record, over 50 years earlier.\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Alan Harris.  The producer was Luke Haley.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a painting of two women. They have the same face. But one is wearing a white European-style dress. The other wears a traditional Mexican skirt. You can see both of their hearts. And a single blood vein connects them. The woman in the white dress has cut a vein with scissors. Her dress is stained with blood. The women are holding hands. Behind them, there are dark clouds, like a coming storm.\nVoice 2\nThis is a painting called The Two Fridas, by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. This is a painting of herself. She painted it after she and her husband divorced. It symbolizes the pain and longing of this lost relationship. Kahlo often painted herself. But she did not just paint what she could see. Her painting expressed what she felt, with symbols. Using these symbols, she was able to paint about disability, love, and the traditional Mexican life. She is still an important artist today. Today’s Spotlight is on Frida Kahlo.\nVoice 1\nFrida Kahlo was born in Mexico, in 1907. She began painting when she was very young. But she did not think of it as a job. Instead, she wanted to be a doctor. She even attended school to become a doctor. But when she was 18, she was in an accident. Kahlo was riding on a bus. The bus driver crashed into an electric train, going full speed. The crash hurt Kahlo very badly. She broke her legs, foot, pelvis, and collar bone. Worst of all, a metal rail speared her through the stomach. It shattered parts of her spine. And it made it so she could not have children. Because of the crash, she lived in pain for the rest of her life.\nVoice 2\nLater, Kahlo would paint about her pain. One of the most famous of these paintings is called Broken Column. It is another self-portrait. In it, she is naked from the waist up. Small, white tears fall from her eyes. All over her body, nails stick out from her skin, though there is no blood. But this is not the strangest part. From her neck to her waist, there is a huge gash. It looks as if it has been left by an earthquake. Inside the gash is a tall, stone column. It is like those that hold up old houses. And the column is broken into pieces. A yellow desert stretches off behind her.\nVoice 1\nThe crash destroyed Kahlo’s body. She would never be a doctor. But the crash also gave her time to paint. And, in 1928, she met Diego Rivera. Rivera was a famous Mexican painter. He painted murals. In making a mural, a person paints directly onto a wall. Rivera’s murals were very large, public pieces. They showed the indigenous people of Mexico and industrial workers. Kahlo asked Rivera what he thought of her painting. He wrote later about that first meeting with Kahlo. He said her paintings: “had a deep honesty, and an artistic personality of their own.” He said it was clear “that this girl was a true artist.”\nVoice 2\nRivera encouraged Kahlo’s painting. And soon, they fell in love. They married in 1929. Together, Kahlo and Rivera traveled the world, painting. But the marriage was not easy. Both of them had many affairs. They often lived apart. They divorced, and re-married. But they also loved each other deeply. Once, Kahlo wrote to Rivera in a letter:\nVoice 3\n“Nothing compares to your hands. Nothing is like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from you.”\nVoice 1\nMany of Kahlo’s paintings are about their troubled relationship. In 1943, she painted Diego on my Mind. It is another self-portrait. In this painting, she wears a traditional Tehuana costume. This white robe wraps around her like a butterfly’s chrysalis. Strange, white threads stretch out from her body. It is like they are holding her in place. And on her forehead is a picture of Rivera. Kahlo painted this after their divorce. It shows that, even though they were apart, she was still thinking of him.\nVoice 2\nKahlo did not find immediate success as a painter. Rivera helped her meet many people. And after a time, she began to show her paintings in galleries. But many people did not take her seriously. They did not believe her art was there because of her skill. They believed she found success because her husband was famous. In 1938, Kahlo went to New York. She had her first solo exhibition. The gallery only displayed her paintings. But the news media did not treat her with respect. A writer for Time Magazine saw the exhibition. He said that Kahlo’s paintings were weak. He did not like the bright colors. And he compared her paintings to ideas of a child.\nVoice 1\nBut soon, people began to recognize Kahlo’s work. The Louvre is a famous art museum in Paris, France. In 1939, the museum bought one of Kahlo’s Paintings. The painting was called The Frame. The Louvre had never purchased a painting by a Mexican artist before. It was a great achievement for her to be the first. Other artists also encouraged Kahlo. André Breton was a French writer. He called her art “a ribbon around a bomb”. He helped her find places to show her work.\nVoice 2\nBut Kahlo was most famous in her native country, Mexico. This is partly because she used images from Mexican culture. For example, one of her paintings is called The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl. The painting shows the universe as a mother. This woman holds Kahlo and Rivera in her arms. From those arms grow the plants of Mexico. The painting also shows Cihuacoatl  holding her. Cihuacoatl is a goddess from Aztec stories. The Aztecs were one of the original peoples of Mexico. And Cihuacoatl was their mother goddess. By including Cihuacoatl, Kahlo shows a motherly love for her husband. But she also shows that her mother is Mexico. It is the thing that gives her life.\nVoice 1\nJust as Kahlo was becoming more famous, she began to get sick. Her health was always bad. But it began to get much worse. The pain in her back made it so she could not stand or sit long. In 1953, doctors removed one of her legs after an infection. She lived either in a bed or a wheelchair. And she abused medicine to manage her pain. Later in the next year, she got sick from pneumonia. This made it hard for her to breathe. She had a terrible fever and was in a lot of pain. She died in 1954. She was only 47 years old.\nVoice 2\nIn the years since she has died, Frida Kahlo has become very famous. Her paintings are world-famous. In 1984, the Mexican Government even declared that her paintings were part of their national heritage. Women celebrate her for her fearless images of female life. But more than anything, people remember her for her talent and special vision. As Rivera once wrote to the Spanish Painter Pablo Picasso:\nVoice 4\n“I recommend her to you, not as a husband, but as an admirer of her work. It is acid and tender. It is hard as steel and fragile as a butterfly’s wing. It is as lovable as a beautiful smile, and as cruel as the bitterness of life.”\nVoice 1\nHave you ever seen a painting by Frida Kahlo?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThis program is about a very famous artist. But it is also about his mental illness. It mentions suicide. If you are thinking about suicide, please call a crisis center in your area.\nVoice 2\nYou have probably seen this painting before. It is a painting of a night sky. Stars shine over a small village. The moon glows yellow. But this is no ordinary painting. Swirls of white and blue fill the sky. Each star is as big as a sun. It is clearly a real sky. But the way it is painted makes it a mystery. There is some kind of magic in that sky. But you do not know how it got there, or why.\nVoice 1\nThis painting is called The Starry Night and it is by the artist Vincent Van Gogh. He lived during the 1800s, in the Netherlands. Some people say that Van Gogh was a genius. He influenced many artists who came after him. But Van Gogh was also unwell. He suffered from mental illness all his life. He died without much money, at a very young age. Few people knew about Van Gogh when he was alive. But today, he is one of the most well-known artists in the world. Today’s Spotlight is on the life and illness of Vincent Van Gogh.\nVoice 2\nVincent Van Gogh was born in 1853, in the Netherlands. His family was wealthy. Many of them were art dealers. Some were Christian preachers. When he was young, Van Gogh did not impress many people. He had mood swings. Sometimes he was very happy, and sometimes he was very sad. These emotions were very strong. They often annoyed family and friends. He was not able to control these emotions. And the people who loved him did not know what to do.\nVoice 1\nAs he grew up, Van Gogh did not know what to do with his life. For a time, he was an art dealer. But he was restless and quit after a year. Then, he wanted to become a preacher. But the church did not accept him. He often lived without much money. And he sometimes lived on money that his parents gave him.\nVoice 2\nVan Gogh did very badly when it came to practical things. But he soon discovered that he was very good at making art. He began to draw and paint constantly. He believed painting was his calling. He believed he was born to paint.\nVincent Van Gogh and his younger brother, Theo\nVoice 1\nVan Gogh had a brother, named Theo. Theo was an art dealer in Paris, France. He believed his brother was a great artist. So he funded Van Gogh’s art. Later, Theo invited Vincent to live with him in Paris. Living in Paris was very important to Van Gogh. That was where many other interesting artists lived. There, he was able to talk to and learn from them. It helped him become a better artist. There, he created his own style.\nVoice 2\nBut Paris was also where Van Gogh’s mental illness really began. He had always been very emotional. Often, he was very depressed. He abused alcohol. He especially drank an alcohol called absinthe. But in Paris, things began to get worse. Sometimes, he would become terrified for no reason. At other times, he would lose consciousness. He would forget where he was.\nVoice 1\nAfter a few years, Van Gogh tried to leave Paris. He found a house in a town called Arles. He hoped leaving Paris would help him get better. Instead, it made things worse.\nVoice 2\nPaul Gauguin was a famous artist. He lived with Van Gogh in Arles. Van Gogh admired Gauguin. He wanted to work with Gauguin. But Gauguin began to dislike Van Gogh. They fought often. Van Gogh told his brother, Theo:\nVoice 3\n“Our argument is at times full of energy, like with electricity. At times, we end up with tired and empty heads. It is like an electric battery after discharge.”\nVoice 1\nSoon, Gauguin told Van Gogh that he was leaving. This changed something in Van Gogh. Gauguin was very important to Van Gogh’s plans. He did not know how to deal with the change. Later that day, he approached Gauguin with a razor blade. Van Gogh did not hurt him. But Gauguin felt threatened. He left soon after. That night, Van Gogh began to hear voices, even though he was alone. They tortured him. To make them quiet, he picked up the same razor blade. He cut his own ear off! Then, he went to a brothel. He gave his ear to a prostitute. Then, he disappeared.\nVoice 2\nWhen the police finally found Van Gogh, they put him in a mental institution. There, doctors tried to treat him. They believed that he had epilepsy. Epilepsy is a disease that causes fits. During these fits, people lose control of their bodies. But it can also give people hallucinations where they see and hear things that are not there.\nVoice 1\nSoon, Van Gogh began to recover. He stopped drinking alcohol. And he started taking medication. He left the mental institution. And he began to paint again. During this time, Van Gogh made some of his most well-known paintings, like the painting described at the beginning of the program. He painted similar things to other artists, like flowers and fields. But the way he painted was very different. He did not just paint these things. He painted what he felt about them. And he used colors in ways no one had seen before. People began to recognize his works.\nAn interpretation of Van Gogh’s The Bedroom; Image by johnnyjohnson20430 from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nBut Van Gogh’s mental illness did not go away. He had several mental breakdowns. He went back to institution several times. He hallucinated and feared being poisoned. And he was often very depressed. He did not feel like a success. He wrote to his brother, Theo:\nVoice 3\n“I am so angry with myself because I cannot do what I should like to do. At such a moment I feel that I am lying at the bottom of a deep dark well. I feel completely helpless.”\nVoice 1\nVan Gogh’s mental illness was very painful for him. One day, it became too much. He went out into a field with a gun. He shot himself in the chest. He did not die. Later that day, he went to his friend’s home. He was bleeding from the chest. Van Gogh died two days later. He had committed suicide. He was only 37.\nVoice 2\nAfter Van Gogh died, his paintings quickly became famous. Museums began to display them. Art collectors bought them for a lot of money. Newspaper editors called him a genius. He influenced other famous painters like Henri Matisse. Today, Van Gogh is one of the most well-known painters in the world.\nVoice 1\nBut for all this, we will never really know what illness Vincent Van Gogh had. Some scholars agree that he had epilepsy. Others believe he had bipolar disorder. People with this disease have extreme periods of depression. But they also have moments of high activity, or mania. A manic person often feels afraid of imaginary things. He may hear people speaking that are not there.\nVoice 2\nBoth of these diseases seem to describe Van Gogh. But there are many other theories. Many people even think he was such a good painter because of his mental illness. They believe his strange colors were because of madness. Or they believe his swinging emotions pushed him to paint. This may be true. But these things also pushed him to his death. He felt so strongly and loved what he did. He fought through many years of difficulty, and changed the world of art. But Van Gogh did not see this. He died thinking he had failed. Before he died, he told his brother:\nVoice 3\n“If I could have worked without this terrible disease, what things I might have done.” \nOrchard Bordered by Cypresses (1888) by Vincent Van Gogh. Original from the Yale University Art Gallery. Digitally enhanced by rawpixel.\nVoice 1\nMental illness can be very serious. If you or anyone you know feels suicidal, please find help. There are many options for help. You can call a suicide hotline in your country. Or talk to a friend and ask them for help. More than anything, you should know that you are not alone. You should know that you can get better.\nVoice 2\nHave you ever seen a painting by Vincent Van Gogh? What was your experience like? You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3\n“Art is, and always was, at the service of man. Our ancestors created their myths and told their stories for a human purpose. Any good story, any good novel, should have a message. It should have a purpose.”\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nThese words are from Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe. As a young man Achebe grew up in Igbo Nigerian culture. He saw the beauty and deep tradition of African people. But, when he looked at popular culture he saw something different. Some films and books from around the world showed African people as foolish or stupid. Achebe believed this was very wrong. He believed it was bad for African people. And in fact, it was bad for the world. Today’s Spotlight is on Chinua Achebe.\nVoice 2\nMany people consider Chinua Achebe to be the ‘father of modern African literature.’ That is, he began a very important movement. He affected all of Africa with the novels, or books, he wrote.\nVoice 1\nAchebe was born in Nigeria in 1930. His full name was Albert Chinualumogu Achebe. His parents named him in honor of Prince Albert, in England. Achebe’s father was a teacher in a missionary school. And his parents were strong Christians. But they also taught him many values of the surrounding traditional Igbo culture.\nVoice 2\nAchebe was a skilled student. At university he studied English, history, and theology, or faith. He also studied broadcasting. At university, Achebe also rejected his given British name, Albert. Instead he took his middle name – an African name – Chinua. After university Achebe travelled in Africa and America. He also worked in radio and was a teacher.\nVoice 1\nBut in 1958 Achebe made a permanent mark on the world. He wrote a book called “Things Fall Apart.” Today this book appears in more than 50 languages. It has sold more than 11 million copies. This book began a new kind of writing about Africa.\nThings Fall Apart\nVoice 2\n“Things Fall Apart” is the story of a very successful African man. His name is Okonkwo. In the story, Okonkwo is a leader in his village. But after a terrible accident, he must leave his village. “Things Fall Apart” tells about Okonkwo’s life. It tells Okonkwo’s religious beliefs and his traditions. It tells about his children, and the way the people in his village live.\nVoice 1\nThis seems like a very normal story. And it is a very normal story. That is why it is so important. The characters in the book are very real.  Achebe showed the world what African people really felt, and said, and how they acted. This was a very new way to write stories about any African people.\nVoice 2\nAchebe writes stories about Africa for a particular reason. For a long time, Achebe was interested in language. He listened to the people around him in Nigeria. They loved language. He heard them speak with “great eloquence.” They spoke beautifully. But Achebe did not see the same sort of eloquence and beauty from African people in modern literature of the time.\nVoice 1\nA popular writer of the time was Joseph Conrad. One of his most famous books is called “Heart of Darkness.” He wrote it in 1902. The story tells of a European man and his travels in parts of Africa. In those days many Europeans called Africa ‘the dark continent.’ Many believed that African people were not intelligent. They looked at them like animals. They believed the ceremonies and traditions of the Africans were foolish, and even evil. Some people believed that Joseph Conrad’s book showed Africans in this way.\nVoice 2\nAchebe tells about the longest group of words said by an African character in ‘Heart of Darkness.’ The character says only eight words. And he is not very eloquent. The African man says: “Catch him! Give him to us! … Eat him.” The African man who says this is a cannibal. He is looking for someone to eat. In other parts of the novel this man does not even speak. He shouts in high tones like an angry bird and makes animal noises.\nVoice 1\nAchebe saw this short speech as an insult to the people of Africa. So, he wanted to do something different. In an interview with Lorene Cary at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Achebe tells why he wanted to write a book about his people. He says:\nVoice 3\nThe people I was writing about wanted their story told. They people of my village wanted their story told. I wanted my story told. I was very young, but I had begun to read other people’s stories. And I was beginning to wonder: where was mine?”\nVoice 2\nAchebe believed that no one had told the real story of the real people of Africa. Africans in literature did not seem human. These stories lacked the beautiful language Achebe heard around him. And he felt that taking away this language took worth away from Africans. He told Lorene Cary,\nVoice 3\n“When I am talking about my story, giving me back my story, I mean giving Africans back the story in which we are human. No matter how damaged or bad we are as humans. We cannot give language to some people and take it away from others. … That is what “Things Fall Apart” is about. What I say must be true. I cannot act as if the Africans I am writing about are angels – that they are perfect. They are not. I have to say that they are human… I lived in the village and I knew the people of the village. They were not people without language.”\nChinua Achebe speaking in 2008; Stuart C. Shapiro, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1\nAchebe’s books test old ways of thinking about African people. He believes that language and literature greatly influence people. In the past, bad representations of Africa and Africans influenced people all around the world. These bad representations even influenced Africans themselves. They started to believe they were not as modern or as good as white European cultures. But Achebe writes books to show the African cultures as they really are. He educates foreign readers. And he encourages African readers. He helps his people understand how valuable their culture is.\nVoice 2\nThrough the years, Achebe has written many novels, essays, and poems. And he has received many literature awards. His writings have influenced and inspired people all over the world. \nVoice 1\nYou can read “Things Fall Apart” in English.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \n\nClick here to follow along with this program on Youtube.\nWe are going to ask a shocking question right now. Would you ever kill someone? Wait, do not say “no” immediately. Think about it. What if someone was threatening your family? What if your country were being attacked? What if you could save millions of lives by taking only one? Would you kill then?\nVoice 2 \nEthics is the debate over how people should act. Sometimes this debate takes place in school – as a theory. Other times these debates take place in the middle of a person’s life. People need to decide what is best and what to do. Today’s Spotlight is on a real ethics question that one man faced. We tell the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and how he tried to help kill another man.\nVoice 1 \nIn 1931, Dietrich Bonhoeffer completed his studies to become a church leader in Germany. He taught and wrote books. But Germany was changing all around him. The Nazi political party was rising to power and Adolf Hitler was taking control of the country. To get more control, Hitler only permitted the state-approved church. Other churches were closed. Hitler began to tell people that their first loyalty belonged to the nation of Germany, not to God.\nVoice 2 \nBonhoeffer disagreed with this. He believed this was not good Christian teaching. He became part of a group of 2000 church leaders who formed the Pastors Emergency League. They opposed the state-approved Nazi church. When pressure from the government increased, this group changed. They became the illegal Confessing Church. The Confessing Church believed that Christians should follow God first, not the nation or Hitler. Bonhoeffer served as the head of the Confessing Church’s school.\nBonhoeffer with a group of students; Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-R0211-316 / CC-BY-SA 3.0, CC BY-SA 3.0 DE https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/deed.en, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nBonhoeffer was a pacifist. He believed that violence is never the solution to any problem. A pacifist works to make change, but through protest and talking together. But Bonhoeffer began to hear stories of Jewish people being killed and his ideas changed. He decided that pacifism was a good theory, but to not act was to act. If he did not act, he was letting Hitler win. If he did nothing to fight the evil he saw, he was supporting the evil.\nVoice 2 \nSo Bonhoeffer joined a group working to fight Nazism. He was still permitted to travel outside the country. He took secret information to Great Britain. He tried to gather support for the Confessing Church and tell the world that not every German supported Hitler.\nVoice 1 \nBonhoeffer did have the chance to escape from Germany completely. He could have stayed in a safe place. He was permitted to travel to New York City. But after only a few weeks, he decided to return to Germany. He knew that if he was going to help fix the country he loved, he would have to stay during the struggle for the heart of Germany.\nVoice 2 \nSo he went home. He could not support Hitler’s government. But he could not do nothing. He believed that killing was wrong, but he also believed it was wrong not to help people in trouble. During this time, he spent a lot of time thinking and writing about the correct thing to do as a Christian. After a time, he decided to join a group planning to kill Adolf Hitler. But the attempt failed. Bonhoeffer was one of the people who was caught. The German government arrested him and put him in prison.\nImage by Ichigo121212 from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nIn prison, Bonhoeffer wrote many letters and documents. Some of these explained how he decided to join the group trying to kill Hitler. He said that there are two things that should guide Christians through life. The first is the needs of the people around you. In this case, these were the millions of people Hitler was killing.\nVoice 2 \nThe second thing that should guide Christians is the model of Jesus Christ. Jesus has a group of teachings called “The Beatitudes”. These teachings concentrate on the poor, those who are sad, and those who suffer. Bonhoeffer believed that Christians should remember these two things when trying to make a difficult choice.\nVoice 1 \nBonhoeffer attempted to follow Jesus. He saw suffering people and acted. He stood up for poor and hurting people. Because he lived this belief, the government sentenced him to death. The prison doctor watched as Bonhoeffer was killed. He described what he saw:\nVoice 3 \n“The prisoners were taken from their cells. The judgments were read out to them. Through the open door in one room, I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer. He was on the floor praying to his God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed. He believed and was so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a prayer. Then he climbed the steps to the gallows. He was brave and calm. He died in a few seconds. In the almost 50 years that I have worked as a doctor, I have never seen a man die so completely accepting of the will of God.”\nMemorial plaque on the house where Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born; Bonio, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nThere are many Christians who would have encouraged Bonhoeffer to find a non–violent form of protest. But many would say that his actions are different from other acts of violence. That is because he was moved by Jesus Christ’s command to help the poor and the suffering and those who cannot help themselves.\nVoice 1 \nDietrich Bonhoeffer was not trying to tell people that all acts of violence are good as long as you feel God is behind you. Instead, he was one man in one situation trying to decide what was best. He was not sure he was doing the right thing. He had doubt and worry that he was wrong. But he was willing to accept the results of his actions, both for his body and for his soul.\nVoice 2 \nWe began this program by asking if you would ever kill someone. Now, put yourself in Bonhoeffer’s position. If you had the chance to kill a single person and save the lives of millions of people, would you do it? If you say “no” then what would you do? Nothing?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nOn the 7th of January 1943, an old man died. He was in a room at the New Yorker Hotel.  The man had lived alone in this hotel room for the past ten years. Outside, the city of New York was full of lights. These lights were the result of an idea the old man had had many years before. This man was once famous for his idea. But many people had forgotten about the old man. No one seemed to care. The man died alone and with very little money. He was the great inventor Nikola Tesla.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nTesla was an extremely intelligent man. He had many new scientific ideas – ideas that would change the world. One writer called Tesla “The Man Who Invented the Twentieth Century.” However, many people do not know the name Nikola Tesla. Why is this? Today’s Spotlight is on the life and work of Nikola Tesla.\nVoice 1 \nNikola Tesla was born on the 10th of July 1856. He was from what is now the country of Croatia. His father was a priest. His mother was an inventor. She invented and made tools for her house work.\nVoice 2 \nFrom a very young age, Tesla was interested in electricity. At this time, scientists had discovered electricity. However, they were still trying to understand how to best use it. As a young boy, Tesla had a dream or goal. He knew about the great waterfall, Niagara Falls, in the United States. At Niagara Falls, a large river flows over a cliff. It drops more than 50 meters! Tesla wanted to turn this great waterfall into electricity. This was not a normal dream for a young boy. But Tesla was not a normal boy!\nNiagara Falls; Image by Jeff Leonhardt from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nTesla was a very good student. He was particularly good at mathematics and language learning. In fact, Tesla knew six languages! Tesla studied at many different universities. However, he did not have the money to finish his studies.\nVoice 2 \nIn 1881, one of the first telephone exchanges opened in Europe. It was in Budapest. Tesla moved there and got a job. It was here that Tesla first thought of the idea that would become his greatest invention. It was the alternating current or AC induction motor.\nVoice 1 \nIn 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America. He went to work for Thomas Edison. Edison was also a great inventor. He too was experimenting with how to best transport the power of electricity. But Tesla worked for Edison for less than a year. Tesla was sure his AC motor was the best way to capture and transport the power of electricity. However, Edison thought his way of using direct current or DC was better. Edison thought that AC was not safe. He did all he could to stop Tesla from developing his idea.\nVoice 2 \nHowever, a wealthy investor and engineer named George Westinghouse decided to support Tesla. Westinghouse helped Tesla get patents. These official papers kept other people from copying Tesla’s many ideas. Soon, the scientific community accepted Tesla’s way of using AC to capture and transport electricity. It was more powerful than DC and it was proved safe.\nVoice 1 \nIn 1895, Tesla achieved his childhood dream. He designed the first hydroelectric power plant using the energy of the Niagara Falls.  And he did it using the AC motor. This achievement ended Tesla’s long battle with Edison. Tesla had won. Today, AC is the way electricity is transported all over the world. In fact, without it, you would not be able to listen to this programme.\nVoice 2 \nAfter the success of AC, Tesla became well-known. He travelled and spoke to many scientists about his inventions and ideas. Tesla also liked to demonstrate his ideas for crowds of people. He built a large laboratory where he did amazing things with lights and electricity. He would produce large lightning bolts, like the bright lights in a storm. And he used electricity to produce light without any wires.\nA Tesla coil producing electricity; Image by Hans Braxmeier from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nTesla was a very interesting man. He was over six feet tall and was very good looking. He had many famous friends, including the great American writer Mark Twain. He liked to wear nice clothes. He also enjoyed eating food at the best restaurants.\nVoice 2 \nBut many people thought Tesla was a little bit strange. He always counted things. He also liked to put things in order. For example, he would organize a group of glasses by size before he drank from them. Tesla also had an unusual interest in pigeons. Tesla loved these large birds which are common in New York.\nVoice 1 \nIn March of 1895, Tesla’s laboratory burned down. He had to start much of his research all over again. Tesla continued to invent and think of new ideas. But he was less successful and famous.\nVoice 2 \nMany people did not recognize that particular inventions were really Tesla’s ideas. For example, people usually think of Guglielmo Marconi as the inventor of radio. However, Marconi used many of Tesla’s ideas about long distance radio in his work. Tesla argued that Marconi was not the real inventor of radio. And after Tesla’s death, the United States courts decided that Marconi did use Tesla’s ideas. But by this time people had forgotten about the debate. Tesla also achieved important inventions in other areas. He did important work on medical x-rays, remote control and wireless technology.\nTesla as a young man; Image by Gordon Johnson from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nAs Tesla got older, he continued to invent new ideas and theories. But he also became more and more sad. People like George Westinghouse no longer gave money to support him. Many people did not understand Tesla’s new ideas. He gave speeches about creating electrical power from the earth’s atmosphere. He also talked about ways that wireless electricity and communication could power things all over the world! Now, some people say Tesla’s ideas were ‘ahead of his time.’ To the people of his time, these ideas sounded insane. However, some of his ideas are supported by modern research and technology.\nVoice 2 \nTesla’s last years were lonely and sad. He received many awards, but received very little money for this work. He lived alone in a hotel room. His best friends were the pigeons he loved so much. When he died in 1943, he was no longer famous. He felt forgotten. Today, not many people know the name of Nikola Tesla. But his inventions and ideas affect our lives every day!\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this programme was Shelagh Godwin. The producer was Luke Haley.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIt was a sunny day on the East coast of the United States. Joni Eareckson Tada was 17 years old. She was standing by a lake. Tada began a strong dive into the water. She did not know that in a moment her life would change forever. Today’s Spotlight is on the amazing life of Joni Eareckson Tada.\nVoice 2 \nTada dove head-first into the lake. But the water was not deep. She hit her head on the bottom of the lake. She heard a loud quick noise. After that, she could not move. Tada was trapped under the water. She wanted to call for help. But she could not open her mouth under the water. No matter how hard she tried, Tada could not get up. She did not understand what was happening. She was holding her breath. But she could not last much longer under the water.\nJoni before the accident, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nFinally, Tada’s sister, Kathy, pulled her out of the water. Tada could finally breathe. But she still could not move her arms or legs. An emergency vehicle brought Tada to the hospital. She was very frightened. She asked Kathy to hold her hand while they were waiting. Kathy told Tada that she was already doing that. Tada was surprised. She could not feel her sister’s hand.\nVoice 2 \nAt the hospital, doctors discovered that Tada had broken an important bone in her neck. She was now a quadriplegic. She could not feel or move any part of her body below her shoulders. And this condition would never change. Tada was in the hospital for a long time. She thought she would probably die. She did not die. But her life, as she knew it, had changed completely.\nVoice 1 \nTada experienced intense depression for a long time. At first, she could not accept what had happened to her. She thought it was unfair that she would never move her body again. She was angry that her life had changed so much. She wanted to die. She wrote about her experiences:\nVoice 3 \n“I asked many of my friends to assist me in suicide. I wanted to find a final escape. I could not face the possibility of sitting down for the rest of my life without the use of my hands, without the use of my legs. All my hopes seemed destroyed.”\nVoice 2 \nBut then Tada began to have more hopeful thoughts. She was a Christian. Before the accident, she felt like she was not living her life very well. She had prayed that God would change her. She wanted to be a better person. And now, after months of depression Tada had a new idea. She wondered if the accident might have been God’s answer to her prayer. Tada began to study the Christian Bible. She read what God teaches about pain, suffering, and healing. Tada says:\nVoice 3 \n“I have discovered that God can heal. He does heal. But he is not required to heal… He has shown me that my suffering is part of a better plan.”\nJoni begins speaking in public about her accident, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nToday Tada believes that her accident was the beginning of a long and difficult process. It was the process of becoming more like Jesus Christ. Tada writes:\nVoice 3 \n“God used this injury to develop in me patience and endurance and tolerance and self-control and steadfastness and sensitivity and love and joy. Those things did not matter much to me when I was on my feet. But, oh boy, they began to matter after I began living in a wheelchair.”\nVoice 2 \nTada learned that her worth did not depend on being able to move her body. Instead, she could use her situation to help people who were dealing with suffering. And Tada has done this in many ways. She has written over 50 books for people of all ages. Tada learned to paint beautiful pictures. She paints by holding a paintbrush in her mouth! Tada has also worked with government officials to help people with disabilities. She is a singer, a speaker, a writer, an actor, a wife, and an encouragement to many people.\nJoni drawing Christmas Art, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nTada is the president of a group called Joni and Friends. It is a group that helps people with disabilities in many countries. Every day Joni broadcasts a short radio program for Joni and Friends. Her program is broadcast in many different countries. She tries to help people understand pain and suffering. She encourages everyone to work with people with disabilities. Nate Dell works with Spotlight English. He went to see Joni Eareckson Tada at a conference in 2015. He told Spotlight how she changed the way he thinks:\nVoice 4 \n“I had heard of Joni before I ever got to see her speak. Before, her quadriplegia seemed to be just a discussion starter for her message. But Joni parked her chair right beside where I was sitting! And I saw how her disability affects every part of her life. She had two women helping her. They held a water bottle for Joni to drink from. They helped her wipe her nose. They even adjusted her clothing. I do all of these things without even thinking about it! Joni’s message is that God loves us – even through difficult circumstances and suffering. Hearing this message from a wheelchair was very powerful.”\nVoice 2 \nTada has continued to have struggles. She often has problems with her muscles. She feels a lot of pain. In 2010, Tada had treatment for breast cancer. But throughout all these difficulties, Tada kept her trust in God. She says:\nVoice 3 \n“My weakness, that is, my quadriplegia, is my greatest strength. It forces me into the arms of Christ every single morning when I get up.”\nYou can find Joni Eareckson Tada’s song Alone Yet Not Alone on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIn 2014 Tada recorded a song. It became very famous. Over a million people watched the Youtube video of “Alone But Not Alone.” We end today’s program with some words from this song. They show Joni Eareckson Tada’s faith, and the strength it brings her every day of her life.\nVoice 3 \n“I will not be bent in fear.God is the shelter I know is near.In His strength I find my own.By His faithful mercies shown.When my steps are lost and desperate for a guide,I can feel his touch, a soothing presence by my side.I am alone yet not alone.”\nJoni shares her hope, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 2 \nThe writers of this program were Liz Waid and Rena Dam.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIt is four o’clock in the morning. The city is Washington, DC in the United States. Almost everyone in the city is sleeping. The government buildings along the streets are quiet and empty. Few cars are on the roads. And the city is dark. In a home near the middle of the city, a telephone rings. A woman answers. The woman’s name is Peggeliene Bartels.\nVoice 2 \nThe man calling Bartels is a family member.  He is from her family’s village of Otuam – in the country of Ghana. He is calling with some strange news. This telephone call will change Bartels’ life forever.\nVoice 1 \nThe man explains that the village of Otuam needs a new king. And he tells Bartels that local officials have chosen her. Bartels cannot believe it. She is tired. And she thinks it is a joke. But it is not. Today’s Spotlight is on King Peggeliene Bartels, or King Peggy.\nA street in Ghana; Image by jozuadouglas from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nPeggeliene Bartels was born in 1953, in Takoradi, Ghana. As a young adult, she studied in England. When she finished university, she moved to the United States. Bartels began working at the Embassy of Ghana in Washington DC. There, she is a secretary. She answers telephones. She types documents and e-mails. And she serves Embassy officials and visitors. Bartels enjoys her job. She has worked at the Embassy for more than 30 years. And in 1997, Bartels became a United States citizen.\nVoice 1 \nWhile Bartels lived and worked in Washington, DC, her uncle was king of Otuam.  Her mother’s brother ruled the village for many years.  But in 2008, the king died. And leaders in the village had to choose a new king. The leaders suggested names of people that might replace the king.  One person suggested Bartels.  This was an unusual suggestion. Past kings had all been men.\nVoice 2 \nThe village leaders performed a ritual to choose the new leader. This religious tradition involved pouring liquid on the ground and then saying the name of each possible king.  If the liquid quickly evaporated after one of the names, the leaders would choose that person to be king. The ritual confirmed that Bartels should be king. The village leaders were not sure about choosing a woman to be king. So, they performed the ritual three times to be sure. Finally, the leaders agreed.  They would offer the king’s position to Bartels.\nVoice 1 \nWhen Bartels’ family member called, he told her that her uncle had always wanted her to be the next king. Bartels never knew that. And she was not sure if she should accept this new job. She had a job in the United States.  And as king she would be responsible for Otuam’s 7000 villagers.  Bartels thought about the offer for many days.  Soon, she felt like God was telling her to take it. She told the news organization NPR:\nVoice 3\n“When they told me, I was a little afraid to accept it. It comes with responsibilities. And I have a job as a secretary in the United States! I have my own responsibilities and bills to pay! And to become king, you have to be really rich. But then, it was like someone was talking to me. A voice said, ‘Accept it. This is what you are supposed to do. You will have help so you can help your people.’”\nVoice 1 \nSo Peggy Bartels accepted the job of king. People usually only use the term “king” for male leaders. “Queen” is the word for female rulers. But Bartels did not want her people to call her “Queen Peggy.” She wanted them to call her “king”. She told the news organization, CNN:\nVoice 3 \n“Most of the time, a king is the one who has all the power to do things. The queen has power over children’s issues. And the queen reports to the king.”\nVoice 2 \nBartels knew that the term “king” would communicate power. So having this title was important for her. When Bartels told the men she wanted to be called king, they were surprised. She told NPR:\nVoice 3 \n“When I said this, all the men stood up. They said, ‘A woman is speaking like this?’ And I said, ‘Yes, I am serious. Treat me like a man because I am a man… Do not look at me as a woman. If you understand me as a man, then we can move forward. But if you think I am a woman, we are not going to be able to work together.’”\nVoice 1 \nToday, the people of her village respect King Peggy. And she is beginning to change minds. She told NPR:\nVoice 3 \n“They are beginning to accept me for who I am. The women are trying to understand me. They see that as a woman, you can do a lot. You do not have to sit down and wait for a man to succeed in life. If I am a woman and I am doing this, they can also do it.”\n“King Peggy at the Baltimore book festiva” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by Tommy’s Flickr site\nVoice 1 \nKing Peggy has worked hard to improve the lives of people in her village. Since becoming king, she has raised money for the village. This money has helped send children to school. It has helped buy computers for the school classrooms. The village now even has an emergency vehicle!\nVoice 2 \nKing Peggy still lives in the United States. And she still works as a secretary at the Embassy. But she remains connected to her people. She visits Ghana for one month each year. And every day at 1:00 in the morning, she calls her representative in Otuam. This family member tells her everything that is happening in the village.  And he tells the villagers what she says.  King Peggy hopes to move back to Otuam when she retires from her job at the Embassy.\nVoice 1 \nKing Peggy did not expect to become King of Otuam. But now, she believes it is her calling. She has faith that God meant for her to be king. And she believes God gives her strength to lead her people. She told CNN:\nVoice 3 \n“I recognize that we all have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it. Helping my people has really helped me. I know that I can really touch and change their lives. I would have really regretted not accepting this calling.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer and producer of this program was Dianna Anderson.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nMercy and Agnes are sisters from Kenya. They are part of the Maasai tribe. They told their story to the organization Equality Now. When they were 10 and 11 years old, they were supposed to take part in a ceremony. This ceremony would celebrate moving from being a girl to a woman. Ceremonies like this are often beautiful and exciting. But Mercy and Agnes were afraid. They knew that this ceremony would also involve cutting their sexual organs.\nVoice 2  \nMercy and Agnes did not want to go through the ceremony. They decided to run away. They received help from some adults they knew. These adults guided them to Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative, or TNI. Tasaru means “rescue” in the local Maa language. There, they met Agnes Pareyio. Today’s Spotlight is on Agnes Pareyio and her work to end female genital mutilation.\nVoice 1  \nWomen all around the world have experienced female genital mutilation, or FGM. FGM involves cutting a woman’s sexual organs. It can involve a small cut, or completely cutting off a woman’s sexual organs. The World Health Organization estimates that 200 million girls have been cut.\nVoice 2  \nThere are no medical reasons to cut. And FGM often causes severe pain, extreme bleeding, and infections. Some girls even die. Even if the girl lives, FGM can cause problems with her body and in childbirth.\nVoice 1  \nGovernments and organizations internationally recognize that FGM is a violation of human rights. However, FGM still happens in many cultures. For many, it is a cultural tradition. People are often strongly attached to these traditions.\nVoice 2  \nThis is why Agnes Pareyio continues her work. Pareyio comes from the Maasai culture in Kenya. When she was 14, her mother told Agnes she would be cut. Agnes did not want to be cut. Her father supported her. But her village did not support her. They made fun of her and called her names. They said they would never accept her. They said no one would marry her.\nVoice 1  \nSo, Pareyio agreed and had her sex organs cut. She bled a lot and was in a lot of pain. But she did not cry, because she did not want to look like she was afraid. Maasai women are not supposed to show fear. Instead, she felt something else. Pareyio told One Billion Rising:\nVoice 3  \n“As I lay there after being cut, I made myself a promise. I was going to do everything I could to stop this ever happening to another girl. My daughters would not be cut. And the daughters of the Maasai would not be cut.”\nVoice 2  \nThis promise has defined Pareyio’s life. FGM was banned in Kenya in 2011. But it continues there. Pareyio works in Kenya to stop FGM, especially with the Maasai. She founded TNI in 1999. It began as a place where girls who ran away from FGM and early marriages could continue their education. But today, two of TNI’s most important programs deal with protecting girls from FGM.\nVoice 1  \nOne of TNI’s programs involves different ceremonies for girls to become women. As a member of the Maasai tribe, Pareyio knows how culturally important FGM is for many women. She wants to offer another choice that protects young girls from FGM but still honors Maasai traditions. The traditional ceremony for Maasai girls to become women is four days long. The girls dress in their best clothes and wear their most beautiful jewelry. They sing traditional songs, and tribal leaders bless the girls with milk and water. A leader performs FGM on the girls. And at the end of the ceremony, the community welcomes them as women.\nVoice 2  \nThe new ceremonies honor the beauty of the tradition while stopping the FGM. All of the elements of the traditional custom are the same except that the girl is not cut. Instead, the girl receives information about the value of education and health.\nImage by Gordon Turibamwe from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nOther organizations also use this method. They keep the good parts of the ceremony. But they replace the cutting with a symbol. Instead of cutting, leaders pour milk on a girl’s legs to represent how she has become a woman. Sarah Tenoi is another Maasai anti-FGM activist in Kenya. She explains the purpose of these new ceremonies to The Guardian:\nVoice 4  \n“We know that if we can change everyone’s mind then we will end FGM. Our message is that we are encouraging people to change one part of Maasai culture, but not give up all of what makes us proud to be Maasai.”\nVoice 2  \nTNI’s other main program is to reconnect girls to their families. Most of the girls who run away from FGM do not want to stay away from their families forever. So Pareyio and her co-workers decided to use a traditional Maasai reconciliation process to return the girls to their families and their village.\nVoice 1  \nThis process involves meeting with parents, family members, and other members of the community. Village leaders and other officials also become involved. Everyone works together and promises not to force the girls to be cut. It is a village-wide promise to protect and support the girls. And it welcomes the girls to come home and become part of the village again.\nVoice 2  \nPareyio explains to The Huffington Post how important it is for entire communities to be involved in these reconciliation ceremonies:\nVoice 3  \n“The ceremonies are a public promise by the girls and their families to keep them away from FGM, early marriage and other dangers that they could face when they are young women, when they are extra vulnerable.”\nVoice 1  \nSix years after they ran away from home, Mercy and Agnes returned to their village through one of these reconciliation ceremonies. They saw their family again and were accepted back into their community. They are no longer afraid of FGM.\nImage by Alex Strachan from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nChanging a culture is a long and difficult process. It involves patience, understanding, and working with many different people. But Pareyio continues to work to end FGM in the Maasai culture, one girl at a time.\nVoice 1  \nWhat about you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nTen men are on the court – five on each team. They are playing a game with an orange ball. They pass it back and forth. They bounce it on the hard gym floor. They are trying to get the ball through a hoop. The hoop is small and round, and high in the air. So the men must throw the ball with speed and accuracy. The teams try to block each other’s attempts to throw the ball. This is the world’s second most popular team sport – basketball.\nVoice 2  \nMany famous basketball players are from the United States. But not all! Manute Bol played for almost 10 years in the NBA – the National Basketball Association in the United States. He was not from the US, but from Sudan. For many years, he was the tallest player in the NBA. Many people remember him for playing basketball. Others remember him for how much he loved his home country of Sudan. Today’s Spotlight is about the life of Manute Bol.\nVoice 1  \nManute Bol was born in Sudan in a village of the Dinka people. His name means “special blessing.” Before Bol was born, his mother had two babies die. So his parents believed Bol was a special blessing. They hoped he would grow to take care of the family’s cows. But Bol always wanted to do more. He wanted to explore different places.\nVoice 2  \nThe Dinka are some of the tallest people in Africa. But Bol was tall even for the Dinkas! He was about 2.3 meters tall. When he was young, many people would watch him and laugh at him. Bol’s cousin remembered how difficult it was for Bol to be so tall. He told The Washington Post:\nVoice 3  \n“Manute did not like people to look at him. When he went to the market, traffic stopped. Many people stopped their cars and got out to laugh at him.”\nVoice 1  \nBol’s cousin thought Bol could be a very good basketball player. Another cousin told Bol that he could be rich and famous if he played in the United States. So Bol decided to try playing basketball.\nManute Bol at a Save Darfur event in 2006 “DSC_0119” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by United to End Genocide\nVoice 2  \nBol started playing for a small team in Khartoum. But he did not know how to play! But he worked hard and learned quickly. Tony Amin, the coach who guided and led the team, remembers teaching Bol how to play. He described one of the things Bol learned how to do:\nVoice 4  \n“Manute was very, very happy when someone shot the basketball and he blocked it. You do not find tall players like Manute on other teams. We were expecting a player like this would one day achieve something.”\nVoice 1  \nIn 1982, a coach from the United States saw Bol playing. He immediately brought Bol to the US to play basketball. Bol was tall, but he was not very strong. People made fun of him because of his height and body. One coach even said that Bol was so thin that he would break like an insect. Many people wondered why Bol was in the NBA. They thought he was a joke.\nVoice 2  \nBut those people were wrong. Bol started playing in the NBA in 1985. In his first year, he blocked 397 shots. This was an average of five shots each game. It was also a new record for a player in his first NBA season! He did not score many points. But Bol became famous for blocking shots. Some people even called him a “shot-blocking” machine! Bol played in the NBA for a long time. This is unusual. Many people get injured and leave basketball early. The average player only plays for five years. Yet Bol played in the NBA for almost 10 years! He played for four different teams.\nVoice 1  \nBol lived and worked in the United States. But he loved Sudan. And he never forgot his home country or the people who lived there. Around that time, Sudan was in the middle of war. Bol often travelled back to Sudan to help others. He supported family members who were living in Sudan during the war. Bol explained to Sports Illustrated:\nVoice 5  \n“God guided me to America and gave me a good job. But he also gave me a heart so I would look back.”\nVoice 2  \nBol worked for peace in Sudan. He encouraged the opposing sides to come together. He even took part in government peace talks. He spent much of his money helping Sudan.\nVoice 1  \nBut he also believed that education was very important. He believed that the way to achieve peace in Sudan would come through education. So he helped build a school in his home village of Turalei – the Manute Bol School. Then he had a bigger dream. Bol told The Telegraph:\nVoice 5  \n“My dream is to build schools across Sudan, because with education, you can have a good life, find a job, and improve… The children are the future of Sudan, no matter where they come from.”\n“R Manute Bol” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by United to End Genocide\nVoice 2  \nChildren continue to learn at the Manute Bol School that he helped build. Today, it has two buildings and six classrooms. And in February 2017, the students placed first in their county for their annual exams!\nVoice 1  \nBol’s plan was to build 41 schools throughout Sudan. But he was never able to build those schools. He died in 2010 from kidney failure and a rare skin condition. He was only 47 years old. When Bol died, one of his teams released a statement that described how Bol had influenced the world around him. It said:\nVoice 6  \n“He was a great basketball player. But people will remember him for how hard he worked. They will remember him working in his native Sudan and the cities in which he played.”\nVoice 2\n What about you?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Robin Basselin. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIt is an autumn day in Iowa, in the United States. A small crowd of people gather together. They are standing in a huge, flat field. All around, there is green grass and farm land. In the far distance, there is a round target. On the target, there are brightly colored rings or circles.\nVoice 2 \nOne man stands in front of the crowd. He holds a bow – a weapon that shoots arrows. He gently places an arrow on the bow. He pulls the arrow back toward his ear. He carefully aims at the target. He releases the bow. The arrow flies through the air. After 210 meters, the arrow hits the target. The crowd cheers. The archer has set a new world record. He has completed the world’s longest archery shot to hit a target.\nVoice 1 \nThis is an amazing event. But it is even more amazing than you might think. The archer that broke the record is Matt Stutzman. And he has no arms! Today’s Spotlight is on Matt Stutzman, the armless archer.\n\n\nVoice 2 \nMatt Stutzman was born in 1982. When he was born, he did not have arms. He was disabled, but he was healthy in every other way. When Stutzman was 4 months old, his parents decided that they could not care for him.  They wanted someone to adopt him. So, they surrendered their parental rights. They hoped that other parents would care for their son – and make him a part of their family.\nVoice 1 \nWhen Stutzman was 10 months old, Leon and Jean Stutzman did just that. They adopted him. The Stutzmans raised Matt on their family farm. They loved and cared for him. They taught him to work hard. And even though he had a disability, they encouraged him to try and do anything he wanted to do. Jean Stutzman wrote about Matt’s story on the website mattstutzman.com. She explained,\nVoice 3 \n“Our family plan was to give Matt the freedom to try almost anything – if he could complete it on his own. The natural reaction would have been to quickly enter each situation and help him.”\nVoice 2 \nHowever, the Stutzmans chose not to help Matt right away. They chose to let him try, fail and try again. If Matt could not find a way to do something, they would help him. But they always let him try alone first.\nVoice 1 \nThis may seem like an unusual way to raise a child with a disability. But Matt Stutzman is thankful for his parents’ teaching. They taught him that if you think something is not possible, then it will not be possible. But if you work hard and believe it is possible, you can achieve great things. Stutzman believes this has helped him succeed at many things in life – including archery. Today, Stutzman lives a completely un-adapted life. He has not changed anything in his home or car to make it easier for him to live without arms. He also does not use prosthetic arms – arms created by doctors and scientists. The way the Stutzmans raised Matt has strongly influenced him. On his website, he explains,\nVoice 4\n“I was born without arms. But I was blessed to have two amazing and patient parents that raised me. They taught me a long time ago, that impossible is a way of thinking. And they taught me not to think that way. This has served me well.”\nVoice 2 \nStutzman was blessed with good parents. But he was also born with very good physical skill. Stutzman quickly learned to do many things with his feet. In fact, he could do many things with his feet better than most people could do these same things with their hands. It was clear at an early age that he had good skill and aim.\nVoice 1 \nStutzman told the Telegraph news organization a funny story about this. When he was young, he used to pull fruit off the trees on his family farm. Often, he would use his feet to kick the fruit at his brother. For most people, kicking a small piece of fruit and aiming it well would be difficult. But Stutzman said he could hit his brother in the head every time! Stutzman recognized at this young age that he had great physical ability. And he learned to use his physical ability to do many things. This helped him as he grew up.\nVoice 2 \nWhen Stutzman was 16 years old, he bought his first bow and arrow. He wanted to hunt animals with it. After buying the bow, Stutzman needed to learn how to shoot it without arms. But there was no one to teach him how to do this. Stutzman joked about this with the NPR news organization. He said,\nVoice 4 \n“If you search the internet using Google and write – ‘how to teach a guy without arms to shoot’ – you will not find that. Usually, you can find anything on Google. But you just cannot find that.”\nVoice 1 \nSo Stutzman had to teach himself. He learned to hold the bow with his feet. He also learned to use the side of his mouth to guide the release of the arrow from the bow. It is an unusual method for shooting a bow and arrow. But Stutzman believes that his lack of arms is helpful in archery. He told the MSNBC news organization,\nVoice 4 \n“I believe how I shoot is an advantage. I use my leg and my leg is the strongest part of my body.”\nVoice 2 \nStutzman’s skill, method and desire to compete have made him very successful. On October 30, 2011, Stutzman set the World Record for the longest archery shot to hit a target. And in September of 2012, he won a silver medal award at the London Paralympic Games. Stutzman hopes this is just the beginning of his success. He told the KCCI news organization,\nVoice 4 \n“I want to be the best in world. Not just the best archer with no arms or with a disability. This is what encourages me to keep training and working.”\nVoice 1 \nHowever, winning is not Stutzman’s only reason for competing. He also wants to encourage people. Stutzman told Telegraph news,\nVoice 4 \n“I hope that I can affect even one person in a positive way. If I can show one person that life is not so bad and that they can achieve anything – that is very important for me.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Robin Basselin.

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Adam Navis.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nDo you have anything about your body that you want to change? Maybe you wish you had stronger arms or legs? Do you want to look more like an athlete? Charles Atlas wanted to change his body. He was small and weak. And he did not like it. He worked hard to become a strong man. He then used his success to create a very large exercise company. Today’s Spotlight is on Charles Atlas.\nVoice 2  \nIn 1903, an 11-year-old boy moved to the United States – to Brooklyn in New York. He was from Italy. His name was Angelo Siciliano. His family did not have a lot of money. Angelo was small, and often sick. The other boys often beat him up.\nVoice 1  \nThere is a famous story about Angelo. In the story, he was a young man visiting a nearby beach. He was trying to get a girl to like him. A much bigger man kicked sand in his face. Angelo felt shame. He was so small that he could not fight back. He knew he could not win the fight. So he decided to change his body. He decided to get stronger.\nVoice 2  \nThere were not many exercise programs or classes for him to join. And he did not have enough money to pay for training. So Angelo started exercising by himself, in his own home. He started by lifting things that were heavy and making his own equipment. But this method was not very successful. And he did not have money to buy more equipment.\nPhoto by jean wimmerlin\nVoice 1  \nThen one day he visited the zoo. He watched the lion’s strong muscles as it moved. He understood that the lion was getting stronger as it stretched its body. This gave Angelo the idea to change how he was exercising. He would add stretching and call his program Dynamic Tension.\nVoice 2  \nDynamic means movement. And tension happens when two things oppose, or are against, each other. Angelo’s system combined moving and stretching, tightening muscles for tension, and breathing. It did not require any equipment or weights. It used the weight of a person’s body to create strength. Today, this method is commonly called isometrics.\nVoice 1  \nAngelo practiced Dynamic Tension for a few months. As a result he was no longer small and weak. He was big and strong. His friends noticed his new body. They told him that he looked like a statue that was on the top of a local hotel. It was a statue of Atlas. Atlas is a god from old Greek stories. The story says that Atlas was so strong that could hold up the whole earth on his shoulders. Angelo liked this name. So he changed his name to Charles Atlas!\nVoice 2  \nWith his new body, Charles Atlas began posing as a model for many artists making statues. Around this time, he also took part in competitions to find the “World’s Most Beautiful Man” and the “World’s Most Perfectly Developed Man”. He won both titles. Soon after this, he decided to make his success into a business. He found a business partner and started to sell his exercise plan. Now other people could become strong and well-developed just like him.\nVoice 1  \nCharles Atlas wanted to show people that his method really worked. He often demonstrated his strength. He worked in travelling shows. He lifted heavy weights. He balanced on his hands. The writer Jerry Cowle described meeting Charles Atlas at a summer camp.\nVoice 3  \n“First he tore a thick paper phone book in half. Next he bent an iron bar into a horseshoe shape with just his hands. Then he put a long iron bar in his teeth and had two men hang from it, one from each end. Finally he lay on a bed of sharp nails while the same two men stood on a piece of wood across his chest. We all cheered. Atlas deserved the title ‘World’s Most Perfectly Developed Man’.”\nVoice 2  \nAtlas made his Dynamic Tension exercises into a 12-week program. He used his own story to sell the program. Young boys read about the program in the back of comic magazines like Superman, Batman, or Spiderman. The comic story advertisement showed a small boy getting sand kicked in his face. Then the boy did Dynamic Tension. He was then able to defend himself.\nVoice 1  \nCharles Atlas never stopped building his business. He performed acts of strength often. He also cared about the people who bought his program. Many people liked that Atlas himself would write to people who bought the program. And he never stopped working to improve the program. He continued to make new and better exercises.\nVoice 2  \nBy the 1950s, Atlas had sold over a million copies of his exercise program. People from all over the world bought it. They wrote to thank him for changing their lives. The program was translated into seven different languages. For the next 20 years it was the most popular exercise program in the world. In fact, people can still buy it today!\nVoice 1  \nAtlas also believed his success came because of how he lived his life. He did not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. He encouraged people to go to church. He told people to get up early in the morning. He thought it was important for boys and girls to keep their rooms clean and organized. And even though he was a wealthy man, he lived in a simple home with his family.\nVoice 2  \nPeople still use exercise programs. There are many new kinds to choose from. People still want to change their bodies. Atlas’ Dynamic Tension program is just one of many exercise programs. But Charles Atlas showed the world that you do not need complex equipment to become strong. You do not need to pay someone lots of money to teach you to be healthy. All you need is your own body, hard work, and clean living.\nVoice 1  \nWhat do you think? Is it really that simple to get strong and stay healthy? Do you use an exercise program?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nIn 1756 a baby was born in the city of Salzburg. His family was very musical. The father played the violin for the ruler of the city. The mother loved to sing. The older daughter played the instrument called the clavier, which came before modern pianos. But this baby was different. This baby would become very, very good at playing music. When we say his family name today, people only think of him. Today’s Spotlight is on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his music.\nVoice 2  \nMozart was only three years old when he discovered music. He climbed on the seat of the clavier and began to press the keys. He liked how the different keys made different sounds. Soon his father began to teach him music. His father was very serious about music. But Mozart loved music so it never felt like work. When Mozart was only five years old he wrote, or composed, music that people still play today. This music is the Minuet in G.\nPhoto by Tadas Mikuckis \nVoice 1  \nWhen people came to visit the family, Mozart’s father made his children play music. People were amazed. But Mozart’s father wanted his children to play music for important people. He wanted them to perform for kings and princes in Europe. He decided to bring the children to the city of Vienna in Austria. There, they would play for the Empress Maria Teresa.\nVoice 2  \nThey took many days to travel to Vienna. But Mozart had the chance to play before the empress. He was only six years old. His hands were small. His feet did not touch the floor. But he played like a skilled adult.\nVoice 1  \nEveryone was amazed. The empress gave the children gifts. She paid Mozart’s father to teach her own children music. She asked Mozart to come back and play again and again.\nVoice 2  \nBut Mozart’s father wanted his family to be more famous. He wanted to travel all over Europe. At that time, there were no ways to record music. A musician could only make money performing in front of people. The best situation was to play for kings and queens. So Mozart’s father made his son travel and play music. Mozart played for the kings and queens of France and England.\nVoice 1  \nThis was not an easy life. Clair Huchet Bishop wrote a book about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s childhood. It is called Mozart: Music Magician. In her book she writes,\nVoice 3  \n“Wolfgang and his sister were tired. They had been gone from home for nearly three years. Travelling was not easy. The places they stayed were not always comfortable. It was difficult to meet new people and to entertain them hour after hour. The children also had to practice every day. And Mozart composed new music as well.”\nVoice 2  \nMozart composed his first symphony at age eight. This is the first opera Mozart wrote. It is called Apollo et Hyacinthus. Operas are complex pieces of music. They tell a story through instrumental music and singing. Mozart wrote this opera at the age of 11. The opera tells an old Greek myth.\nVoice 1  \nAs he grew, Mozart played less and less for kings and queens. He got a job playing music for the ruler of Saltzburg, like his father. But it did not earn a lot of money. But Mozart wanted more. At age 22, he decided to leave his job and move to Vienna like he did when he was a child.\nPhoto by Zach Doty\nVoice 2  \nIn Vienna, Mozart married and started a family. He continued making beautiful, complex music. He was able to live in a nice home. Mozart had many wonderful times in the years that followed. He wrote over 600 musical works. These included operas, symphonies, and all kinds of other music. He met more kings and queens. His music helped make the piano a popular instrument. However, there were also many times when Mozart did not have enough money. He did not want to compose music for rich people. He wanted to compose new, creative kinds of music.\nVoice 1  \nMozart died in 1791. He was only 35 years old. There was a false rumor about his death. It said that someone poisoned Mozart. But today, experts believe he probably died of a common infection or sickness. He was buried in a place for people who do not have much money. Since it was a common grave, it was not marked with a stone just for Mozart. So, even today, no one knows where Mozart is buried.\nPhoto by Marius Masalar\nVoice 2  \nToday, many people consider Mozart to be one of the greatest writers of classical music. But most people do not listen to Mozart’s music, unless it is in films or television. Richard Taruskin is a music teacher and writer. He wrote about Mozart for the New York Times. He argued that for many people, listening to Mozart’s music became a sign of being wealthy, educated, and high-class. But he does not think this should be. He believes that everyone should listen to Mozart. In his article, Taruskin shares a quote from another famous music composer. It is the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\nVoice 4  \n“Mozart was as pure as an angel and his music is full of God’s beauty. It contains all the points of all beauty in the world of music.”\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever listened to the music of Mozart? Do you think Mozart’s music matters? Do you have a favorite music composer?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nThe children laugh and shout loudly. They are playing games in the playground. One child is “it”. He runs after a group of other children. He catches one of them. That second child becomes ‘it’. She now chases the other children and tries to catch one. They are all playing a game of chase or tag.\nVoice 2 \nIn another area of the playground, two children each hold opposite ends of a long rope. They turn it round and round and up and down. Other children take turns to jump over the rope as it is being turned. They are skipping. And all the children who are skipping are also singing special skipping songs.\nVoice 1 \nChildren in all parts of the world play similar games. Many generations of children have enjoyed playing these traditional games. But could these games have a more important purpose? Today’s Spotlight is on traditional children’s playground games.\nVoice 2  \nExperts everywhere agree that play is good for children. They say it is important for a child’s mental and physical development. Nicola Butler from the organisation Play England told the Huffington Post,\nVoice 3 \n‘Traditional playground games are necessary for children’s health, wellbeing and development. Playing these games lets children learn about friendships. They learn about arguing, making up, negotiating and resolving disputes, and making the game fun and fair. But most importantly being involved in these games make children happy.’\nVoice 1 \nDid you know that children from many countries play the same or similar traditional games? Though, these games often have different names in different countries. The game of leapfrog has been played in the United Kingdom since the 16th century. In this game, one child bends down and holds his knees or ankles. Another child runs up to the first child, places her hands on the back of the first child, and leaps or jumps over the first child. Any number of children can play the game. They all take turns to leap, or jump, like a frog. In other countries children jump like a different animal. In France children call this same game ‘sauté-mouton’ which means ‘leap sheep’. In India they call it ‘Aar Ghodi Ki Par Ghodi’ which means ‘leap horse’.\nVoice 2 \nAnother game children play all over the world is hopscotch. In Albania they call the game varra. In Germany it is hinkspiel. Yohanes Lie told TOPICS Online magazine what the game is called in his country,\nVoice 4 \n‘When I was a child, my friends and I used to play many traditional games from my country, Indonesia. A game I played a lot was called One Leg Jump.’\nVoice 1 \n‘One leg jump’ is a good name for the game of hopscotch. That is because the name ‘one leg jump’ helps you understand how to play the game! The players mark squares on the ground using a stone or piece of chalk. Children in different parts of the world make different shapes or grids with the squares. But some things are always the same. The children all hop or jump on one leg from square to square. And they must not put a foot on any line.\nVoice 2 \nVery often, children play the game using a stone. They throw the stone onto square one and take their turn hopping on the whole grid. They hop to the last square. Then they turn round and hop back. On their next turn they will throw their stone onto square two. And on their next turn they throw on to square three and so on. If the stone does not land in the correct square, the child must lose a turn. Maria Lopez from Columbia told TOPICS how she enjoyed playing hopscotch when she was a child,\nVoice 5 \n‘When I was a little girl, most afternoons I used to play games with my friends in our street. Rayuela, as hopscotch is called in Spanish, was my favourite game. It is nice to remember playing games like Rayuela because it shows me that I had a happy time as a child surrounded by special people who always loved me.’\nVoice 1 \nIt may surprise you to learn that hopscotch is a very old game. Experts say that nearly 2000 years ago, Roman soldiers used something similar as an exercise. They had to hop up and down a 100 foot series of squares. They did this to make them stronger and quicker on their feet.\nVoice 2 \nMarbles is another ancient game that is played around the world. No one knows exactly how old it is. But we know the Romans played this game too. You can see children playing marbles on ancient Roman wall paintings.\nVoice 1 \nBut what are marbles? And how do you play the game of marbles? Marbles are very small hard balls. You can find marbles made from different sorts of stone, including the stone called ‘marble’. But most marbles are made from brightly coloured glass. People play many different sorts of games with their marbles. But all of these games are called simply ‘marbles’.\nVoice 2 \n‘The Ring Game’ is one popular game of marbles. A child uses a stone or chalk to make a circle or ring on the ground. Those playing the game put a few of their marbles into the ring. Each child rolls or shoots another marble to try to push one of the marbles out of the ring. If a player manages to do this he keeps that marble. Hakan Tuncer, from Turkey, played marbles as child. But he used a triangle shape – not a circle. He told TOPICS how he and his friends would compete for marbles,\nVoice 6 \n‘I think the most important thing was to have as many marbles as we could. We competed to win the most marbles. The person who won the most marbles was the leader of the group. And everyone tried to be the leader. Now I understand that this small competition was our first experience with power and leadership.’\nVoice 1 \nTraditional playground games are about more than just fun. Hopefully children continue to learn these games and their valuable lessons for hundreds more years.\nVoice 2 \nDo you remember playing traditional playground games when you were a child?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nThree men climb near the top of Mount Everest. It is very, very cold. And the wind is blowing. The climbers decide to return to camp for the night. As they move back down the mountain, they meet a group of angry Sherpa men. These local guides help climbers on the mountain. But today, they are angry with the three climbers. The guides believe the climbers were unsafe.  And they think the climbers caused an accident that hurt their friend.\nVoice 2\nSoon, almost 100 angry guides surround the three climbers! The climbers are scared. The fight has become violent. Just then, a woman walks into the angry crowd. She stands between the three climbers and the angry guides. She takes the hand of one of the guides. The woman calms the situation and encourages the men to talk. After 45 minutes, they all sign a paper. It says they agree to stop fighting.\nVoice 1 \nThe woman who stopped the fight is Melissa Arnot. She is a famous female mountain climber. And her desire to help other people has earned her the respect of climbers all over the world. Today’s Spotlight is on Melissa Arnot.\nVoice 2 \nMelissa Arnot is from the western United States. As a child, she enjoyed nature and being active. But, she did not start climbing mountains until after university. In 2001, Arnot climbed her first mountain. It was Mount Rainer in the state of Washington. This climb changed her life. After, she decided to devote her life to climbing. She trained to become a wilderness emergency medical expert. And later, she became a mountain climbing guide.\nVoice 1 \nOver the last 10 years, Arnot has climbed many of the world’s tallest and most difficult mountains. She has climbed Mounts McKinley, Kilimanjaro, and Cayambe. She has also climbed Cotopaxi and Aconcagua four times each.  But the mountain she has climbed the most is Mount Rainier. She has reached the top over 100 times!\nVoice 2 \nOne of the most difficult mountains Arnot has climbed is Mount Everest. Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world. And it is located in the country of Nepal. On May 21st, 2013, Arnot climbed Everest for the 5th time. This was a great achievement. After, Eddie Bauer asked Arnot if she felt a responsibility to encourage female climbers. She said:\nVoice 3 \n“I am proud to be a part of the continually changing sport of mountain climbing. I would be proud to encourage any climber, man or woman, to push their own limits in the mountains. The mountain does not know if you are a man or a woman.”\nVoice 1 \nArnot loves climbing. But she does not do it just to set records. She told ESPN W news,\nVoice 3 \n“The honest truth is that very few people care what I am doing. I am not curing cancer or feeding hungry children.  I am continually working toward these goals. I am pushing myself into territory that is always changing…All I am really doing is trying to teach myself how to live.”\nVoice 2 \nArnot loves to help other people live, learn and push their own limits too. She has worked as a mountain climbing guide since 2004. She loves her work. But being a female guide can be difficult. Not all people are willing to work with Arnot. Some climbers have refused to let her guide them. And some guides treat her differently. She told ESPN W news,\nVoice 3 \n“The other guides that I work with sometimes treat me like I am less able than them. I do not think they mean to do it. I just think their natural reaction to a small, young woman is that I can not be their equal.”\nVoice 1 \nBut Arnot has earned the respect of many people in the mountain climbing community. She works hard and always helps other people. These qualities have made her many friends. One particular friend was Chhewang Nima. Nima was a well-known Nepali guide. He had climbed Everest 19 times!  In 2010, Arnot was climbing with Nima. They had climbed together many times before. But on this climb, the ice broke. And Nima died.\nVoice 2 \nArnot could not stop thinking about Nima’s wife and two sons. They were left alone. Arnot told Outside magazine,\nVoice 3 \n“For a few years, his wife refused to see me. She was not ready. Last year, she was finally ready to see me. We sat in her house, but she could not talk. She was just crying. It was a pain I cannot describe.”\nVoice 1 \nArnot recognized that the family was suffering both emotionally and financially. The local Sherpa guides do very dangerous work. But there is little support for their families if they die. Arnot told Outside magazine:\nVoice 3 \n“The Sherpa will continue to take this dangerous work. They love Everest, and it is how they earn money to support themselves. So, I want to teach climbers to respect their support team. And I want to help Sherpa get what they need.”\nVoice 2 \nSo Arnot and climber David Morton formed the organization Juniper Fund. The goal of this organization is to support local mountain guides, like the Sherpa. The organization provides rescue resources for local guides. And if a guide dies, they provide money and other resources for the families. For Arnot, this work is a way to give back to the climbing community. And it is a way to respect the important work of the Sherpa guides.\nVoice 1 \nArnot works in a field full of risk and challenge. Climbing is both exciting and dangerous.  And it has taught her a lot. She has learned to develop her own abilities, and she has learned to care for other people. But Arnot told womensmovement.com.\nVoice 3 \n“The most important thing I have learned is that mountains do not care who you are. They do not care where you came from. And they do not care how many times you have been there before…You have to show up with a desire to work with the uncontrollable and the unknown. This is something that continually translates back into my day-to-day life.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Lauren Visser. The producer was Mark Drenth.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nJaap Stam was living the dream of many young people. He was an athlete. Playing football was his job. As a sports player, Stam was healthy and successful. He had played for the famous football team Manchester United. He had a new job on another good football team – Lazio. But, in 2001 he took a test. The test found that he had used the drug steroids.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nStam spent four months banned from football. He said that he had not used steroids on purpose. Stam returned to play football for many years. But he is only one of many athletes who have taken steroids. Why do some athletes use these drugs? What effect do steroids have on the body and on sports? Today’s Spotlight is on sports and steroids.\nVoice 1 \nSteroids are a strong version of testosterone. Human bodies create testosterone naturally. Women have low levels of testosterone. Men usually have higher levels of testosterone. This is why men usually have more muscle – the hard tissue on the body that gives people strength.\nPills; Image by Charles Thompson from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSteroids give a person a very high level of testosterone. This makes the muscles in a person’s body grow faster and larger. Steroids were first invented as a medicine. They can be taken in by mouth, rubbed on the skin or injected. They have been used to treat people with cancer, HIV and AIDS and other diseases. But people who are not sick also use steroids.\nVoice 1 \nAthletes began using steroids in the 1950s. Steroids gave athletes an advantage. They could be stronger and faster than their competitors. By the 1960s many major sports organizations had passed laws against using steroids. The organizations began to test athletes to make sure that they were not using steroids.\nVoice 2 \nBut if taking steroids was against the rules, why would athletes take them? Some people say that athletes feel a large amount of pressure to win. They think that athletes use steroids because other people expect so much of them. Athletes must always run faster, jump higher and be stronger! Jose Conseco is a famous baseball player in the United States. He admitted to using steroids. He told the U.S. House of Representatives:\nVoice 3 \n“There was so much pressure to win games, please my supporters, and get the big contract, for more money. It led me, and others, to behaviour that would produce immediate results. This is the same pressure that leads young people today to that same behaviour.”\nVoice 1 \nFor these reasons, some athletes choose to take steroids. But when they do, they are also facing many risks. There are professional risks and also social and physical risks. Omar Ortiz is a football player from Mexico. In 2010 he took a test that said he had taken steroids. He was banned from playing football for two years.\nVoice 2 \nAn athlete may also lose her awards. Marion Jones is a runner. In the year 2000 she won five medals at the Olympic games. But Jones had to return her awards because she had used steroids. Jones understood that her use of drugs affected her body. She also saw that it affected many other people. The Washington Post reports that Jones said:\nVoice 4  \n“I want to apologize to you all for all of this. I am sorry for making you all sad in so many ways.”\nMarion Jones in 2006; https://www.flickr.com/photos/tfa/ Thomas Faivre-Duboz, CC BY-SA 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nThere are also problems for the sport when people are found to be using steroids.  Sports are based on being healthy and playing fairly – by the rules. People may lose interest in a sport if they know that some athletes have an unfair advantage.\nVoice 2 \nSteroids can also have many negative effects on physical health. These are problems with growing well and skin and hair problems. Steroids can also cause problems with the heart and the liver. They increase the chance of stroke and cancer. There are also side effects of steroids that affect behavior. People who use steroids can become very angry without reason. The steroids may make them feel sad and worried. But many people use steroids even when they know the risks of physical problems.\nVoice 1 \nAnd many of the people who use steroids are quite young.  Dr. Linn Goldberg works for the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. She tells the news organization MSNBC:\nVoice 5 \n“Sports role models are very powerful in a young child’s life. They think that if a professional athlete had to use that, then maybe I should use that.”\nVoice 2 \nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse looked at young people in the United States. They found that over half of a million young people are using steroids. These 13 to 15 year olds care very much about doing well in sports. They are also very concerned about having a strong body. They are even willing to take risks with their health. Studies show that using steroids is even more dangerous for very young people.\nA man poses at a bodybuilding competition; Image by fvasallo from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nYet there are also people with different ideas about steroids and sports. Some people argue that steroids should be made legal. Some people say that steroids are not very different than what athletes have been doing for many years. Kenan Malik of the BBC says:\nVoice 6 \n“But scientists already help athletes win. Cyclist Chris Boardman won his Olympic Gold in 1992. He was sitting on a specially created machine – his two wheeled bicycle. In the Rugby World Cup, England players wore special shirts. These shirts were very close to their bodies. They were designed so the other team could not hold on to them. In these two cases the scientific work did not reduce the sporting victory. Why should we see drug use differently?”\nVoice 2 \nOther people say that if steroids were legal, they would cause less damage. Adrianne Blue writes in The New Statesman:\nVoice 7 \n“Steroids may not be desirable, but they are here to stay. We should make steroids legal. Then they can be controlled. And athletes will not take too much and do themselves damage.”\nVoice 1 \nDo you think that making steroids legal would be a good solution? What is the effect of steroid use on your favorite sport?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nImagine a world where monsters are real. But these are not the frightening creatures that you see in films. And they are also different from the monsters in traditional stories. Some of these monsters live with humans. Some live in the wild, like animals. These creatures are more intelligent than animals. They even have amazing special powers. Some can fly and breathe fire. One looks like a big black snake, with steel skin. But not all the monsters look so frightening. Some are very cute. Some are even beautiful. One very famous one looks like a yellow mouse with a big round face.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2  \nThis imagined world of strange creatures is the world of Pokémon. And this world exists inside a video game! Today, this video game has grown to include television programs, books, trading cards, toys, and many other things. It is famous around the world. Today’s Spotlight is on the amazing world of Pokémon.\nVoice 1  \nSatoshi Tajiri created Pokémon. He was born in Japan in 1968. As a child, Tajiri loved collecting insects. He spent many hours by lakes. There, he observed different animals and insects. Tajiri told Time Magazine Asia:\nVoice 3  \n“Every time I found a new insect, it was a mystery to me. The more I searched for insects, the more I found. If I put my hand in the river, I would find water insects there. If there was a stick over a hole, I would find insects underneath it. As I gathered more, I learned more about them. I saw how some even eat each other.”\nVoice 2  \nBut Tajiri was also very interested in video games. As a young man, he played them all of the time. Tajiri knew he wanted to make video games as an adult. As young adults, he and a friend began their own video game company. One of their video games was an early version of Pokémon.\nVoice 1  \nTo make Pokémon, Tajiri combined the two things he loved most: insects and video games. As an adult, he remembered his experiences as a child. He remembered how he liked finding insects in the grass. He thought this could make a good game. People could collect Pokémon creatures like he collected insects. For him, collecting insects had been like exploring a new world. Could he give that experience to other people in a game?\nVoice 2  \nIn the game of Pokémon, the player plays the part of the trainer. A trainer is a person who works with Pokémon. Trainers travel around the game world. They collect as many different kinds of Pokémon as they can. Together, the trainer and Pokémon also enter competitions. They battle against other Pokémon and trainers.\nVoice 1  \nThe video game company Nintendo agreed to make Tajiri’s game. Tajiri wanted to make two games, called Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green. People would play them on Nintendo’s Game Boy. Game Boy was a very small video game system. A person could carry it with them. It was very popular with young children.\nVoice 2  \nBut the Game Boy had another important element that made it very important for the Pokémon game: the link cable. The link cable was a short black wire. It connected one Game Boy to another. Tajiri wanted people playing the game to collect Pokémon. But he also wanted them to trade Pokémon. They could do this through the link cable. Their Pokémon could even battle. This would give people another reason to play the game. Many video games involve only one person. But in Pokémon, many people could play at once. They could share in their experiences together. Tom Battey of Gamasutra.com shared his experience as a child. He says,\nVoice 4  \n“It was a process that brought us together. Some children get each other friendship bracelets. Or some come closer by sharing illegal experiences. We traded Pokémon.”\nColorful Pokemon X And Y Map clipart\nVoice 1  \nIt took six years to create the first Pokemon games. And Nintendo released the games on February 27, 1996. Satoshi Tajiri did not make money on Pokémon in the beginning. It was not an immediate success, even in Japan. People needed time to explore the world of Pokémon. But soon, they told their friends about it. And these friends told other friends. The game had many different levels and layers. Players could explore all parts of it.\nVoice 2  \nNintendo sold more and more Pokémon games. And Pokémon began to spread to other kinds of entertainment. A Pokémon television program began in Japan in 1997. One year later, the television program began in North America. Over one and a half million people watched it.\nVoice 1  \nAnother famous part of the Pokémon world is the trading card game.  These cards are thick pieces of paper. Each one has a different Pokémon on the front. Some are more difficult to find than others, just like in the video game. People can use the cards to play Pokémon, just like in the video game. They can trade their Pokémon and battle.\nVoice 2  \nToday, Pokémon is over 20 years old. Nintendo has released over 50 different Pokémon video games. The children who first played the game are adults. Some of them have children of their own. Now, these children can also explore the world of Pokémon. The idea of Pokémon has expanded to include books, television programs, toys and many other things.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n“Four people are dead as competing fans riot at Honduras soccer game”\n“It is a dark day in tennis as Monica Seles is stabbed on court”\n“Fans Attack Baseball Coach On Field”\n“Hundreds of soccer fans riot violently at game in South Africa”\nClick here to follow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nThese are real news headlines. They come from the past few years and around the world. They are all about violent sports fans. Fans are loyal to a team or sport. Of course, not all sports fans are violent or bad. But fans do many extreme things because of sports games. Millions of people say that being a sports fan is one of the most important things in their lives. Why do people love sports so much? And why do fans support their teams so strongly? Today’s Spotlight is on the reasons people become sports fans and why they act in particular ways.\nVoice 2 \nLoyalty to sports teams crosses every border. People of every nationality, culture, income level, gender and age love to watch sports. Sports are entertaining. They are easy for anyone to access, and do not cost much. And people like to watch athletes perform! Athletes inspire us with their strength, skill and hard work. Many people follow one sport, and one team in particular.\nVoice 1 \nBut being a loyal sports fan can have negative results. At the beginning of this program we heard examples of sports fan violence. People can also feel depressed when their team loses. However, being a sports fan has many positive results too. Fans feel great when their team wins! Studies show that sports fans think better thoughts about themselves. They are less depressed and less lonely. Dr. Daniel Wann is a leading expert on fan behavior. He made a list of 24 examples of social well-being that come with being a fan of a sports team. He tells the Seattle Times:\nVoice 3 \n“There has been a lot of research in my lab and by others in multiple cultures. It shows that when an individual becomes attached to a sports team, there are pretty clear mental benefits of that.”\nVoice 2 \nBeing a fan also produces complex biological reactions and social behavior. Imagine you are watching your favorite team or athlete play a game. Your heart starts to beat faster. You become very excited. You are not moving much but you begin to sweat. Studies show this happens to many sports fans. They react physically to the game even though they are not playing.\nBy Magharebia – Football match violence worries Moroccans | العنف في ملاعب كرة القدم يقلق المغاربة | La violence dans les stades inquiète les Marocains, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24202432\nVoice 1 \nChemicals in the fans’ bodies also change in the same way that the athletes’ bodies do. Experts call these “mirror neurons.” So sports fans experience a kind of mirror reflection of what they are watching. They feel tension. But they also experience the release of chemical substances in their body. These make the fans feel happy. Shankar Vedantam is a social science reporter for the news organization NPR. He says:\nVoice 4 \n“Sports allow us to feel intensely about something that really is not very important. The truth is, tomorrow, if your team wins or loses, you are still going to be OK. So in some ways watching sports is like watching a horror movie. You feel intensely but the risks are not that high.”\nVoice 2 \nOur minds, emotions and bodies respond strongly to sports. And we respond even more if we care more. The other main reason people care so much about sports is social. Many people like to watch sports events with their friends and family. But the social element of being a sports fan is much more than that.\nVoice 1 \nPeople like belonging to a group. Being part of a team makes us feel we have things in common with the people around us. We form groups naturally. People are also naturally very loyal to their “in-group.” They feel they belong and connect emotionally to the other members of the group. They also often share a dislike for people in an “out-group” – like an opposing sports team. Christine Emba reports for the Washington Post:\nVoice 5 \n“Studies have shown that for fans, being identified with a favorite team is more important than being identified with their work and social groups. And it is sometimes more important to them than being identified with their religion.”\nBy Liondartois – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17058217\nVoice 2 \nOur attachment to sports teams comes from a deeper desire for connection. People want to feel valuable and important in the world. Some experts say we all want to be part of something larger than ourselves that will continue on, even after we die. Jeff Greenberg teaches social psychology at the University of Arizona. In the online science magazine Nautilus, he says:\nVoice 6 \n“The underlying importance of sports fanship is that need to feel good about yourself, the need for self-esteem and meaning. What is the point? Why do we need to feel valuable and good about ourselves and our place in the world? In a sense, that is what we are doing in our lives. We are trying to feel larger than our own lives, to feel higher than death. We want to feel that somehow we are going to continue on beyond. Sports are a symbolic version of the drama of life. Winning and losing feels like life and death.”\nVoice 1 \nPeople have found many ways to belong to groups. Sports fans form a strong bond with other group members. In this way they satisfy the need to belong. And they fill the need to be part of something larger than themselves. When their team loses, they feel as if they have lost. And when their team wins, they celebrate victory.\nVoice 2 \nLastly, there are some outside reasons to be a sports fan. Sports are a multi-billion dollar global business. It is good for people in this business when sports fans are loyal. Many people make a lot of money from sports that people watch. Sports are an important part of the global economy.\nVoice 1 \nMost people cheering for their team are probably not thinking about all these things. But it helps us to understand why sports are important to so many people around the world. Are sports important to you? What team do you support?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nTen men are on the court – five on each team. They are playing a game with an orange ball. They pass it back and forth. They bounce it on the hard gym floor. They are trying to get the ball through a hoop. The hoop is small and round, and high in the air. So the men must throw the ball with speed and accuracy. The teams try to block each other’s attempts to throw the ball. This is the world’s second most popular team sport – basketball.\nVoice 2  \nMany famous basketball players are from the United States. But not all! Manute Bol played for almost 10 years in the NBA – the National Basketball Association in the United States. He was not from the US, but from Sudan. For many years, he was the tallest player in the NBA. Many people remember him for playing basketball. Others remember him for how much he loved his home country of Sudan. Today’s Spotlight is about the life of Manute Bol.\nVoice 1  \nManute Bol was born in Sudan in a village of the Dinka people. His name means “special blessing.” Before Bol was born, his mother had two babies die. So his parents believed Bol was a special blessing. They hoped he would grow to take care of the family’s cows. But Bol always wanted to do more. He wanted to explore different places.\nVoice 2  \nThe Dinka are some of the tallest people in Africa. But Bol was tall even for the Dinkas! He was about 2.3 meters tall. When he was young, many people would watch him and laugh at him. Bol’s cousin remembered how difficult it was for Bol to be so tall. He told The Washington Post:\nVoice 3  \n“Manute did not like people to look at him. When he went to the market, traffic stopped. Many people stopped their cars and got out to laugh at him.”\nVoice 1  \nBol’s cousin thought Bol could be a very good basketball player. Another cousin told Bol that he could be rich and famous if he played in the United States. So Bol decided to try playing basketball.\nManute Bol at a Save Darfur event in 2006 “DSC_0119” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by United to End Genocide\nVoice 2  \nBol started playing for a small team in Khartoum. But he did not know how to play! But he worked hard and learned quickly. Tony Amin, the coach who guided and led the team, remembers teaching Bol how to play. He described one of the things Bol learned how to do:\nVoice 4  \n“Manute was very, very happy when someone shot the basketball and he blocked it. You do not find tall players like Manute on other teams. We were expecting a player like this would one day achieve something.”\nVoice 1  \nIn 1982, a coach from the United States saw Bol playing. He immediately brought Bol to the US to play basketball. Bol was tall, but he was not very strong. People made fun of him because of his height and body. One coach even said that Bol was so thin that he would break like an insect. Many people wondered why Bol was in the NBA. They thought he was a joke.\nVoice 2  \nBut those people were wrong. Bol started playing in the NBA in 1985. In his first year, he blocked 397 shots. This was an average of five shots each game. It was also a new record for a player in his first NBA season! He did not score many points. But Bol became famous for blocking shots. Some people even called him a “shot-blocking” machine! Bol played in the NBA for a long time. This is unusual. Many people get injured and leave basketball early. The average player only plays for five years. Yet Bol played in the NBA for almost 10 years! He played for four different teams.\nVoice 1  \nBol lived and worked in the United States. But he loved Sudan. And he never forgot his home country or the people who lived there. Around that time, Sudan was in the middle of war. Bol often travelled back to Sudan to help others. He supported family members who were living in Sudan during the war. Bol explained to Sports Illustrated:\nVoice 5  \n“God guided me to America and gave me a good job. But he also gave me a heart so I would look back.”\nVoice 2  \nBol worked for peace in Sudan. He encouraged the opposing sides to come together. He even took part in government peace talks. He spent much of his money helping Sudan.\nVoice 1  \nBut he also believed that education was very important. He believed that the way to achieve peace in Sudan would come through education. So he helped build a school in his home village of Turalei – the Manute Bol School. Then he had a bigger dream. Bol told The Telegraph:\nVoice 5  \n“My dream is to build schools across Sudan, because with education, you can have a good life, find a job, and improve… The children are the future of Sudan, no matter where they come from.”\n“R Manute Bol” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by United to End Genocide\nVoice 2  \nChildren continue to learn at the Manute Bol School that he helped build. Today, it has two buildings and six classrooms. And in February 2017, the students placed first in their county for their annual exams!\nVoice 1  \nBol’s plan was to build 41 schools throughout Sudan. But he was never able to build those schools. He died in 2010 from kidney failure and a rare skin condition. He was only 47 years old. When Bol died, one of his teams released a statement that described how Bol had influenced the world around him. It said:\nVoice 6  \n“He was a great basketball player. But people will remember him for how hard he worked. They will remember him working in his native Sudan and the cities in which he played.”\nVoice 2\n What about you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nTwo large men stand facing each other on a raised area. They stand inside a circle four and a half metres across. They show no emotion. A man moves around them. He wears colourful clothing. He will manage their fight. Thousands of people cheer for the two men. Everyone is waiting. Then the men begin. Their bodies smash together. Arms pull and hit. Legs push and bend. The crowd becomes louder. Suddenly, one man loses his balance. He is thrown to the ground. He has lost the match. The fight lasted only a few seconds. But that is what happens in Sumo.\nPhoto by Bob Fisher\nVoice 2\nToday’s Spotlight is on Sumo Wrestling. Sumo Wrestling is the national sport of Japan. There are two ways to win a Sumo fight. You can push your opponent outside the circle. Or you can make them touch the ground with any part of their body that is not their feet. It sounds simple. But Sumo is rich in tradition, customs, and complex rules.\nVoice 1\nThe Sumo wrestler is a powerful athlete. However, he does not look like most athletes. In most fighting sports, the fighters are divided by weight. Small people only fight other small people. But Sumo are not divided by weight, so being large helps. Sumo wrestlers weigh around 90 kilograms when they begin to train. Top Sumo weigh between 130 and 180 kilograms. The largest Sumo ever weighed 272 kilograms.\nVoice 2\nSumo compete wearing only a mawashi. This traditional clothing is one long piece of cloth. It goes around the fighter’s waist and between his legs. A fighter’s hair is long. If any hair touches the ground, the fighter will lose the fight. So fighters tie their hair high on their heads. There is a different way to tie the hair for each Sumo skill level.\nVoice 1\nThere are many skill levels in Sumo. This list of skill levels, called the Banzuke, is very important. If a Sumo wins, he moves up the list. If a Sumo loses, he will move down the list. Moving up the Banzuke brings honour. But it also means more money, freedom, and moving closer to becoming a yokozuna\nVoice 2\nA yokozuna is a great champion. A Sumo must win many fights to become a yokozuna. But he must also demonstrate grace and honour as he fights. His behaviour out of the competitions must also bring honour. Once he has become a yokozuna, he will be a yokozuna for life. If he does badly at a competition, he is expected to retire. In all the years of Sumo, only 68 men have become yokozuna.\nVoice 1\nThe Banzuke rankings also have meaning beyond the wrestling circle. Sumo train in a “stable”. Each stable has a trainer and group of Sumo that exercise together. Sumo compete by themselves. But these stables are similar to teams. Each stable has high and low ranked Sumo.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/granick/191590753/\nVoice 2\nThe higher ranked Sumo are very famous. They are like sports super-stars anywhere in the world. They have money, popularity, and status. But for those at the bottom of the Banzuke, life is very different.\nVoice 1\nSumo at the bottom of the Banzuke must rise early in the morning. They must serve the higher ranked Sumo. They must cook the meals. They must clean. They must do what they are told to do. Sumo the lower rankings are not given any money or permitted to go out at night. These are all reasons for them to work hard and win more fights.\nVoice 2\nSumo began 1500 years ago. The first Sumo fights were connected closely to the Shinto religion. They were part of a celebration that included dancing, theatre, and prayers for a good harvest. As time went on, Sumo became a way to train men for war. It was a measure of strength and power. But in 1603, Japan’s areas were united. This brought in a time of wealth and peace. Official Sumo organizations began. They established rules and traditions. Sumo was recognized as the national sport of Japan.\nVoice 1\nToday, many people see Sumo as only a sport. However, there are still symbols of the Shinto religion found in Sumo. For example, before a Sumo enters the circle to compete, he must throw salt before him. This is believed to purify the circle. Then the Sumo must lift one foot high in the air and then bring in down against the ground. This is believed to keep evil spirits away. Sumo fighters are not required to be Shinto. But the influence of Shinto still surrounds Sumo.\nVoice 2\nSumo is still popular in Japan today. But some people criticize the sport. This is for several reasons. First, only a limited number of foreigners may compete. Also, no women are permitted to be Sumo. Another problem is the long term health effects of the Sumo life. When a Sumo retires, he becomes much less active. This can lead to problems such as knee and back pain, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. Most Japanese men live until they are eighty years old. But most Sumo live less than sixty years.\nVoice 1\nAnother serious criticism of Sumo is corruption. That is, the winner of a fight is chosen before the fight begins. Because the rankings are so important, some Sumo are willing to exchange money for losing a fight. This may permit a lower ranked Sumo to move up the banzuke.\nVoice 2\nAnd finally, people are concerned about hazing. Hazing is when lower ranked Sumo are treated badly by higher ranked Sumo. In 2008, the leader of a stable and three Sumo were arrested over the death of a young Sumo. The leader of the stable had told the men to beat the boy. Even the leader had broken a bottle on the boy’s head. This was an extreme case. But in the world of Sumo, training methods are often kept secret.\nVoice 1\nTo people outside of Japan, Sumo may seem like a simple competition between two fighters. But it is a complex sport, full of tradition, language, and ceremony. It also has its problems. But it is an important part of the cultural history and social identity of Japan.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Adam Navis. The voices you heard were from the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nTwo people stand next to each other at the bottom of a tall wall. The wall is 15 metres high. On the wall are rocks. They are not real rocks, but colourful plastic shaped to look like rocks. The plastic rocks are placed at different spaces and positions to create a route, or path, up the wall. So each person has the same choices about where to put their feet and hands. Two climbers place their hands on the wall. They tense their bodies. They wait.\nVoice 2  \nWhen they get the signal to go, they race up the wall as fast as they can. They move so quickly they look as if they are running up the wall. When they reach the top, they hit a button with their hand. This marks their time. There is a rope that catches them and brings them slowly back to the ground. This is the sport of speed climbing. These races are only six or seven seconds long. This makes speed climbing the fastest sport in the world. Today’s Spotlight is on speed climbing – a new Olympic sport for 2020.\nVoice 1  \nIn 2020, the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Sports and events change at every Olympics. The 2020 games will add the sports of skateboarding, baseball and softball, karate, surfing, and climbing events.\nVoice 2  \nSports are added through a complex process. Olympics officials consider global popularity, cultural diversity, and if there are organizations that can help set the rules. But two other important goals are to reach younger people and to create an equal opportunity for men and women to perform in the games. With these new sports, especially surfing and climbing, officials hope to achieve these goals.\nMartin Rulsch, Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1  \nOfficials chose climbing because it has become more and more popular around the world. When you hear the word climbing, you may think of climbing a mountain. People have been climbing mountains for thousands of years. They climb to travel and explore and to have fun. But speed climbing is a little different.\nVoice 2  \nSpeed climbing does not happen on a mountain. It happens on a wall made by people. It usually happens inside a building. And this sport is becoming more and more popular. The International Federation of Sport Climbing, or IFSC, says that more than 140 countries have speed climbing walls. And 35 million climbers do this sport worldwide.\nVoice 1  \nThe IFSC makes exact rules for this new sport. They also designed the route. Every speed climbing route is the same all over the world, so everyone climbs the same path. Each route is either ten meters or 15 meters high. Brendan Blanchard is a climber who wrote about speed climbing for Climbing Magazine. He explained the sport like this,\nVoice 3  \n“The rules for the official IFSC speed climbing are simple. Climbers compete on the same path, side by side. The first to the top wins. Times are recorded by a device under the climber’s foot at the base of the path, and a sensor at the top. The path is always the same. Everyone can train on the same path at any climbing gym that has a speed wall.”\nVoice 2  \nSpeed climbing is not for everyone. Many people like to be on a real mountain. Other people do not want the risks of climbing so fast. But many people see it as a new challenge. They compare it to running up a wall! Top speed climbers come from places all over the world, like Spain, Italy, and China. Reza Alipour holds the world record for the 15 metre wall climb. He comes from the country of Iran. He climbed the 15 meter wall in only 5.48 seconds. He is so fast that people sometimes call him Persian Cheetah — the fastest animal in the world.\nVoice 1  \nMany athletes welcome the choice to include climbing in the next Olympics. They are excited to finally get a chance to compete at one of the world’s largest events. They will get to show the world how climbing is a fun and exciting sport. But they will also get to show what amazing athletes they are. They hope that this encourages more people to try climbing.\nVoice 2  \nBut the excitement about climbing at the Olympics is not just among people who may get to climb in the games. Many people also like to watch speed climbing. Mark Glennie directs the British national climbing team. He told The Guardian that,\nVoice 4  \n“More people know about the sport. And it clearly works as a sport people enjoy to watch. It is very like the sport of gymnastics. It is very exciting. But, it is also very easy to understand as a normal person.”\nVoice 1  \nBut not everyone thinks that speed climbing is a good thing. For many people who climb, climbing is more like a way of life than a sport. It is about more than speed or competition. It is about being on a rock or a mountain and giving yourself a challenge. Alex Honnold is one of the greatest free climbers in the world. Free climbers climb mountains without using ropes or other protection. Honnold’s climbs often take him hundreds of metres up a mountain with nothing to stop him from falling but his own hands. Would he consider taking part in speed climbing events? He told David Ferry of Outside Magazine that he would not be anywhere near the Japan Olympics.\nPhoto by Fionn Claydon\nVoice 5  \n“I would not even be able to qualify for these climbing events. Competitive climbing is basically a whole different sport.”\nVoice 2  \nFerry argues that the Olympics wants to attract young people, but they are doing it in the wrong way. He writes,\nVoice 5  \n“Young climbers do not want to watch the world’s best climbers climb on plastic rocks. They want to see climbers pulling hard on La Dura Dura, one of the most difficult sport routes in the world.”\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever climbed? Would you like to try speed climbing?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nThere is an ancient story told in Thailand. It happened in the 1700s. The story is set in the kingdom of Burma, which is now the country of Myanmar. At that time, Burma had defeated Thailand in a war. There were many Thai prisoners in Burma. The king of Burma decided to have a celebration. One event was a boxing competition. The king and other people watched. Burmese fighters fought against the Thai prisoners. There was one Thai fighter who beat everyone else. He even beat the best boxing teacher in Burma. His name was Nai Khanomtom. The King of Burma had a high opinion of Nai Khanomtom. He gave Khanomtom a very good prize. The king released him from prison. Khanomtom was free to move back to Thailand.\nVoice 2 \nToday, a similar thing is happening in Thailand. Siriporn Thaveesuk went to prison when she was only 17. Soon, she joined a boxing program. Three years later Thaveesuk won an international competition. And, like Nai Khanomtom, she won her freedom from prison.\nVoice 1 \nThaveesuk is one of many prisoners in Thailand who are training to be boxers. If they win, they will be closer to freedom. Today’s Spotlight is on Thai prisoners who improve their lives and gain their freedom through boxing.\nVoice 2 \nThai boxing is also called Muay Thai. Two Muay Thai fighters stand together in a square shaped fighting area. They wear short trousers but no shirts. Each of their hands and wrists are tightly wrapped with white rope. When the fight begins the fighters use their hands, elbows, knees and feet to hit each other. People cheer for the fighters. Muay Thai is a popular form of entertainment in Thailand.\nPhoto by Justin Ng\nVoice 1 \nPrisons in Thailand are using this form of entertainment for a new purpose. The Thai government began a program for boxing in prisons. Prisoners all around the country compete in Muay Thai fights. This provides entertainment but it also gives the prisoners something to do.\nVoice 2 \nMuay Thai is a very difficult sport. Fighters must be very strong. They must live a very healthy life. They spend many hours training their bodies. They also train their minds. They spend hours meditating and breathing. This training is helpful for prisoners. It is healthier than other activities such as smoking cigarettes or taking illegal drugs. Aree Chaloisuk is the director of Klong Pai prison. He tells Hemispheres magazine about the advantages of the program for the prisoners:\nVoice 3 \n“Muay Thai is a strong part of Thai culture. I think the fighters are proud to take part in the program. From what I have seen, it can improve bad behaviour. It provides a chance for a job for prisoners after they leave prison. They can compete instead of becoming criminals again.”\nVoice 1 \nPrisoners also train and fight for another reason. If they win their fights, they can reduce the time they have to stay in prison. Like in the story of Nai Khanomtom, prisoners can win their freedom through Muay Thai. One man working to do this is Chalernpol Sawangsuk. He is 26 years old. He is in prison for selling illegal drugs. But since he started practicing Muay Thai in prison, his life is different. Sawangsuk told Hemispheres magazine:\nVoice 4 \n“It was a big change to my life. I think the program has helped me to concentrate. I have slowed down. I think about things more. I am more reasonable. I have seen myself grow up. The other life, I think it is really behind me.”\nVoice 2 \nSawangsuk has won five fights. Through these, he has reduced his prison time by seven years. There are other prisoners who have been completely set free from prison. One of these is Amnat Ruenroeng. He is now on Thailand’s Olympic boxing team. Winning a place on the national boxing team is a dream for all of the fighters. It is a great chance to bring honor to their country.\nVoice 1 \nAn organization called Prison Fight works with the Muay Thai prison program. Their aim was to help prisoners reduce prison time. Today, they help by providing equipment to the Thai prisoners. Prison Fight also organizes local and international events with the Thai government. They believe it is also a good way to share Thai culture. So prisoners in Thailand sometimes fight people from other countries. One international Prison Fight event took place in January 2013. Thai prisoners fought against fighters from France, Myanmar, and other countries. The event was a great success. Saichon Somnet is the head coach at Klong Prem prison. He talks in a video about the event:\nVoice 5 \n“Today makes me happy and gives me a chance to share Muay Thai with people outside our country. It is very difficult for prisoners to get this kind of chance. I am very happy it is happening today.”\nPhoto by Alex Harmuth\nVoice 2 \nThere are good results for the rest of Thai society too. The Thai government says that none of the released boxers have ever been arrested for another crime. They hope that Muay Thai keeps people from doing illegal activities. It also gives prisoners new skills and chances for the future. Wanchai Roujanavong is the director general of Thailand’s Department of Corrections. He told TIME magazine:\nVoice 6 \n“People in prison have a lot of time. It is a good environment for dedicating yourself to boxing. The sport also provides new chances after prison. A lot of people have a difficult time finding jobs after they are released. But in boxing, no one cares about your history.”\nVoice 1 \nSome prisoners have even found that fighting gives them new hope. It even helps them fix past mistakes. A boxer named Black Lion has fought in many Muay Thai fights in prison. He tells TIME magazine that he hopes to improve himself and his relationships. Black Lion voices the hope of many prisoners:\nVoice 7 \n“I have made my mother sad for so long. I only finished first grade. I took drugs. Maybe with boxing and good concentration, I can fix myself and make my mother proud.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nIn 2007, Ryan Hall was running the Houston half marathon. The race is a little longer than 13 miles. Hall was having a great race. He was running each mile in about 4:20. He was even winning the race. But with only a few miles left, Hall felt his stomach tense and become very painful. This can happen during long, difficult exercise. It feels like there is a rock in your stomach.\nVoice 2  \nHall is a Christian believer. So he decided to pray – to talk to God. This is something he does every day. He talks to God about his hopes and fears. He talks to God about good things for his family. He talks to God about different ways to make the world a better place. So Hall decided to pray about this too. He told Outside Magazine that he prayed,\nRyan Hall, running in the 2012 Olympic Marathon in London, cropped imagePhoto by By Peter Mooney via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 3  \n“Lord, please help me get to the finish line without my stomach stopping me.”\nVoice 1  \nHe repeated this prayer for about a minute. Then the feeling in his stomach went away. He was able to continue to run. He even went on to win the race. In fact, he had one of the best races of his life. Hall says it was because of the power of prayer. Hall had trained for years as a runner, but the prayer seemed to give him something extra. But what was it? Today’s Spotlight is on the power of prayer in sport.\nVoice 2  \nThe human brain produces different signals depending on how the brain is working. These signals are called brainwaves. Scientists can measure these waves in a laboratory. Scientists can look at brainwaves and know if a person is sleeping or if they are thinking about a difficult problem.\nVoice 1  \nWhen a person is competing well in sport, their brain makes alpha brainwaves. The brain makes alpha waves when a person is calm and focused. They are not thinking too much. Many athletes call this being in “the zone” or “flow.” They report being able to perform their sport and not think too much about what they should do. They just act.\nPhoto by Jonathan Chng\nVoice 2  \nBut it is difficult for a person to force their brain to make alpha waves. Playing a sport is not something that is always calm and relaxed. There is a lot of pressure to perform well. Athletes try to find ways to be calm and focused. They often use a process called visualization.\nVoice 1  \nVisualization happens when athletes think about what they want to happen. Before they compete, they imagine how they will achieve their goal. They imagine a perfect performance. They imagine all the details. This helps them prepare for their sport. Visualization is similar to prayer in some ways. Both things happen in a person’s mind and claim to change the physical world.\nVoice 2  \nAndrew Newberg is a Neuroscientist. He studies the effect of religious acts like praying, on the human brain. He believes that prayer is more powerful than visualization.\nVoice 1  \nNewberg’s research shows that religious people are doing more than visualization. They believe what they are doing. This makes prayer stronger than visualization. Newberg told Outside Magazine,\nVoice 4  \n“The more you believe in whatever you are doing, the stronger the effect is going to be. If you are a religious person and your religion is important to you, then being able to pray can be very valuable.”\nPhoto by jose aljovin\nVoice 2  \nThis means that when people like Ryan Hall have very strong beliefs, their prayers in sport can help them. But while many people pray that they win their sport, there is more to prayer than winning. Being a Christian believer is not all about winning.\nVoice 1  \nThe Christian Bible says that when people follow the example of Jesus, their life will be full of love, joy, and peace. They will be patient, kind, and good. They will be faithful, gentle, and self-controlled. Reid S. Monaghan wrote for the organization Athletes in Action. He wrote about how when Christians pray during sports, they can pray about more than winning. He wrote,\nVoice 5  \n“We can be a very superstitious group as athletes. We think that if we do the right things before a game that things are going to go well in the game. There is some truth in this. Doing the same thing before every game helps us focus, calm the mind and prepare the body. Yet it is dangerous as Christians to mix God up into sport as if we are using him to make us win. Some of us pray before practices and games almost as if God will give us good luck if we do so – as if God is a lucky charm and our prayers will make us win. God is not our good luck charm.”\nVoice 2  \nMonaghan says that we should not see prayer as all about us. Prayer is about other people too. He wrote,\nVoice 5  \n“Many times during games we can forget that God is working in the lives of many people. During the game, what if you prayed for a struggling friend or someone whose anger is stopping them from their best play? What if we could move away from prayers only for us and learn to love God by thinking about other people? That would be a big change.”\nPhoto by Jeffrey F Lin\nVoice 1  \nAthletes who are followers of Jesus say that Christian prayer is not just a trick to be better at sport. It is a way to talk to God. In fact, for athletes like Ryan Hall, being a Christian athlete is not mostly about winning or losing. It is about living how God wants him to live. In an interview with Runner’s World Magazine, Hall said,\nVoice 3  \n“I believe that the Bible unlocks the perfect heart for athletes to compete from. The most important thing I can train is my heart. It is what drives the body. Christians should be able to compete with more freedom, less pressure and more joy. I have become better at being OK with whatever God has for me in a race.”\nVoice 2  \nDo you think prayer can help people? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nDuring World War II, American and British forces bombed the city of Dresden, Germany. More than 22,000 people died in this terrible act of war. The bombs also destroyed many works of art, literature, and music. A short time after the war, a musician named Remo Giazotto was in Dresden. He was looking through the remains of old buildings. He found some pieces of paper with notes on them. They were directions for playing music.\nVoice 2 \nGiazotto believed it was music by the famous 18th century musician Albinoni. But Giazotto only found part of the music. So he looked at the rest of Albinoni’s musical pieces. He used these to complete the piece of music he found. Most experts think that Giazotto wrote the music himself. But people still call the music “Albinoni’s Adagio.”\nThe ruins in Dresden in April 1945; “Germany, Dresden, Frauenkirche ruins” (CC BY-NC 2.0) by hdes.copeland\nVoice 1 \nThis song became a symbol. It shows that beauty can survive through conflict and war. Albinoni’s Adagio became even more famous during another war. In 1992, enemies surrounded the European city of Sarajevo. A musician named Vedran Smailović played Albinoni’s Adagio in the street. He played often, even though it was very dangerous. Today’s Spotlight is on the actions and influence of the cellist Vedran Smailović.\nVoice 2 \nIn the 1990s, the former country of Yugoslavia experienced a terrible conflict. Different ethnic groups in the country fought each other for control. For more than three and a half years, the city of Sarajevo was under siege. Enemy soldiers completely surrounded the city. They blocked important supplies coming in. Citizens could not leave Sarajevo. It was the longest siege in the history of modern war.\nVoice 1 \nThousands of people died during the Siege of Sarajevo. They could not get enough food or medical care. Many people were also killed by snipers. Sniper soldiers with guns hid in buildings. They shot people from far away, including children. Bombs also destroyed people’s homes and city hospitals. And, like Dresden, Sarajevo lost a lot of important cultural property.\nVoice 2 \nBefore the siege, Sarajevo had many wonderful artists and musicians. One important musician was named Vedran Smailović. He played a large stringed instrument called the cello. When the siege began, Smailović was hopeful about peace. He did not believe that the siege would last a long time. But on May 27th 1992, something changed him.\nVoice 1 \nIt was difficult to find food in Sarajevo at this time. One morning, many people stood in a long line. They were waiting for fresh bread at one of the last working bakeries. Suddenly, soldiers fired a bomb into the middle of the line. It killed 22 people and injured many others.\nVoice 2 \nAfter this tragic event, Vedran Smailović decided to use his cello to protest the war. Smailović held the large cello between his knees. With one hand he pressed four long strings. Smailović’s other hand pulled a long straight bow over the strings. He played beautiful music in the middle of the war. The song he played was Albinoni’s Adagio.\nThe siege of Sarajevo, 1992-1993. One man gathers firewood from branches and another man holds loaves of bread; Christian Maréchal, CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nSmailović played this song every day for 22 days. Each day represented one person who was killed at the bakery. Albinoni’s Adagio was a fitting piece of music to play. The history of the song was like Smailović’s act. It presented something beautiful in the middle of death and destruction. It was a song of hope. Every day Smailović chose a different place to play. He played in the middle of a street, or in a ruined home, or a bombed building. He even dressed up in a formal suit. This was the same suit that he used to wear to play for famous people.\nVoice 2 \nSmailović talked to a BBC reporter, Malcolm Brabant. He told Brabant that he wanted to make the world remember these people.\nVoice 3 \n“I play for the dead people. They are my friends, it is in my city, in my street, it is in my country. I play for my dead friends, and I play for the future, for a better future. It will be, I am sure.”\nVoice 1 \nSmailović did not stop playing his cello after his 22-day protest. He would often play at funerals. In August of 1992, bombs completely destroyed the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This library was the centre of knowledge and culture for the whole area. Smailović also played his cello in the remains of the destroyed library.\nVedran Smailović plays in the partially destroyed National Library in Sarajevo, 1992; Mikhail Evstafiev, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2 \nIn 1993, Smailović escaped from Sarajevo. But his courage gave many people hope. David Wilde is an English musician. He wrote a song for the cello called “Cellist of Sarajevo.” The song was about Smailović. In 1994, the world famous cellist Yo Yo Ma performed this song. He played it at the International Cello Festival in England. When Yo Yo Ma finished playing, he remained bowed over his instrument. The whole room was very quiet. Then, Yo Yo Ma stood up and raised his hand. To everyone’s surprise, Vedran Smailović walked forward! He had been watching the performance. Musician Paul Sullivan was there. He described it later in Hope magazine.\nVoice 4 \n“The emotion was unbelievable. Everyone jumped to their feet, cheering loudly, crying, shouting and putting their arms around each other. It carried us away in a huge wave of emotion. And in the centre of it stood these two men holding each other, both crying freely.”\nVoice 1 \nVedran Smailović’s example continues to give people courage in times of war and conflict. In April of 2015, a car bomb killed several people in Baghdad, Iraq. It was 20 years after the Siege of Sarajevo. Karim Wasfi is an Iraqi musician. He played his cello at the place of the bombing. We end today’s program with Wasfi’s moving words. He told the BBC,\nVoice 5 \n“I want to bring beauty in the life of Iraq now. Music is one of the most important ways to do that. I cannot stop the bombs with my cello. But I will continue to make music to show life is still worth experiencing and living.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA crowd of people is standing in a circle. They are watching a young man perform. There is a music player next to him. It is playing loud music with a strong beat. He is performing amazing dance moves. The young man is spinning on his head. He is jumping and flipping with the music. He is wearing a hat and large trousers. The hat helps his head slide across the surface. And the large trousers hide thick pads that cover and protect his knees.\nVoice 2\nThis young man is not performing just any normal dance. This kind of dance is called “breaking” or “breakdance.” A dancer who does this kind of dance is a “bboy” or “bgirl.” Today’s Spotlight is on breaking and the people who perform it.\nVoice 1\nBreaking began in the United States in the 1970s. A man called Kool Herc liked to have parties at his home in New York City. He played music and people danced. He was very skilled at mixing the songs together and playing the best parts of each song.\nVoice 2\nEach song had a part where the words stopped, but the music continued. The music had only quick drumming and rhythm. This was called the “break” of the song. Kool Herc played these parts over and over. People danced longer when he played more breaks. They called the dance ‘breaking.’ And Kool Herc called the dancers at his parties ‘bboys’ and ‘bgirls.’\nDJ Kool Herc; By Mika Väisänen – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=38430378\nVoice 1\nKool Herc’s parties also began a new part of culture. It was based around a particular kind of music. People called it Hip Hop. Breaking is just one part of Hip Hop. It includes different kinds of music: rapping and DJing. It also includes graffiti. This is the art of painting words and pictures on walls, often without permission.\nVoice 2\nOver time, bboys and bgirls created different kinds of basic steps to breaking. The first is called ‘Toprock’. This is when the dancer jumps around on his feet when he first begins dancing. He listens to the rhythm of the music and first starts moving.\nVoice 1\nThe second kind of step in breaking is called ‘Downrock’. This part of breaking uses the hands and feet on the floor. A dancer moves around on the floor in creative ways. Her hands and feet equally support her movements. She rolls and turns. She moves her arms and legs around into shapes.\nVoice 2\nThe most difficult part of breaking is ‘power.’ This move requires a lot of skill and strength. A dancer’s head and shoulders are near the ground. But his legs are in the air. In this position, he turns in a fast circle. This kind of move often makes the crowd very happy.\nVoice 1\nThe last kind of move is a ‘freeze.’ This is when the dancer suddenly stops moving in a surprising position. She stays very still when the music changes or stops. A dancer may also end her dance with a move called a “suicide”. In this move, a dancer acts as if she is going to fall. It looks painful and dangerous. But she controls her fall so she is not hurt.\nA freeze. Image by Zlatko Jankovski from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nIn the 1980s, breaking became very popular. Bboys and bgirls appeared on television. They danced in movies. Suddenly, everyone knew about this special dance!\nVoice 1\nThese television performances were the first time many people saw women dancing in this way. The bgirls flipped and danced just like the bboys. They performed difficult dance moves. They were just as strong and creative as the bboys. This surprised many people watching the performance.\nVoice 2\nToday there are still many more bboys than bgirls. Breaking takes a lot of strength. It is a powerful dance. Many people see the dance as only for men. But more and more women are learning. There are special groups and competitions only for women.\nVoice 1\nIn fact, competitions are important to breaking. Breaking competitions are called battles. Two groups of dancers compete against each other. Each group stands on one side of a circle. People gather around the circle to watch the competition. A DJ starts to play music. Three judges sit at the edge of the circle and watch.\nVoice 2\nThe first person goes to the middle of the circle and breaks. When he is done, a dancer from the other team dances in the center. She tries to dance better than the first person. Each person from each group dances once in the middle of the circle.\nVoice 1\nAfter every person from both groups has danced, the judges choose a winning group. The judges choose the team with the most skill, best attitude, and the most interesting moves. After the battle, the groups often talk to each other. They shake hands with each other. When the battle is over, they often become friends. They have learned to respect each other’s creativity and skill.\nVoice 2\nBattles like this are one way that breaking builds communities. Sometimes people who do not agree can meet together for a battle. They compete with each other through dance instead of violence. They learn to respect each other. Sometimes dancers even meet together to practice after the battle. They learn from each other.\nVoice 1\nBreaking has this effect all over the world. There are bboys and bgirls on every continent. The dance is a little different in each country. But the style and basic steps are the same.\nVoice 2\nOften, people combine breaking with other kinds of performance. People in Japan and South Korea combine breaking with martial arts. These fighting sports include karate, kung fu, and taekwondo. Breakers add kicks and punches to the dance. They move in short, quick motions. Their clothes also show an influence from martial arts. These dancers may wear traditional breaking clothes and martial arts clothes together. They may wear white pants. Or they may wear a colored piece of cloth around their heads.\nImage by Shaun Stanich from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nIn Brazil, dancers add the fighting sport of capoeira to their breaking. They move around the floor with straight legs. They create shapes in the air with their arms and legs. They move very smoothly when they dance.\nVoice 2\nIn South Africa, dancers add traditional tribal dance steps to their breaking. They pump their hands in the air. They step their feet hard on the ground. They dance with strength and energy.\nVoice 1\nIn the United States, bboys and bgirls add the sport of gymnastics to their dance. They balance their bodies on their arms. They jump and flip in the air.\nVoice 2\nBreaking is more than just a dance. It is an important way to build community. Around the world people have discovered how this dance can bring people together.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Liz Waid.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight, I’m Ryan Geertsma.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThis song is called “Pop Pop Pop.” It is sung by the female music group Rania. Rania is a popular or ‘pop’ music group from South Korea. There are six girls in the group. They sing, dance, and create some of the most popular music in Asia. They also travel all around Asia and perform their music. Rania is a “KPOP” music group. The “k” in KPOP comes from the word “Korean.”  But People all over Asia listen to KPOP. The songs are top hits in many countries – countries as far away from South Korea as the Philippines. Today’s Spotlight is on KPOP.\nVoice 2 \nKorean Popular Music – or, KPOP – is similar to American and British “Pop” music. The term “Pop” music became famous in the 1950s. People used the term to describe popular rock and roll music.  Like early “Pop” music, KPOP uses a lot of very fast beats. The music often repeats and is very easy to remember.\nVoice 1 \nAmerican hip-hop music has also had a large influence on KPOP. Hip-hop started to become popular in the United States in the 1970s. It had many influences – like jazz and rock and roll music. Hip-hop is different than most music.  In most music, the performer sings the words. But in hip-hop, the performer speaks the words to the beat. The first famous hip-hop song was called “Rapper’s Delight.” It was performed by a band called The Sugarhill Gang. It sounds like this,\nVoice 2 \nYou can hear this kind of singing or rapping in many KPOP songs. It is even in the “Pop, Pop, Pop” song from the beginning of this program. The singer raps in Korean to the beat of the song:\nVoice 1 \nKPOP music is also very easy to dance to. The rhythm or beat is clear and easy to follow.  Restaurants, bars and dance clubs all over Asia play KPOP for people to dance to. It is rare to find KPOP songs that are slow. This is because making the song easy to dance to is extremely important. The beat and sound are often even more important than the words.\nVoice 2 \nKPOP shares many similarities with other kinds of global popular music. However, there is one thing that makes it unique or different. KPOP often combines the Korean and English languages. For example, there is a song called “Bad Girl, Good Girl” by Miss A. This song starts in English. It says, “You don’t know me, so shut up boy.” Then it quickly changes into Korean. Listen:\n“Miss A” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by kiki bondol\nVoice 1 \nThis use of English in KPOP is not surprising.  Most young Koreans speak some English or are learning English. Often, they speak what people call “Konglish.”  Konglish is a mixture of Korean and English. Often Koreans will speak mostly Korean, but use some English words instead of Korean words.  Sometimes, they will even use long groups of English words.  However, these phrases will be highly influenced by Korean.\nVoice 2 \nTory Thorkelson is a professor at Hangyang University in South Korea. He says that Konglish often borrows words from English. But sometimes these English words are given new, Konglish meanings.\nVoice 1 \nA good example is the word ‘meeting.’ In English, meeting means – the act of two or more people coming together.  A meeting can be for work, school, community or even religion. However, in Konglish, “meeting” means a particular kind of meeting. It is a meeting between two people. They are looking for love and they have never met before. In English, people would call this a “blind date.” In Konglish, it is just a “meeting.”\nVoice 2 \nKPOP’s international success is also changing how some cultures see South Korea. Sue Jin Lee is a Communications student at Elon University in the United States. She wrote a research paper about the Korean wave. The Korean wave is a term people use to explain the spread of Korean popular culture in Asia. She writes,\nVoice 3 \n“The clearest effect that the Korean wave has had is improving the Korean national image. South Korea is reinventing their national image. Countries in the world are always shaping and reshaping their national images. They do this as they compete with other countries for power and influence.”\nVoice 1 \nKPOP is a major part of the Korean wave.  And it has helped change the way Asian countries see South Korea.  Lee writes,\nVoice 3 \n“Many experts and news writers have questioned why Korean popular culture became such a powerful force in Asia. Most people like cultural products that are similar to their own culture. So, it is not surprising that Korean cultural products are successful. Asian people feel closer to Korean culture than to Western culture.”\nVoice 2 \nHowever, some people think KPOP and the Korean wave have given South Korea too much cultural influence and power.  Lee writes,\nVoice 3 \n“When the Korean wave first developed and moved into Asia, Japanese newspapers had a hostile attitude toward Korean issues. Chinese newspapers criticized the increase in Korean television shows and businesses…”\nVoice 1 \nHowever, no one can argue KPOP’s global appeal. It is crossing cultural divisions.  And it is building relationships between countries.\nVoice 2 \nIn fact, the spread of KPOP has not stopped with Asia. Its influence is spreading around the world. Donika Sterling is a 15-year-old girl from New York City. She suffers from a disease with no cure. She cannot walk. And she has gone through many operations to fight her disease. Her life is different than many girls her age. But like many people her age, she loves music – in particular KPOP.\nVoice 1 \nDonika loves to listen to KPOP over the internet.  And in June of 2012, she went on a very exciting trip. She travelled to Seoul, South Korea.  There, she met members of her favorite KPOP music groups.\nVoice 2 \nThis experience was powerful both for Donika and the KPOP groups she met. Donika told the Internet website KPOPstarz:\nVoice 4 \n“I still cannot believe I am in Korea. I thank everyone who helped me make my dreams come true.”\nVoice 1 \nSHINee is a member of the KPOP group Taemin. He told KPOPstarz,\nVoice 5 \n“I was happy to hear about Donika coming to Korea to meet us. I was very amazed to hear that Donika is encouraged by our music.”\nVoice 2 \nDo you listen to KPOP music?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIn the past 100 years people have invented only one popular musical instrument that does not use electricity. Do you know what it is? It sounds like this.\nVoice 2 \nHave you heard music like this before? It is called a steel pan. There are hundreds of different groups playing steel pan music. It is played for presidents and for kings. It is played in famous music centres. But steel pan music is connected most closely to one place: the island countries of Trinidad and Tobago. Today’s Spotlight is on steel pan music.\nVoice 1 \nThe history of Trinidad and Tobago is full of struggle. Over the years, many countries have occupied Trinidad and Tobago. At different times, Spain, The Netherlands, France, and Britain have each controlled these islands. People also came to the islands to escape from trouble or trial in their home country.\nVoice 2 \nWhile many people came because they wanted to, many did not. The French brought African people to the island as slaves. Soon there were more enslaved people than free people. Around the year 1800 there were about 17,000 people on the islands. Ten thousand of these people were enslaved. Several years later, Britain took control of the islands and banned the slave trade.\nVoice 1 \nThe French did not only bring slaves to the islands. They also brought the tradition of Carnival. Carnival is also called Mardi Gras. It is a celebration before the Christian season of Lent. As they did in Paris, French people marched through the streets singing, dancing, and playing music. The former slaves joined the parade too. They brought their own drums and began adding their own beats to the celebration.\nVoice 2 \nPeople usually make drums by stretching animal skin over an open container. On the islands, people used these drums to communicate across great distances. Although the British ruler had banned the slave trade, the British would not give up control of the islands. And they were afraid the people would use the drums to send secret messages of revolt. So, in 1883, Carnival was celebrated but the government banned the drums.\nVoice 1 \nMany people did not want to give up their drums. The enslaved people had lost many things – their families, their own languages, and their religion. Music was one connection to the past. And drumming gave them a way to express their emotions without words. Also, they missed out on taking part in celebrating Carnival.\nVoice 2 \nSo people found a way to keep drumming. Every time the government banned one kind of drum, the people found a new one. For example, people started to use bamboo. This plant grows in a large tube shape. The people would cut different sizes of bamboo and strike them together or hit them on the ground. This was called Tamboo Bamboo.\nVoice 1 \nThe Tamboo-Bamboo groups soon became large. They even began to fight over who was the best. Some even made their instruments into sharp pointed weapons. Also, many people were harvesting bamboo illegally. So in 1934 the British government banned Tamboo-Bamboo instruments.\nVoice 2 \nThis did not stop people from inventing more new drums. In 1936, a music group brought new steel drums to Carnival. This was the beginning of steel pan.\nVoice 1 \nPeople made these first steel pans from bread containers, paint containers, or waste containers. They were so popular that soon the young people of Trinidad were stealing every waste container they could find. Young people even took locked waste containers!\nVoice 2 \nSterling Betancourt grew up in Trinidad and Tobago. He told the BBC how people invented the steel pan. It was never a plan. He says:\nVoice 3 \n“It was a very slow process. Everyone got together and invented the steel pan by using pots and pans and testing them out. The sound and the notes came. But we did not think about it — we just did it.”\nVoice 1 \nThey made steel pans by shaping the bottom of the containers with heavy tools. They shaped different thicknesses on different parts. This created many notes on a single pan. The steel pan was now able to play whole songs! It was still a drum, but a new kind of drum.\nVoice 2 \nDuring World War Two the music of steel pan became popular with American soldiers. They were living at a navy base in Trinidad. The navy base also brought a new resource for making steel pan instruments: oil containers!\nVoice 1 \nThe navy ships needed oil. The oil came in large 208-liter containers. When the containers were empty, they were perfect for making steel pans. The oil containers were thick metal and lasted much longer than other materials.\nVoice 2 \nAfter World War Two began the most popular time for steel pan music. Music groups set up steel pan music celebrations. Different steel pan groups would gather and compete against each other. As Trinidad and Tobago became more independent, steel pan became a more respected kind of music.\nVoice 1 \nIn 1962, Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation. Steel pan music was played at the national celebration. This was an important event for steel pan as well as for Trinidad and Tobago. This music was once banned street music. But now it had risen into a respected music form. It was part of Trinidad and Tobago’s national character.\nVoice 2 \nToday, steel pan music has travelled around the world. Now people outside Trinidad and Tobago play it too. There are more than 800 steel pan groups in the world. Three hundred are in Britain. There are 240 in the United States. In Switzerland, there are 130 groups and 70 percent of Swiss pan players are women.\n\n\nVoice 1 \nEven while it is popular around the world, steel pan music is still closely linked with the culture of Trinidad and Tobago. Steel pan was the music of the poor, of the oppressed, and of former slaves. But like the people of Trinidad and Tobago, steel pan music rose up and demanded to be heard.\nVoice 2 \nDo you enjoy steel pan music?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThis beautiful music is made with a sitar. This is a traditional musical instrument from India. It looks a bit like another popular instrument called a guitar. On one end of the sitar is a round empty gourd. This deep rounded base makes the sound louder and more complex. From this base comes a long flat stick called the “neck.” Almost 30 strings, like thin ropes, go up and down the neck. The sitar player plays seven of these strings. He pulls on them with his fingers. The remaining strings make noise as the musician plays the other strings above them.\nVoice 2 \nThis instrument is very complex and beautiful. It is one of the major instruments in the traditional music of India. But people all around the world know and love sitar music. How did this instrument become popular in countries far from India? There is one musician who helped encourage people’s love of sitar music more than anyone else. Some people call him the father, or founder, of world music. Today’s Spotlight is on the famous Indian musician Ravi Shankar.\n\n\nVoice 1 \nRavi Shankar was born in India in 1920. When he was 10 years old he moved to Europe. His brother led a dance group that performed traditional Indian music and dancing. Shankar learned to dance and joined his brother’s group. Shankar also learned about many cultures and customs. He learned many kinds of music. But he loved music from India the best. Shankar noticed that people from other cultures also loved Indian music. He told the writer Thakur Paramjit:\nVoice 3 \n“I listened carefully to our music. I observed the reaction of audiences on hearing it. This watching and judging helped me. I decided what we should give to Western audiences to make them respect and enjoy Indian music.”\nVoice 2 \nWhen he turned 18 Ravi Shankar moved back to India. He went to live with a famous musician named Allauddin Khan. Khan became Shankar’s teacher and spiritual guide. Shankar spent six years living and studying with Khan. He learned classical Indian music styles and instruments. But the instrument Shankar loved most was the sitar.\nVoice 1 \nShankar soon became a well-known musician and composer in India. He wrote music for the National Theatre. He worked as the director for All India Radio for many years. Shankar established the Indian national orchestra in the mid-1950s. People in India loved Ravi Shankar’s music. He performed in many live concerts. Shankar also wrote and performed music for some of the most popular Indian films at the time.\nVoice 2 \nRavi Shankar’s fame began to spread beyond India too. Many people in other countries began to enjoy sitar music. Western musicians became interested in learning to play Indian traditional music. They even played western and eastern music together. They made music that mixed the traditions from different countries and cultures. This style of music is sometimes called world music.\nVoice 1 \nRavi Shankar became friends with many famous people. One of the most famous was the British musician George Harrison. Harrison was a member of the rock band The Beatles. He first met Shankar in London. Then Harrison visited Shankar in India. Shankar taught Harrison to play the sitar. Soon, millions of people heard sitar music in songs by The Beatles. Ravi Shankar told Shashi Vyas in an interview:\nVoice 3 \n“I was one of the first when I first started to experiment with western instruments and western musicians. George Harrison came to me because he was so interested in our music. And he became my student. He did not do it only because it was popular at the time. He loved it until the end and became very very dear to me.”\nVoice 2\n Ravi Shankar played his sitar in many concerts all over the world. The largest event that Shankar organized was a concert for Bangladesh. At that time, there were many problems in Bangladesh. Ravi Shankar wanted to help. He asked George Harrison to help him organize a concert for Bangladesh. It became a huge music event. Shankar, Harrison and others gathered 250,000 US dollars for the people of Bangladesh.\n\n\nVoice 1 \nBecause Ravi Shankar had a great influence on music all over the world, some people criticised him for not being traditional enough. But Shankar always kept an Indian approach to music. He said:\nVoice 3 \n“I have experimented with non-Indian instruments, even electronic ones. But all my experiences were based on traditional Indian songs. When people discuss tradition, they do not know what they are talking about. Over centuries, classical music has had elements added to it. It has had changes and improvements. But it has always held to its traditional base. Today, the difference is that the changes are faster.”\nVoice 2 \nRavi Shankar often played with musicians who used other styles of music. But he always kept the important parts of Indian folk music. For example, he was always free to change the music while playing. Even when playing with many other musicians Shankar would not always follow the music exactly as it was written. He would play what he felt sounded good. He did not always follow the set rules that some western music uses. Shankar told Sashi Vyas:\nVoice 3 \n“Music rises above all languages and barriers. It is the most beautiful communication skill one can have. Music makes us all experience different emotions. Different kinds of music, whether it is by voice or instrument, Eastern or Western, Classical or Pop or folk from any part of the world, can all be spiritual. Music has the power to move the spirit of a person as if there is no time.”\nVoice 1 \nThis power to move people’s spirits was Ravi Shankar’s gift through music. He died in 2012 at the age of 92. Ravi Shankar was more than a sitar player. He was also a teacher and example for many people.  His two daughters, Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar, are also both successful musicians. Musician Lalgudi Jayaraman explains exactly why people will never forget Ravi Shankar:\nVoice 4 \n“His connection with music was driven by reason all through. The high quality of his music shows that spirit. Ravi Shankar loved and enjoyed good music. He came to it with child-like excitement even after becoming a world-known master. Only such an attitude to art can bring out influential music like his.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writers of this program were Shelagh Godwin and Rena Dam. The producer was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are in school. Picture the students sitting in their seats. And think of the teacher, standing at the front of the room. How are you feeling in this moment? Are you excited to learn? Interested? Are you participating in discussion? Or are you bored? Maybe you are falling asleep, watching the clock, or flirting with a classmate? Your thoughts say a lot about you as a student. But they also say a lot about your teacher.\nVoice 2\nBeing a teacher is very important. Teachers can be parents, professors, or even friends. But teaching is also very difficult. Each person learns differently. Some people learn better by seeing. Others learn better by reading. Some learn better by hearing. And still others learn best by doing. Some methods of teaching work best for certain subjects. Teachers must know how to best teach each different student. Have you ever tried to teach someone? Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good teacher.\nVoice 1\nOne of the most important parts of being a good teacher is understanding how people remember things. People naturally remember things that are interesting to them. Interesting facts are easy to memorize. But information that can be used directly in someone’s life is even better. Imagine a history class. It is very difficult to learn the names of famous people who lived long ago. Event dates are difficult to remember. But if you were learning the history of another country where you were going to move, things might be different. It might be very important that you know the information.\nVoice 2\nPeople also learn better when they can connect the subject to something they already know. Imagine teaching someone to repair a car. If they have no experience with machines, it could be very difficult. But if they had worked on engines before, it would be easier. This is true of all subjects, whether it is language, art, or mathematics. We remember things that are useful to us. And if we do not have context, our minds will not recognize information. This is true even if you believe what you are learning is important. It might be very important to repair your car engine. But if you do not know the parts of an engine and what they do, you will not be able to learn. A good teacher will help connect new information to something you already understand. Or they will give you a wider base of knowledge to understand.\nVoice 1\nAnother important part of teaching is learning to understand and care about your students. This means learning who they are. Not all students are the same. And some are going through things you do not know about. Suzanne Tingley is a teacher. She wrote on the blog Hey! Teach:\nVoice 3\n“A friend of mine teaches at a high school where 44 languages are spoken. She told me she heard a student say, “I am really tired. Last night, I slept next to someone who snored.” Kids may be dealing with issues we know nothing about. Do not assume video games are to blame when work is not complete.”\nVoice 2\nA good teacher also knows their subject very well. And they know how students think about it. Teachers must be able to correct students when they are wrong. A good teacher provides constructive criticism often. Constructive criticism corrects student’s mistakes. It gives them ideas for how to improve.\nVoice 1\nMany people do not like to criticize. Criticizing may seem rude. Criticism can lead to shame and bad feelings when it is not planned out. But teachers must learn how to criticize in a way that is helpful. Brooke Chaplan is a writer at The Edvocate. She explains how to criticize correctly.\nVoice 3\n“Constructive criticism is something that should always be shared in private. Begin by telling the student the good things you see about him or her. This will get you started in a good way. Then, tell them what you think is delaying their progress. Then, tell them how they can make a positive change. After, remind them that you believe in them as an individual. If you share your concerns in the right way, it is possible that the student will do what you suggested.”\nVoice 2\nFinally, it is important to let your students be creative. They should not be afraid to ask their own questions. Much teaching in the past treated children as listeners only. Teachers gave students knowledge, and students accepted it. If a student could not learn, teachers decided the student was not intelligent enough. But today, we know that learning works differently. Students learn best when they believe they have the power to ask and explore. Sometimes, it is even good when they get things wrong!\nVoice 1\nImagine a mathematics class. The teacher shows you a problem. And then, she shows you how to solve the problem. You memorize the formula and will use it later on tests. Then, you will forget it. But what if, instead, your teacher asks you how you would solve the problem? You might not know the correct formula. But you can guess and work it out yourself. You think about the problem for several minutes. When you finish, your answer might be incorrect. And your teacher will finally tell you the answer. But while you are working on the problem your attitude changes. The question becomes a puzzle. Now, you want to know the answer to this puzzle. You care about the answer. And you have learned to think on your own.\nVoice 2\nToday, most good teachers know to change their lessons to fit their students. They learn about and care about their students. They know that that learning is not about remembering everything you hear. But more than anything, they know they are not just teaching their subjects. They teach their students how to learn. And they teach them how to think for themselves. People who know how to think and learn will continue to grow. They can change more quickly when required to. And they will live fuller lives.\nVoice 1\nWho was your favorite teacher? Why do you think they were so good? Are you a good teacher?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Roger Basick. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nOmar was a first-year university student. He had done very well in his studies before. But now that he was at university, he started having problems. Some of the ideas he was supposed to learn felt too complicated. And he was suddenly in a new environment. He had new friends and new activities to explore. He found it difficult to know when he should study. How much should he study? And what were the best ways to study?\nVoice 2\nDoes this sound familiar to you? Learning can be difficult, in or out of school. Sometimes, we forget too quickly. Or the material can seem too difficult. But there are many different reasons why we do or do not learn a subject. And there are ways of studying that are more effective than others. In today’s Spotlight we will look at some of these methods. Today’s Spotlight is on how to be a good student.\nVoice 1\nThe first step to being a good student is having confidence in yourself. Often, students who are having a difficult time believe it is because they are not intelligent.  But this is not true! Learning is how you become intelligent. All of us begin, as children, with no knowledge. From there, we learn and grow. Being a student means continuing this process. It means knowing you may not seem intelligent now, but you will be. Believing that you can learn is the most important step in being a good student. Geoff Nixon is a writer at Gemm Learning. He writes about the importance of confidence.\nVoice 3\n“Confidence is important in learning at any age. When we feel confident, we are more likely to try new things. That will help us improve our abilities. It will help us build on things we already know. Confidence drives resiliency. This is the ability to recover when something has gone wrong and try again.”\nVoice 2\nThe second step of being a good student is understanding what kind of learning you prefer. Take language learning as an example. Some people learn language best by listening. They might learn well by listening to podcasts, audiobooks, or even Spotlight English! But other people learn best by doing. It helps them to apply the knowledge. They might need to speak to others to learn best. Some people are social learners, and study best with others. Others must be alone to learn. Understanding what style of learning you like can help you enjoy studying more. And, when you enjoy studying, you will be better at it.\nVoice 1\nBeing a good student also means taking care of yourself. Our brains work better when our bodies are healthy. This means eating well, drinking lots of water, and taking time for breaks. The Feinberg School of Medicine is a university in the United States. Its students take very difficult tests to become doctors. They study for months and take an eight-hour examination. One successful student spoke to school staff after her test. She shared her secret of success: staying healthy!\nVoice 4\n“I do not care if I am the 1000th person to say it. It is important, so I will say it again: Sleep, eat well and exercise. Honestly, I think that was the most important thing I did. I focused better. And I learned better on days when I was doing those things.”\nVoice 2\nAnother way to learn more effectively is to make a routine. Have special times each week when you study. And study even if you do not feel like it. Studying is not always entertaining. You may not always want to do it. But having a routine will force you to focus.\nVoice 1\nRoutines are also important in reducing stress. And stress can make learning more difficult. If you are stressed, you are not thinking about what you are studying. You are thinking about your stress. Kali Patrick is a psychologist. She wrote on entrepreneur.com about the importance of routine. She said that “when you do not have a plan, life is uncertain. When you have no idea what is going to happen, you can feel worried, anxious, and out of control. Your fear response can turn on. Routines reduce stress naturally. They give some control back to you”.\nVoice 2\nGood students also study over many days. They do not try to study everything all at once. Instead, it is better to repeat the same information several times over a longer period.  Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist. He also studied memory. In 1885, he discovered that people forget at a fixed rate. If we learn a fact once, we lose that information quickly. But, if we learn it again after a short period, it will stay in our memories. The more we repeat it, the more we remember.\nVoice 1\nFinally, good students ask questions. This may seem frightening at first. Asking a question may show that you do not know about a subject. And that can cause shame and embarrassment. But if you do not ask, no one will be able to help. Questions are how we naturally seek answers. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. She studies the science of learning. She wrote that “Asking questions is what our brains were born to do. At least, this is the case when we were children. For young children, quite literally, seeking answers is just as important as seeking food or water.”\nVoice 2\nIf you can keep all of these tips in mind, they may help you be a better student and learner!\nVoice 1\nNow, we have some questions for you.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nAnkit Talwar worked on the streets of Delhi, India. He sold clothes for children. This helped him learn business skills. But this was not Talwar’s main job. He was also an engineering student. Talwar wanted to continue his studies in Europe. So he studied to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language, the TOEFL.\nVoice 2 \nTalwar studied very hard. And he won scholarship money to study engineering at a university in Spain. The scholarship paid many of Talwar’s school costs. Talwar won the scholarship for hard work in many areas of his life. But he mainly got it because of his high score on the TOEFL exam. Not all people do as well as Talwar on the TOEFL. But many people around the world take this test every year. Today’s Spotlight is on the TOEFL test.\nVoice 1 \nExperts at Stanford University in the Unites States created the TOEFL in 1964. They saw that many people wanted to study in universities in the US and other English-speaking countries. But these schools needed to know that people coming from other countries could communicate well in English. The schools wanted to accept international students. And they wanted these students to be successful in English-speaking universities. So, they needed to test international students’ English language skills before admitting them.\nVoice 2 \nThere are different tests to determine a person’s English language skills. Each university decides which test it will give. However, most choose the TOEFL. Another test universities may choose is the International English Language Testing System or IELTS. To get a job or enter a school, most English-speaking universities require international students to pass these tests. That way, they can learn well in classes that are taught in English.\nVoice 1 \nMost people who take the TOEFL are students. But some people take the TOEFL or the IELTS for other reasons. Some workplaces require a language test. It can be helpful for moving to an English-speaking country. And many professional programs require a test too. For example, a doctor who is moving from India to the US may have to take the TOEFL. This may be needed for approval to do her job in a new country.\nImage by Dan Bui from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nNo matter what a person’s reason is for taking the TOEFL, he or she takes the same test – the TOEFL is standardized. There are over 4000 places that give the TOEFL. People in over a hundred different countries take it. But every person takes the same test. Experts then mark the test and give the person a score. The experts do not know whose test they are marking. This kind of test is more fair.\nVoice 1 \nPeople taking the TOEFL must go to an official testing site to take the exam. They must pay to take the exam. They usually sit in a room at a small table or at a computer. The room may be very full of other people also taking the test. For many years, students took the TOEFL on paper. Sometimes people still take the TOEFL this way. But since 2005, most people take the test on computers.\nVoice 2  \nThe TOEFL looks at four different skills in English: reading, listening, speaking and writing. Students read or listen. Then they answer questions about what they have read or heard. They must also record themselves speaking English. And they must write some longer essays in English. It usually takes about four hours to take the TOEFL. But people prepare for much longer than that.\nImage by Lorenzo Cafaro from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nMadison is a student from Romania. She spent six months studying for the TOEFL. After the test, she was afraid that she did not do well. She tells her story about studying on the website urch dot com:\nVoice 3  \n“I needed to take an English test in order to study for a degree in the United Kingdom. I bought a TOEFL preparation book. I found this book very useful. I honestly could not have prepared without it. Whatever mistakes I made, I do not think they were caused by a lack of preparation. Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with my performance. But me and everybody in the same position: we have to try again. Failure cannot get us down.”\nVoice 2  \nMadison did not have to try again. One week later she found she had a good score on the TOEFL! But doing well on the TOEFL can be difficult for some people. They may not be as prepared as Madison. Or they may have been distracted in the testing room. Sometimes testing rooms are full of people. Many people are recording themselves speaking. It can be difficult for students to do well in this environment.\nVoice 1  \nStudying for and taking the TOEFL can be stressful. But many people must take it. And lots of people have already used the TOEFL to follow their plans for work or study. We end today’s program with some good advice from people who have taken the TOEFL successfully:\nVoice 2  \nKim Min-Woo is a student and scholarship winner from Korea. In the Korea Times he talked about his experience. He told people taking the TOEFL that it is important to practice hearing, reading and speaking English:\nVoice 4  \n“Try to hear and see English often. Speak as much as possible. The best way to improve speaking is to practice. Speaking to one’s friends and English teachers would definitely help. Always keep in mind that practice makes perfect.”\nImage by annemcdon from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nAna Barbu from Romania found a way to study while enjoying television shows and films. She told US News:\nVoice 5\n“Subtitles on films helped me increase my understanding of English idioms. I learned how native speakers used the language, rather than just reading whatever English manual we had or listening to a teacher.”\nVoice 2  \nAlice Chen from Taiwan is a very successful test-taker. She won scholarship money for her TOEFL score. She gives simple but good advice to test-takers: “Take it easy… but be prepared!”\nVoice 1  \nWhat about you? Do you plan to take the TOEFL?

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Bruce Gulland.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Christy VanArragon. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nDo you know a child who likes to say, “No!”? As any parent knows, children sometimes refuse to do what a parent tells them to do. It can be very difficult for parents.\nVoice 2  \nSometimes, children march around angrily, lie on the ground, or even hit. This is not much fun for parents or children. But there is tool that can help. Sticker charts are one way to praise, punish and teach children. And they help parents stay calm and in control. Today’s Spotlight is on sticker charts.\nVoice 1  \nIt is difficult to raise children. Even well-behaved children can cause problems. Parents want their children to grow into healthy, strong adults. But it is difficult to know the best way to do this. Parents may try punishing, shaming, shouting or hitting. But these methods teach children to deal with their problems using violence. However, one method that has worked for many people is a sticker chart.\nVoice 2  \nA chart is any piece of paper with a series of squares. The squares are where parents will place the stickers. Stickers are pieces of paper that will attach, or stick, to other things. They come in many shapes and sizes. They can be shaped like animals, faces, stars, or something else the child enjoys. When a child does something good, the parent attaches a sticker to the square on the chart. And if a family cannot use stickers, they can write a special mark or picture in the chart. When the child has filled all the squares with stickers or marks, she receives a prize.\nVoice 1  \nHere is how you use the sticker chart. Imagine a child leaves his toys where they do not belong. His parents want him to clean up at the end of the day. They tell their son that every time he cleans up his toys, they will put a sticker on the chart. They ask him what a good prize would be for filling the chart. He says, “I want to help cook a meal!” Everyone agrees this is a good prize.\nVoice 2  \nThey put the chart where the child can see it. Their son still sometimes forgets to put away his things. So his parents simply do not award a sticker for that day. But their son wants more stickers so he begins to put away his things more often. And when he fills his chart, he gets to help cook a meal. It is a fun event the whole family can enjoy.\nVoice 1  \nBefore creating a sticker chart, Child Psychologist Erin N. King says there are a few things to remember.\nVoice 2  \nFirst, the goal should be stated positively. It is better to say, “John will keep his hands to himself.” than, “John will not hit other children.”\nVoice 1  \nSecond, think about how long the child must behave. It is difficult for a child to behave all day. If she makes a mistake in the morning, she will have no reason to behave for the rest of the day.\nVoice 2  \nFinally, only concentrate on one or two behaviours at one time. Children are still learning how to control themselves. Too many goals can be too much to remember.\nVoice 1  \nYou must also consider the age and ability of each child. If a sticker chart is too complex, the child will not be able to understand it.\nVoice 2  \nYou may also let the child create the sticker chart, and choose the goals and prizes. This will help the child feel involved. It will increase the chance that the sticker chart will work to change behaviour.\nVoice 1  \nSticker charts have several advantages for parents. They do not require parents to shout at, hit, or shame the child. Those methods teach children to solve problems with violence. When parents have a bad day, they may be less able to deal with children than on a good day. But sticker charts help stop parents from letting how they feel influence how they treat their children.\nVoice 2  \nAnd children like sticker charts too! Children need structure they can depend on. This makes them feel safe. Feeling safe is an important part of learning and growing. Sticker charts show children what parents expect of them. They also show progress. Children can see what they have done. They can follow along as they work toward a goal.\nVoice 1  \nSticker charts do not always work. Some children are too young. A good age to begin is around three years old. As children grow, both their goals and prizes need to grow too. A sticker chart will not work if the goals are too simple or the prizes too small.\nVoice 2  \nSticker charts also do not work unless parents also follow the rules. When a child does not earn a sticker, some parents will feel bad. They will still give her a sticker. This teaches her that her parents will give her what she wants even if she does not behave.\nVoice 1  \nAnd finally, some children just do not seem to care about sticker charts. This can be difficult for parents – especially when one child reacts well to sticker charts and another child does not.\nVoice 2  \nBut sticker charts are not a perfect tool, even if people use them correctly. Erica Reischer is a family Psychologist. She helps families to work through problems together. She argues that tools like sticker charts can be harmful to children. She says that children begin to expect awards for ALL good behaviour. They affect a child’s own personal desire to do good things. A child may be less likely to help or behave if they do not get a sticker for doing it.\nVoice 1\nSo how can parents know if using a sticker chart is good or bad for their children? Sticker charts can be a way for children to learn right behaviour. It is easy to try this method and think about how it is affecting your family. And it is important to remember that the relationship between parent and child is always more important than a tool like a sticker chart.\nVoice 2  \nDo you think a sticker chart would change how you act?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\n\nVoice 1  \nWhat does this sound like to you? Does it sound like a group of people arguing? Does it sound like a large family all talking at once? A party? Those are all good guesses! But this is the sound of a group of students in China. They are speaking English. Does it sound strange to you? This is how many people in China learn how to speak English. Today’s Spotlight is on a way of learning English called “Crazy English”.\nVoice 2  \nEnglish is the most popular language for business and international communication. Millions of people all over the world are learning English. This is especially true in China. Some people even call China’s interest in English “English Fever”. For more than 20 years people in China have been excited to study English.\nPhoto by Kit Sanchez\nVoice 1  \nBut for people in China, English is more than just another language. People see it as a tool to improve their lives. Many of these people believe that English can help them succeed in business. Others think it will help them find love. Some studies estimate that there are around 300 million people in China who are studying English.\nVoice 2  \nYears ago, Li Yang was one of these people studying English. Li Yang was born in the Northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang. His parents worked very hard at their jobs. They wanted Li to also work hard. If Li made a mistake on his school work, his mother would tear up the paper he was writing on.\nVoice 1  \nLi did not enjoy school very much. He did not enjoy studying. Li was also very quiet and shy. He did not like talking to people. When Li went to university, he had to take an English test. This was an important test that all students needed to take. So Li and his friend decided to read and speak outside every day. Li found that the louder he spoke, the better he felt. He said that he felt brave. Li believed that when he stopped shouting, he stopped learning.\nVoice 2  \nReading and speaking is not a new way to learn how to speak a new language. Li took this method and made it louder. He began speaking English everywhere he went. When his friends went to sleep, he went outside and spoke there.\nVoice 1  \nWhen it was time to take the English test, Li got second place. The other students were surprised. Li kept using this method of learning. And after some time, he began to sound like a native English speaker.\nPhoto by Green Chameleon\nVoice 2  \nWhen Li finished school he got a job as an electrical engineer. He also taught English classes in his free time. After a few years he decided to quit his job and start his own English teaching company. Li and his sister rented an office and slept on the floor. His sister helped to manage the business and Li taught the classes. The business was named “Crazy English.” Crazy is another word for “insane” or “wild”. Li called the method of teaching “Crazy English” because it was so different.\nVoice 1  \nLi worked very hard teaching English. After a short time, more people heard about Li and his teaching methods. People wrote to him asking for materials.\nVoice 2  \nOn one teaching trip, Li met Ouyang Weijian, the leader of an elementary school. Ouyang saw Li speak to a crowd of people. He was surprised by Li’s methods. Ouyang invited Li to teach an English class in his city. Li agreed. But Li did not know that so many people would attend. Five thousand people came to hear Li teach English. Li was very happy about the event.\nVoice 1  \nYears passed and the business grew. Ouyang joined Li Yang as the business manager. The crowds of people got larger and larger. People treated Li like a famous person. His method of teaching was very different.\nVoice 2  \nGoing to a Li Yang English class is like going to a music event. Li Yang stands on the stage and shouts. The crowd repeats what he says. Together, thousands of people practice English words. Each word has a physical movement. The crowd raises and moves their arms together while shouting. This is Crazy English.\nVoice 1  \nMost people in China, and other places in the world, learn English in small classrooms. They study from books. They learn the words. They memorize the rules of the English language. But they are afraid to make a mistake. So they do not speak English out loud. Li wanted to change this. He wanted to make people feel strong in speaking English.\nVoice 2  \nBut people do not always like Li’s methods. Some people say that methods like this do not follow Chinese culture. Or, they are just a quick idea to make money. But every person learns differently. Something that works for one person may not work for another.\nVoice 1  \nAnd this method seems to work for many of Li’s students. They enjoy Crazy English and believe that it is a good way to improve speaking English. Li has taught business groups. He has taught soldiers on top of the Great Wall of China. He helped many people improve their English to prepare for the 2008 Olympic events. In all these different places, Li tells his students one important lesson. He says they must “love losing face”. In a video for young adults, he said:\nVoice 3  \n“You have to make a lot of mistakes. You have to be laughed at by a lot of people. But that does not matter. Your future is totally different from other people’s futures.”\nVoice 2\nLi wants students to know that it is good to make mistakes. He wants them to enjoy making mistakes. Because he knows that if you are making mistakes, you are trying. And trying something is the first step to success.\nVoice 1  \nToday, the business of Crazy English is smaller than it was in the past. And Li has had some legal troubles. But the Crazy English method continues.\nVoice 2  \nWhat do you think about Li Yang’s Crazy English teaching method? Would shouting help you improve your English? Tell us how you practice English.

                "content": "Voice 1  \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2  \nAnd I’m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\n\nVoice 1  \nAlone in her room, a young girl sits down and begins reading a book. The book is a very famous one. It is called “Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry.” It tells the story of Cassie Logan and her family. They live in the United States in the 1930s. And they are African Americans. In those times, the state of Mississippi had a severe problem with racism. The government allowed people to make life difficult for African Americans, and people with darker skin colour. Often, groups of white men killed black men and women without punishment. It was a very frightening time.\nVoice 2  \nBut the young girl does not know this. She knows little about American history. She is growing up many years later, in the 1970s. The situation in the United States has improved. But reading the book helps the young girl understand Cassie Logan’s fear, and her other emotions. The girl reading is white. She lives in a very small town, where there are no black people. But the book helps her see what it is like to be different. When she finishes the book, she is crying. That night, she tells herself she will never judge another person by what they look like. The book has changed her life. Today’s Spotlight is on how reading can help people understand each other.\nVoice 1  \nThere is a name for the emotion the girl felt while reading the book. It is empathy. There are two different kinds of empathy. The first lets people sense other people’s emotions. It is what happens when we feel sad because another person is sad. Or it helps us understand that a person is angry, even when they will not say.\nVoice 2  \nThe second kind of empathy is called cognitive empathy. This is what happens when a person reads a book. Cognitive empathy happens when a person tries to identify and understand another person’s emotions. Some people even imagine that they are the other person. There is even an old English idiom for cognitive empathy: taking a walk in another person’s shoes. It means to imagine that you have lived their life.\nPhoto by Jose Pablo Garcia\nVoice 1  \nScientists do not yet know exactly what happens in a person’s brain when they feel empathy. It is a very complex process. But scientists have observed it happening. They believe empathy involves a brain cell called a mirror neuron. These cells work when we observe other people. Mirror neurons send messages through the brain. This is called “firing”. When these cells fire, they help us to identify emotions we see. But the same kind of cell also fires when we HAVE that emotion. So, when we are sad, a mirror cell will fire. But when we see someone who is sad, that same cell fires. We can understand an emotion. And through mirror neurons, we feel that emotion ourselves.\nVoice 2  \nEmpathy is very important in society. Without empathy we would not help each other. We would not care for each other. As a feeling, empathy makes us want to help. It makes us want the world to be a better place.\nVoice 1  \nBarack Obama is the former president of the United States. In 2006, he made a speech to the graduates of Northwestern University. He described how empathy influences how people act.\nVoice 3  \n“Think of a child who is hungry or the steel worker who no longer has a job. Or think of the family whose home was destroyed by a storm. When you have empathy, it does not matter if they are close friends or far-away strangers. It is difficult not to act. It is hard not to help.”\nVoice 2  \nMost people have empathetic feelings. But people can train themselves to be more empathetic. However, this takes work. Meeting people who are different than we are is one way to gain empathy. But distance often divides people. So it is difficult for people to understand each other when they never meet.\nVoice 1  \nReading may be a solution for this. The girl who read “Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry”, did not know any African Americans. But the book helped her understand the life of a person who was. Cassie Logan was not a real person. But her situation was real. And the girl understood Cassie’s feelings. From the book, the girl learned a little of what it was to be African American. She felt like she could understand.\nPhoto by Aarón Blanco Tejedor\nVoice 2  \nDavid Kidd is a psychologist. He studies the science of how people behave. Kidd works at the New School for Social Research in New York. In 2012, he helped show that reading increases empathy. In a test, he made people read different kinds of books. Some of these books were literary fiction, or complex invented stories. These stories made people think about the emotions of the characters in them. After reading these literary fiction books, the people were better able to understand what other people were thinking. And they could more easily identify emotions.\nVoice 1  \nKeith Oatley is another psychologist. He also studies how reading connects to empathy. He tells the Washington Post newspaper,\nVoice 4  \n“When we read about other people, we can imagine that we are in their position. We can imagine what it’s like being that person. That lets us better understand people and to work together better.”\nVoice 2  \nMany studies say that the effect of reading on empathy only works for complex fictional, or invented, stories. That is because this kind of writing concentrates on a character’s thoughts and feelings. This helps the reader to feel like they are inside the character’s head and thoughts. This produces the effect that leads to empathy.\nVoice 1  \nToday, many scientists believe that books are good tools for increasing empathy. But for readers, and many writers, this is not a new discovery. Together, they have made and explored new worlds and places. They have looked at how different people think and live. Stories have taken them places they may have never gone before.\nVoice 2  \nHave you ever read a book that changed you? How did it make you feel? Tell us about your experiences.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nA woman in the United States is making a meal. She chooses a recipe from a recipe book. She will follow this recipe, adding each different food at the right time to make a good-tasting meal. The recipe begins with common foods. First, she adds some juice from a sour lemon. Then she puts in some olive oil and a small amount of sweet honey. She adds some salt and pepper spice. Finally, she is ready to add the protein, or meat, into the meal. Does the recipe use chicken? Fish? Pork? No, the final ingredient in this recipe is katydids – a kind of insect!\nVoice 2 \nFor many people in the United States insects would be a very surprising ingredient. There, eating insects is not common. But this recipe book is trying to change the way people in the United States and other western countries think about eating insects. This book contains recipes for people to make food from insects. It is called the “Eat-A-Bug Cookbook.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this book is David George Gordon. In his book, he tells about the reasons that people should eat more insects. Eating insects is good for the environment, public health, and also the economy. Today’s Spotlight is on eating insects.\nVoice 2 \nExperts estimate that by 2050 there will be 9 billion people in the world. Almost a billion people already suffer from hunger every day. Our earth has a limited amount of resources like land and water. If we do not have enough food for the people on our earth now, how will we have enough for another 2 billion people in 2050?\nVoice 1 \nThese are the questions that experts around the world are struggling with. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a report in 2013. It explained:\nVoice 3 \n“The problem will be worse in the future. We need to think about what we eat and how we produce it. We need to find new ways of growing food.”\nVoice 2 \nThe report suggested that raising and eating insects was one way people could solve this problem. There are over 1,900 different kinds of insects that people can eat. The most common are beetles and caterpillars.\nVoice 1 \nMany people around the world already eat insects. In fact, insects are part of the traditional diet of over 2 billion people. For example, in China, some people cook insects over a fire. They put the insects on a stick. The cooked insects are served on the street as street food. They are also served in restaurants, where food costs a lot of money. In the country of Ghana, people collect the termite insect in the spring time. They grind the termites into a kind of powder similar to grain. They use the ground termites to make bread.\nVoice 2\nInsects are a part of traditional diets because they are a very healthy food. They contain almost as much protein as a serving of meat from a pig or cow. Protein is a substance all people need to eat to stay healthy. Insects are high in vitamins and minerals. And insects are also low in fat and cholesterol – substances that are necessary for the body, but only in small amounts.\nVoice 1 \nEating insects is also very good for the environment. Insects need fewer resources like land and water than larger animals. 90% of the fresh water people use goes to farming and raising animals.\nVoice 2 \nMarcel Dicke studies insects. In a TED talk, he explained how insects also produce more meat from the food they eat. For example, imagine a farmer. Imagine the farmer feeds a cow 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce about 1 pound of cow meat for people to eat. However, imagine the farmer gives cricket insects 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce 9 pounds of cricket meat for people to eat!\nVoice 1 \nEating more insects can also help people in poorer communities. Many people can raise and sell insects. Raising and selling insects can provide a job and food.\nVoice 2 \nBut insects will not replace livestock meat very quickly. First, people in some countries would have to change how they think about eating insects. Many people in North America and Europe eat a lot of livestock meat like cow and pigs. But they do not traditionally eat insects. They do eat some products of insects, like sweet honey from bees. But it is not normal to eat a whole insect in any form. In fact, for many people in the west, eating insects sounds insane! They believe insects are dirty and dangerous. Insects make people feel uncomfortable.\nVoice 1 \nSome people are trying to solve this problem. For example, we talked about David George Gordon’s recipe book at the beginning of this program. His recipe book tries to show people that eating insects can be delicious and easy. Other insect experts travel and tell people about the great effects of eating insects. But they still have a lot of work to do.\nVoice 2 \nAnother challenge is creating rules and laws for insect producers to follow. There should be rules about how to raise insects safely to eat as food. People also need to decide how to eat insects. Will they be whole? Will they be ground into powder like a grain? Or, will food scientists discover a way to take all of the great food substances from insects and serve them in a very different form? These are all questions that people will have to ask and answer in the near future.\nVoice 1 \nBut there are people who want to answer those questions now. José Andrés is a master chef in the United States. He has won important awards for his cooking. He serves insects in his restaurant. He believes that finding new forms of food is important for the future. He told the New Yorker Magazine:\nVoice 4 \n“We need to feed people in a sustainable way. In the future, the people who know how to produce protein will have an advantage over everyone else.”\nVoice 2 \nWill insects become the world’s main source of protein in the future?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA woman drives a black convertible over a hill. Her hair flows behind her out of this open-roofed vehicle. At the top of the hill, the road bends around sharp rocks. The sea crashes below. And, out above the sea, the sun begins to set. The woman parks her car and looks out over the ocean. The engine of her electric-powered car is quiet. Its sound disappears into the wind.\nVoice2\nCars are everywhere. They take people to remote places. They take people to work and to their homes. Usually, these automobiles are powered by gasoline or petrol. But things were not always this way, and they may not always be either.\nToday’s Spotlight is on the history and future of the automobile.\nVoice 1\nPeople have dreamed about creating cars for a very long time. They wanted a way to transport people and goods without animals. But it took a very long time to make one that worked.\nVoice2\nNicholas Cugnot was a French inventor. He built the first car in the late 1700’s. It used steam to power its engines. And it could drive at speeds of about 7 kilometres per hour. But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use. But cars did not become popular until someone invented a different kind of engine.\nVoice 1\nThe engine that powers many of the cars you see on the road today is called an internal combustion engine. Many people helped to create the internal combustion engine. But the first person to use it in a car was Karl Benz, in 1885. Internal combustion engines are smaller than steam engines. They use gasoline to fuel the engine. And they can produce more power to push a car faster.\nVoice2\nThis new engine made cars more popular around the world. But for a long time, only the very wealthy could buy them. Cars cost a lot of money because of the way people made them. One or two people made each car by hand. So cars took a long time to make. Also, each car was different so they cost a lot of money to fix.\nVoice 1\nBut in the early 1900s a man from the United States changed how cars were made. His name was Henry Ford.  Ford was a car engineer. At first, he made cars the traditional way. But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.\nVoice2\nFord’s method changed the way industry works around the world. He designed a system that made it easy to produce large amounts of his product. He paid his workers enough money so that they could buy his product. Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars. Many other car companies also used Ford’s methods. Cars began to cost less money all over the world.\nVoice 1\nBut the number of cars on the road also created a problem. Every car needed gasoline for fuel. Burning gasoline worked very well to power cars. But it also creates a lot of  pollution. The number of cars made some cities difficult to live in. People exposed to too much vehicle pollution develop problems with their breathing.\nVoice2\nBurning gasoline also creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that leads to global climate change. Using gasoline was a great idea when people started making cars. There were not many cars in the beginning, so the pollution did not affect much. But today there are more than one and a half billion cars on the road. The success of the car has turned gasoline use into a danger.\nVoice 1\nKate Brunton is a representative from Amber. Amber is a Dutch car company that makes electric, self-driving vehicles. She spoke to the University Network about the problem of gasoline cars.\nVoice 3\n“The problem is that owning cars, especially cars that use fuel, is bad. But there is no real choice. It is bad for consumers, because the cost of owning most cars is high. It is bad for the environment. It does not work well. Most cars spend 90 percent of their time standing still.”\nVoice2\nToday many car companies are working to make cars that do not need gasoline. For example, many large vehicle manufacturers have begun to produce electric vehicles. Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!\nVoice 1\nAnother newer creation is the hybrid vehicle. Hybrid cars use technology from both gasoline and electric engines. Hybrids have gasoline engines like normal cars. But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines. And they require less gasoline to operate.\nVoice2\nOther companies have been experimenting with different fuels. For example, it is possible to fuel a car with hydrogen. Many large car companies are researching this new technology. Right now, it is difficult to use hydrogen because it does not last very long. One tank full of hydrogen may only be able to fuel a car for a very short time. But people are hopeful that new technologies will help make hydrogen work in the future.\nVoice 1\nThere are many possible paths for the future of the car. How we travel has changed many times over the past hundred years. And it will change again. It may be possible that there will be no single replacement for the internal combustion engine. In the future, there may be many different kinds of cars, each with different fuels. Or people may use cars less.  Either way, it is important to continue to invest in these new technologies. It is important not only for the future of the car, but for the future of humanity.\nVoice2\nDo you own a car? What kind of engine does it have? Do you use busses or trains more often?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThe year was 1707. The English ships were in heavy seas. The Weather was bad, and they were lost. The chief of the ships was Admiral Shovell. His officers made an estimate of the ships’ position. But they were wrong. Suddenly, someone shouted ‘Land!’ This call filled the sailors with fear. There should be no land here. They were in the wrong place. Four of the ships crashed into the land. Over 1,600 men died that night. Only 26 survived. It was one of the worst British sea accidents in history. Today’s Spotlight is on one unexpected result of this accident.\nVoice2\nAt the time of the accident, England depended on the shipping industry. Ships brought the people of England sugar, spices, and tea. The people who sailed the ships needed good maps.\nVoice 1\nBut they also needed something more.  They needed to avoid accidents like the loss of Admiral Shovell’s ships. To do this they needed to know exactly where they were. If you look at almost any map, it is divided into small squares by lines.  The lines that go from east to west are the latitude lines. And the lines that go from north to south are the longitude lines. Sailors could estimate their north-south position, or latitude, easily. They could measure it from the sun and the stars. But they could not measure their east-west position, or longitude, by that method. They needed a good way to measure the ship’s ‘longitude’.\nVoice2\nKing Charles the Second of England knew how important it was to solve this problem.  If the problem was not solved, more ships could be lost. In 1675, King Charles ordered the building of the Royal Observatory. The Observatory was a place where people could study the stars. They could work on the problem of establishing longitude at sea. The King created the Observatory in Greenwich.\nThe first chief of the Observatory was John Flamsteed. Falmsteed worked hard, but he could not solve the longitude problem. And after the loss of Admirals Shovell’s ships, there was even more pressure to find a solution. So in 1714 the British Government offered a prize of GBP 20,0009. The prize would go to the first person who could find a method of measuring longitude at sea. Some people thought that this would never by possible.\nVoice 1\nOur story moves on, to one man – John Harrison. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1693. He was 21 years old when the government offered the prize. Like his father, he was a carpenter. He made things with wood. He did not have much education. But John was very good at making clocks. At that time, all clocks were made from wood. But John made many improvements to the clock design. His clocks did not break, like other clocks. And his clocks were very accurate. Each month they lost or gained no more than one second. They were more accurate than many of the best clocks in London. Three of these clocks still exist. And they are still very accurate!\nVoice2\nHarrison wanted to win the longitude prize of GBP 20,000. There was one simple way to estimate longitude. There are 24 longitude lines. At each line, the time changes by one hour. The simple solution was time! Sailors needed to know the exact time in two places. First, they needed to know the time in their own location. Sailors could use the position of the sun and the stars to tell the time where they were. But the sailors also needed to know the time at the place where the ship had started its voyage. The difference between the two would tell them their distance from that location If they knew that, they could work out the east-west position on the earth’s surface.\nVoice 1\nThe problem was that clocks at that time were not very accurate. They became less accurate when the air temperature changed. Movement could also affect a clock’s accuracy. So could water. All of these caused problems for clocks on ships! But Harrison knew that he could make a clock that would keep time during a sea voyage. Such a clock is called a chronometer.\nVoice2\nIt took Harrison five years to make his first chronometer. It performed well, but he continued to make changes to improve his designs. Some of these developments are still used in clocks and machines today.\nVoice 1\nHarrison’s fourth chronometer was very different from the other three. It was much smaller. It looked like a large watch. Harrison’s son William took the new improved chronometer with him on two trips to the West Indies. On both of these long sea trips the watch kept time very well – well enough for Harrison to win the prize.\nVoice2\nHowever, a group of experts would decide who should get the prize. The group was the Board of Longitude And the Board was not satisfied with Harrison’s clocks. Harrison was a carpenter. He had no education. The group wanted to make sure that Harrison had really made the watch. And they wanted to test it more, to make sure that it really worked. They asked Harrison to tell them how he had made it. At first Harrison was not willing to give away his secret. But in 1765, six experts visited Harrison and examined the watch. The Board gave Harrison only half of the prize money.\nVoice 1\nHarrison was now almost 80 years old. The Board still refused to pay him the rest of the prize money. So Harrison decided to appeal to the King, George III. The King tested the watch himself. He found it to be ery good. The King soon agreed that John and William Harrison had been unfairly treated. But the Board of Longitude still refused to pay the money.\nVoice2\nSo in April 1773, John and William Harrison appealed to the British government. And the appeal was successful. John Harrison received almost all his money. But it was the government, not the Board, who gave it to him. John Harrison died on the 23rd of March 1776. He had solved the longitude problem, for ships to find their east-west position. And he was finally recognized for his work.\nVoice 1\nThe writers of today’s programme were Shelagh Godwin and Mike Procter.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.\nVoice 2\nIf you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.\nVoice 1\nBees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.\nVoice 2\nBees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.\nVoice 1\nBut to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!\nVoice 2\nIt takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.\nVoice 1\nThe day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.\nVoice 2\nWhen the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:\nVoice 3\n“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”\nVoice 1\nThe hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.\nVoice 2\nBut this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation is a local organization in Southern India. It has worked with the honey hunters for fifteen years. They aim to protect the environment and local culture. Robert Leo works for the Keystone Foundation. He tells the organization Slow Food International:\nVoice 4\n“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”\nVoice 2\nMany young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam.

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.  \nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nOne hundred years ago. The night was dark. The sea was rough. The waves were high. And the wind was strong. The sailor was worried. He had sailed a long way. And he knew that he was close to land and dangerous rocks. If he sailed too close to the rocks, they would wreck his boat. He could drown.\nVoice 2\nBut then he saw it! He saw something that would keep him and his boat safe. He saw a bright light in the distance. The light was shining on and then off. He stopped worrying. It was a lighthouse. This tall building, a tower with a bright light at its top, would guide him. It warned those at sea to keep away from the rocks around it. With its light, the sailor knew where to sail to keep safe. Lighthouses like this have been guides for sailors for hundreds of years. But what is their future? Today’s Spotlight is on lighthouses.\nVoice 1\nImagine a world without GPS or computers. How would you know where you are in the dark? Sailors depended on lighthouses for many hundreds of years. They were built on the coast, on islands, rocks, and even the sea floor. Lighthouses guided sailors. The lights showed sailors where to sail and where not to sail. But lighthouses also helped sailors to identify where they were. Each lighthouse was different. Each had its own colours and marks. And each lighthouse had its own system or pattern of light flashes. So sailors knew where they were just by looking at the lighthouse both in the day and at night.\nVoice 2\nBefore lighthouses existed, fires on top of hills sometimes guided sailors. Later, people built towers to make the fires more noticeable. The first known lighthouse was the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt. It was built over 2000 years ago. For many centuries, this lighthouse was one of the tallest buildings in the world. It was about 106 meters tall.\nVoice 1\nThat ancient lighthouse no longer exists. But some other ancient lighthouses do. The Tower of Hercules in north-west Spain, is one such lighthouse. It was built by the Romans during the first or second century. This lighthouse is the oldest working lighthouse in the world. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nVoice 2\nExperts say that the age of modern lighthouses began in the 18th century. In this period engineers improved the way that lighthouses were lit. Some lighthouses used coal fires to create the important light. Others still used wood fires. And some used oil lights or even wax candles. But all these forms of light produced smoke. And the smoke made the glass of the lighthouse black and dirty. When the glass was dirty, sailors could not see the light.\nVoice 1\nBut in 1782 a Swiss scientist solved the problem. He invented a method of burning oil that did not produce smoke. Other engineers produced equipment to increase the intensity or power of the light.\nVoice 2\nOver the years, lighthouses used different methods of shining a light out into the sea. But in every case, someone needed to look after the light in the lighthouse. Someone had to light it at night. Someone had to keep the equipment working. So, lighthouse keepers were needed. George Medlicott was a lighthouse keeper in the United Kingdom for 32 years. He told the Independent about his memories of living and working in a lighthouse.\nVoice 3\n‘It was not an easy job. Some of the lighthouses did not have running water, working toilets or heating. Winters were not great. We stayed in small rooms and often spent hours in the dark.’\nVoice 1\nOften a lighthouse keeper had to live away from his family. But sometimes his family stayed with him. Ebonee Gregory had an unusual time as a child. Her father was an assistant lighthouse keeper. She lived with him on a lonely island off the coast of Australia. She told the Guardian about his job and how it affected her.\nVoice 4\n‘My father helped the head lighthouse keeper run and care for the lighthouse and island. They took turns to turn the light on every night and off in the morning. They cleaned the glass. They made weather reports. Our food arrived by air every two weeks along with any letters. If there was bad weather, the food drops would be delayed. I did not have any friends. A picture of my second birthday party shows no one my age, just the two families on the island.’\nVoice 2\nBut times have changed for lighthouses. New technology for lighthouses and navigation has arrived. Soon there may be no lighthouse keepers living in lighthouses. Many countries including Australia, Finland, Ireland, and Japan no longer employ lighthouse keepers.\nVoice 1\nPunta Carena is an important lighthouse on the edge of the island of Capri in Italy. Lighthouse keepers worked there for over 151 years. But now its last lighthouse keeper has left. Carlo D’Oriano was the last lighthouse keeper of Punta Carena. He did not want to leave. He felt that it was important to have a person in a lighthouse in case anything went wrong with the technology. As he prepared to leave his lighthouse home and job he talked with the BBC. He remembered storm waves crashing into his window 25 metres up the lighthouse. He remembered storm winds that made the lighthouse shake.\nVoice5\n‘At first I believed these shakes were small earthquakes or shocks. But over the years I have learned that the anger of the sea is more beautiful than a quiet sea. It makes you remember that nature exists and that this mass of water is open and alive. Only someone who lives alone can understand this. My heart is here. When I can no longer keep the light, I think part of me will turn off too.”\nVoice 2\nWhat do you think is lost when lighthouse keepers have to leave? Do you think technology can do a better job guiding boats at night? Do we even need lighthouses anymore? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nImagine the inside of a laboratory. Men and women in white lab coats bend over long tables. One woman is working over a small plastic dish. She takes a small container of liquid and empties it into the dish. Then, she squeezes several drops of a different liquid from a long tube. She seals the dish, and places it in a container with several more dishes.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nSix weeks pass. The dishes sit in their container. But inside the dishes, something is happening. Slowly, a red substance starts to grow. By the end of the six weeks, it fills the dish. It looks like a hamburger! But does it taste like one? The woman returns to the laboratory and chooses one dish. She brings it into a kitchen and places the substance on a hot pan. Once it is brown, she puts it between two pieces of bread. Then, she takes a big bite!\nVoice 1\nThis may seem like something from a futuristic film. But the woman has just taken her first bite of lab-grown, or in vitro, meat. Many people think this new technology can help solve many problems in the world of meat production. But will people really eat it? Today’s Spotlight is on in vitro meat.\nVoice 2\nMany people around the world love meat. People eat pigs, chicken, cows, goats, and many other animals. Meat is an important part of the world’s diet. For some, meals with meat are important to who they are. Many regional foods depend on meat for their uniqueness.\nVoice 1\nBut there is also a big problem with meat. Raising animals takes up a lot of space, food, and water. And the global population is increasing. As more people come to live on the earth, they will demand more meat. But the earth may not have enough space to keep these animals. \nVoice 2\nRaising livestock animals also has a serious effect on climate change. Some animals, like cows, goats, and sheep, have special stomachs. These stomachs allow them to eat foods that are very hard to digest, like grasses and leaves. But digesting these foods produces a lot of methane gas. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. It traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide. And the global meat industry is responsible for 30 percent of the world’s methane production! If the world continues to produce meat like this, it could be very bad for the environment.\nVoice 1\nFor some people, growing meat in laboratories may be the solution to this problem. Meat grown with this method is usually called cultured meat, lab-grown meat, or in vitro meat. To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.\nVoice 3\n“Cultured meat could address all the problems related to industrial meat production. It addresses environmental impacts and concerns about treating animals well. It stops the risks of getting diseases from animals. It can do all this while making sure there is a production system to meet the growth in demand for animal protein.”\nVoice 2\nFor people like Specht, in vitro meat could solve many of our problems. But the technology for in vitro meat is still very new. And it is still very expensive. Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce. But a meal of this chicken will cost about 17 dollars.\nVoice 1\nThe process also may not be as environmentally friendly as people thought. Growing in vitro meat uses a lot of energy. Some of this energy will come from burning fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. And it lasts in the atmosphere longer than methane. So, many people say it is worse for the planet in the long-term.\nVoice 2\nGrowing in vitro meat may also cause a lot of waste. This is because cell cultures must be sterile. They must be free of any bacteria. Otherwise, other things will grow, and ruin the meat. These sterile containers also create a lot of plastic waste. And there is already a problem of too much plastic waste in the environment. \nVoice 1\nBut the biggest question about in vitro meat might be: will people eat it? Many people do not trust food grown in a lab. In vitro meat may seem unnatural. Or people might fear that it will somehow affect their bodies in a bad way. And in vitro meat also does not taste like meat from animals. It does not have fat, only muscle. Fat must be added later, and the taste is still not quite the same.\nVoice 2\nStill, in vitro meat is coming. Today, it is available in very few places. But dozens of companies are working on their meat growing methods. Companies have invested billions of dollars in this research. And many people believe that it is the protein of the future. Josh Tetrick is the CEO of Eat Just, which grows in vitro chicken. He told the website CNET.\nVoice 4\n“I want tens of thousands of restaurants to have cultured meat on their menu. Then, at some point, I want them to ask their chefs, ‘why do we have conventional chicken on the menu, too?’”\nVoice 1\nWould you eat in vitro meat? Why, or why not?

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA city sits on the edge of the North Sea. It is very old . Some of buildings show this age. But many are surprisingly modern. High glass structures mix with ancient churches. And many canals run between these buildings. The Rhine River flows through the center of the city. The city is beautiful. It is like nowhere else in the world.\nVoice 2\nThis city is called Rotterdam. It is the largest city in the country of the Netherlands. And this city has a rich history that goes back over eight hundred years. But Rotterdam also has a problem: it is sinking. In fact, much of the Netherlands is sinking. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on this sinking country.\nVoice 1\nThe Netherlands has a long history of working with water. Over one third of the country is below sea level. In 800 B.C., much of the land was not land at all. It was under water! But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.\nVoice 2\nOver the years, the Dutch have developed many ways of keeping water out of the land. They built huge walls across lakes and the sea coast. These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.\nVoice 1\nWorking with water is very important to the Netherland’s success. It helped the country to grow. It is still a very small country. But today it is the seventeenth largest economy in the world!\nVoice 2\nBut removing water often has a downside. Much of the Netherlands is built on peat, a special kind of thick decaying plant material. Usually, peat rests on top of water. When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!\nVoice 1\nFor the people of Rotterdam, this is a very big problem. Many buildings there are very old. Some were built hundreds of years ago. They do not have good foundations. When the ground subsides, those foundations can break. If people do not do something, the buildings may fall over.\nVoice 2\nBut there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.\nVoice 1\nBut the people of the Netherlands are not giving up. Instead, they are making plans for the future. Some believe that the old methods will still work. The Dutch could continue to build dikes and pump water. But as sea levels rise, the cost of this method will go up as well.\nVoice 2\nInstead, the Dutch are doing something different. They are not completely keeping the water out. They are letting some in. They call this the “Room for the River” program. In this program, the Dutch ask people to leave some low areas near rivers. Or, they repurpose public places. If there is a flood, these areas will fill first. They will keep water out of larger cities and towns. Hans Docter is a Dutch ambassador. He spoke to Haaretz news service about the effort.\nVoice 3\n“That’s the idea of living with the sea. Living with the water. In the past, we tried to keep the water out as much as we could. Now, we join it much more to our living areas.”\nVoice 1\nThe Room for the Rivers project is part of a larger movement in the Netherlands. Subsidence and climate change are already happening. The country will get lower. And water levels will rise. It will be impossible to stop the water completely. So, the Dutch are changing their lives. They are trying to live with the new situation.\nVoice 2\nIn some places, these changes have already begun. Stan Fleerakkers is a farmer from the Netherlands. The government bought his farm as part of the room for the river project. But Fleerakkers did not want to move. So, the government built a large terp in the area. Fleerakkers moved his farm onto the terp. Now, when the area floods, there is water in his old farmland. But he is living high above it.\nVoice 1\nMany more people may soon live like Fleerakkers. The Dutch may build the land up instead of keeping the water out. Or, they may make their homes with new building standards. Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood. But the flood will not harm anyone. In Rotterdam, buildings are already made to hold or be above water.\nVoice 2\nThese efforts are very expensive. But in the Netherlands, it may be worth it. Fleerakkers spoke to the magazine Politico:\nVoice 4\n“It is not as expensive as when a village is flooded. We spend a lot of money in Holland on water management. We have to do it. If we do not, we will be flooded. There will be no factories. No people will live here. It will all be gone.”\nVoice 1\nMany other countries will soon need to think about these solutions themselves. As climate change gets worse, many other cities will be in danger of flooding. Cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and New Orleans are already dealing with the problem. No country can solve climate change by themselves. Everyone must work together to handle the issue. But many countries may look to the Netherlands as an example. They have a long history of dealing with water. That history may be just what the future needs.\nVoice 2\nDo you live in a place threatened by climate change?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Mike Procter. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Ruby still sleeps in the basket. She sleeps with her soft plaything. She likes to have both hands and feet holding something when she is lifted. Do you want to hold her?”\nVoice 1\nDiedre de Villiers is talking about a baby. But Ruby is not a human baby. She is a small furry animal – a koala. De Villiers is a koala researcher. She is caring for Ruby. De Villiers rescued Ruby from the mouth of a dog. And Ruby is sick. De Villiers will care for her until she is healthy. Then Ruby will be able to live in the trees with other wild koalas. Today’s Spotlight is on these koalas.\nVoice 2\nPeople often call koalas “koala bears.” A koala does look like a small size bear. Like a bear, it is covered with grey hair or fur. It has large ears, wide eyes and a long black nose. A koala has a round furry body like a bear. But a koala is not a bear – it is a marsupial.\nVoice 1\nMarsupials are animals that have a special way to carry their newborn babies. They have a pouch. The fur on their stomach can open to hold something – a bit like a bag. The koala mother carries her new baby in this pouch. This makes it easier for her to climb trees. Koalas spend most of their lives up in a tree. They eat tree leaves. Koalas particularly like the shiny, dark leaves of the eucalyptus tree.\nVoice 2\nEucalyptus trees grow in Eastern Australia. This is the home of the koalas too. Around the year 1800, Europeans settled in Australia. At this time, there were probably millions of koalas in Eastern Australia. The number is much smaller now. The Australian Koala Foundation says there are only about forty to eighty thousand koalas left. This sounds like a big number. However, koalas are in serious danger.\nVoice 1\nThe human population of Australia is growing. As people build more roads and houses, they cut down eucalyptus trees. But the koalas need these trees to survive. Trees provide shelter, food and safety for the koalas. Humans also build fences, drive vehicles and own dogs. These things can all be dangerous to a koala. Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles. They are even dying from simple things – like a person who cuts down several eucalyptus trees around his house.”\nVoice 2\nPeople also bring something else that harms koalas – disease. Koalas can die from human disease. It causes another problem too. Disease can change their behaviour. It can make koalas fight each other. Diseases can also make koalas unable to produce babies. This is a big problem because the number of koalas is shrinking. Many people are worried that soon there may be no koalas at all.\nVoice 1\nJoel Sartore is a photographer for National Geographic Magazine. He is very famous for his pictures of rare or endangered animals. He visited Eastern Australia to take pictures of koalas. Sartore took one particularly difficult picture. It was a picture of all the koalas that had died in one area during one week. The picture shows the bodies of thirteen koalas. Sartore tells National Geographic about it:\nVoice 4\n“I knew I had to get a picture of dead koalas for this story. But I kept having trouble. People at the animal clinic I was working with said it would look bad. The Australian government does not even like to say that these koalas are endangered. But the workers at one place I visited thought this was an important picture to make. They told me that in this area these animals will be completely gone in three to five years. They want the world to know that.”\nVoice 2\nThe koala has many enemies such as disease, dogs and people cutting down trees. But koalas have many friends too. Many people are working to protect the koalas from danger. People like Deidre de Villiers take care of hurt koalas. Some people even work with koalas in their own houses.\nVoice 1\nSamantha Longman is one of these people. She takes care of koala babies. She is like their mother! The baby koalas climb on her. They depend on her. She tells National Geographic about this work:\nVoice 5\n“It does not leave me much time for anything else! But the little creatures are part of our family. What we are doing is important.”\nVoice 2\nSome people work with the government to protect land and trees. The Australian Koala Foundation, or AKF, is asking the government to use more land as natural park areas. These parks would be a good place for koalas to live. The AKF would also like the government to create laws to protect koalas. They want to stop people from cutting down eucalyptus trees. Without eucalyptus trees, the koalas can not survive. The AKF website explains:\nVoice 6\n“Eighty percent of the land that koalas live on is on privately owned. It is often farmland – not in national parks. This is why the AKF wants a law that will prevent people from cutting down trees on their land. We want a law to encourage people to protect and manage the land where koalas live.”\nVoice 1\nThere is another way de Villiers works to protect koalas. She watches wild koalas. This way she can learn how the koalas are doing. She studies their health. And she studies the population growth of koalas in the area.\nVoice 2\nHumans have caused many problems for koalas in Australia. But de Villiers says that people and koalas can live together. People can make some changes that would help the koalas. They can drive more slowly. They can make sure that there are enough eucalyptus trees for the koalas to live in and eat.\nVoice 1\nOn one trip de Villiers studied Tee Vee – a koala she had watched for over a year.  To her surprise, de Villiers discovered Tee Vee had a young baby in her pouch. De Villiers shared her excited reaction with National Geographic:\nVoice 3\n“While there are still healthy babies, there is still hope.”\nVoice 2\nThe voices you heard were from the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Lots of people say – how can you work out in the wild when you are a woman? But I can do anything I want.  Many other people, especially young women like us, they want to join us. I am a woman. I am going to have a baby. I want my baby to see a rhino. That is why I am protecting it.”\nVoice 1\nLeitah Michabela said this to The Guardian newspaper. Michabela is part of a group in South Africa called The Back Mambas. They work to protect wild animals, particularly one special animal – the rhinoceros, or rhino. Today’s Spotight is on The Black Mambas of South Africa.\nVoice 2\nSouth Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.\nVoice 1\nRhinos are protected by the laws of the country. But people still hunt them. Some people think that the rhino horn has special powers. They will pay a lot of money for it. Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.\nVoice 2\nIn Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.\nVoice 1\nBut even with punishments and armed rangers, the rate of rhino deaths in Kruger Park was still very high. Authorities needed another solution to save the rhinos. So they formed a new group in a nearby area called Balule Nature Reserve. This group has reduced trapping and poaching in their area by 76 percent!\nVoice 2\nThis new force is made up only of women. They are named the Black Mambas after a deadly kind of snake. The Black Mambas do not carry guns. Instead they concentrate on protecting the animals and natural environment in the Park. Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Black Mambas. She explains to The Guardian why her group is so important.\nVoice 4\n“There were men rangers carrying guns. But still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached.\nI think they said, ‘Let us start something and add women and see what happens.’ Women are more loyal to their jobs. So they feel very strongly about what they do.”  \nVoice 1\nIn 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.\nVoice 2\nSince 2013, the Mambas have patrolled the metal fence which marks the Park area. They watch for poachers. They remove traps, or snares, set by poachers. And they report everything they see. The Mambas also go into the community. There, they educate people, especially children, about protecting animals.\nVoice 1\nAnd the women of the Black Mambas have made a big difference. The Guardian says in the six months before they began, 16 rhinos were killed in Balule. In the year after the Black Mambas started, only three rhinos were killed. Siphiwe Sithole says:\nVoice 4\n“The Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching. We have zero acceptance of rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”\nVoice 2\nPeople all over the world have noticed the Black Mambas’ success. The New York Times published pictures of them. They won an award from the UK organization Helping Rhinos. And the UN gave them the Champions of the Earth prize in 2015 for their courage. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Achim Steiner said:\nVoice 5\n“Their many successes are a result of their great courage and strong desire to make a difference in their community. The Black Mambas are an inspiration, not only locally, but across the world to all those working to stop the ugliness of the illegal wildlife trade.”\nVoice 1\nWinning awards like this shows people that it is possible to prevent poaching. It also shows local people that the Black Mambas are valuable. Mamba Felicia Mogakane explains:\nVoice 6\n“It is about knowing that people in South Africa love and are thankful fo what we are doing. They are so happy that there are Mambas. Some years ago, they used to say this job is for men. Now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job. Jobs are limited in South Africa. So this is a big chance for me because I am able to take care of my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe Black Mambas are doing important work to save rhinos. But they are also doing important work in their communities. They are supporting their families by earning money. And people respect and honour them because of the work that they do. The Black Mambas show that communities and nature can work together. They bring hope for both people and animals in South Africa. We close our program today with the words of another Mamba, Collette Ngobeni, who share her hope for the future:\nVoice 7\n“If we work together as a community, we can solve this problem. People need to open their minds and their hearts. It is not about money. It is about our culture, our future.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThis program may be difficult for some people to hear. This program is about the death of a child.\nVoice 2\nImagine a woman meeting her seven-year-old child. She has not seen the girl in a very long time. So, when they do see each other, the girl asks where her mother has been. She says she has missed her mother. The woman bursts into tears. But the girl does not seem angry. Together, they walk to a playground. The woman, still crying, watches her child play.\nVoice 1\nAfter a time, the girl takes her mother’s hand. Together, they fly up to a place that is a little like heaven. This is where the girl lives now. Together, they eat some of the girl’s favourite foods. Then, the girl is tired. She lies down in her bed. She tells her mother she loves her. “I am not in pain anymore,” she says. Then, she and the bed disappear for the last time. The woman cries and cries.\nVoice 2\nThis woman’s name is Jang Ji-Sung, and she is not really meeting with her daughter. Instead, she is in a virtual reality simulation. Her daughter died of blood cancer. She has been dead for three years. But virtual reality programmers have attempted to re-create what the child looked like. They talked to her parents to understand what she was like. They asked about her favourite things. Then, they made a program that was just like her. They showed it to her mother. It was a program designed to help Jang process her grief.\nVoice 1\nPeople struggle with how to deal with death. Losing someone can feel like losing a part of yourself. And many of us want to have those people back. We may not know how to deal with these feelings. So, we tell stories about them. We look at pictures of them. And we try to get through the pain. But technology is becoming more advanced. And people are wondering if this advanced technology can change the way that we grieve. But are these technologies good? And are they the best way to deal with death? Today’s Spotlight is on how technology can change our ways of grieving.\nVoice 2\nStories about rescuing people from the dead are part of a long tradition of storytelling. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is from ancient Greece. They teach us lessons about seeing our loved ones after they have already died. Megan tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.\nVoice 1\nOrpheus was a famous poet and musician. And Eurydice was his wife. They loved each other very much. Orpheus made music about her so beautiful that it made gods cry. But one day, Eurydice stepped on a poisonous snake. It bit her, and she died. Orpheus was incredibly sad.\nHe was so troubled that he travelled to Hades. In Greek myth, Hades was the land of the dead. He convinced its ruler to free Eurydice. Orpheus could lead Eurydice back to the land of the living. But there was one problem. Orpheus could not look at Eurydice. If he did, Eurydice would remain in Hades.\nBut Orpheus could not help himself. He was almost to the surface. And he glanced around at Eurydice. In that moment, she disappeared. He would never see her again. His grief was greater than when she first died. He had some hope. Now he had none.\nVoice 2\nThis story is a warning about thinking too much about the past. The point of the story is that the dead are dead. Wishing they are not dead will only hurt you. It will stop you from living your life.\nVoice 1\nModern stories show a different way of dealing with grief. They talk about how technology can affect the grieving process. Black Mirror is a British science-fiction television show. Each episode tells a different story. And each deals with our relationship to technology. One episode is called “Be Right Back.” Bruce tells the story from this episode.\nVoice 2\nA woman’s boyfriend dies in a car crash. But she discovers that there is a new technology. This technology can look at her boyfriend’s social media. It can use this information to create an artificial intelligence. It is like her boyfriend. There is even technology to re-create a life-like copy of his body. She uses this technology. But the copy is not quite the same. It does not have her boyfriend’s negative qualities. It will do what she asks without question. She grows to hate the copy. It will never actually be her boyfriend.\nVoice 1\nThis story is also a warning. It warns that technology can never replace humans. And that trying to bring people back will result only in pain.\nVoice 2\nBut are all technologies like this? Nick Stavrou and Steve Koutsouliotas are game designers. In 2015, they started creating a program called Project Elysium. Project Elysium was a virtual reality program. In it, people could visit virtual images of their dead loved ones. They could sit with them. They might even play a game together. These virtual images would not be very realistic. They would not be able to talk. But they would look, and act, in similar ways. They would be like photographs that moved and smiled. Koutsouliotas spoke to Fast Company magazine. He talked about why he thinks Project Elysium could be a good thing. He said,\nVoice 3\n“What if you never had a chance to say goodbye? What if you feel like you are forgetting that person? Sometimes, I panic. I feel like I am forgetting what my father’s face looked like. It is the small things that I fear losing as time goes on. Like sitting next to him. Or, watching him smile when I told him something funny. These are the things that Project Elysium has a better chance at offering.”\nVoice 1\nStavrou and Koutsouliotas believe that technology can help the grieving process. Visiting someone in project Elysium would be just like looking at a picture. Or it could be like going to a memorial.\nVoice 2\nStill, there are concerns about this kind of technology. As it grows more advanced, could it become more like Black Mirror? Technology may one day be able to make a realistic virtual copy of someone. But someone who is living could also become a virtual copy, even if it is something they did not choose. And it could make grief worse.\nVoice 1\nBut grief is different for everyone. For some people, seeing someone they loved in virtual reality will make them feel worse. For others, it may do a lot of good. For Jang Ji-sung, seeing her daughter again was difficult. But it helped her do something she felt she had not been able to do. She could say goodbye. She spoke in a documentary made about her experience. She said,\nVoice 4\n“Maybe it is a real paradise. I met my daughter. She called me with a smile. It was a very short time. But it is a very happy time. I think I have had the dream I have always wanted.”\nVoice 2\nHave you lost a loved one?

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIt is 2015. A rocket ship stands upright in a large field. The technicians inside have made sure it is safe. And now, a yellow flame begins to glow underneath the rocket. The ship rises from the ground.\nVoice 2\nInside, the astronauts prepare themselves for a difficult ride. The speed of the rocket is pushing them back against their chairs, so that they cannot move. Even the skin on their faces gets pushed back. But soon, the ship passes through the earth’s atmosphere and finally into space. There is less gravity here. So, the astronauts begin to float off their seats. Only their seatbelts hold them back.\nVoice 1\nOne of these astronauts is named Scott Kelly. Soon, he and the others will arrive at the international space station, or ISS. They are bringing supplies. And they will help run the station. But Kelly’s trip is special. Many of the others will be at the station a few months. But Kelly will be in space for an entire year. Today’s Spotlight is on Scott Kelly’s year in space and what that might mean for future space travel.\nVoice 2\nToday, many people have been to space. Some have even lived there longer than Scott Kelly. Valeri Polyakov was a Russian Cosmonaut. He stayed at the ISS for almost 14 months! But still, scientists do not know much about what happens to a person’s body when they go to space. This is why Scott Kelly is so important. He is an identical twin.\nVoice 1\nScott Kelly has a brother named Mark Kelly. They look almost exactly alike – they are identical. But, most importantly, they have the same genes. Scientists examined the twins before Scott went to space. When he was in space, Scott sent the scientists genetic samples. And, when he came back, they examined both twins again. They could then compare the results. They could compare, scientifically, what space did to Scott’s body.\nVoice 2\nSpace is a very different environment than Earth. And human bodies are not very used to it. Most of this has to do with the lack of gravity. Living without gravity would be very strange for most of us. For example, you cannot drink from a cup in space. Water will not stay inside. Water floats in a ball in the open. Instead, you must drink from a pouch, or a straw. Using the toilet can also be a messy business. People on the ISS have special machines to capture their waste. Otherwise, it would float around, and contaminate the environment.\nVoice 1\nBut living in space means more than just changing your environment. It actually changes a person’s body. When Scott Kelly entered the ISS, there was no gravity pushing down his spine. So, his spine got longer. In space, he was about three centimetres taller than on earth. He also did not have to use his muscles much. In space, you can float in one direction just by lightly kicking a wall. Or you can guide yourself with your hands. This sounds very fun. But it also means muscles atrophy and lose their power to move. If a person were to go from space to earth, it would be very difficult for them to move. So, people living in space must exercise a lot. This also keeps their bones strong and healthy.\nVoice 2\nBut other changes happened to Scott Kelly that no one had seen before. The way his genes worked changed. People’s genes do not change. But a person’s environment can change what those genes do. Scientists call this gene expression. If a person is in a very stressful environment, different genes will express themselves. Scott Kelly was in a very strange environment. So his genes started expressing themselves differently. Christopher Mason is a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine. He also helped study Scott and Mark. He spoke about the study at a conference.\nVoice 3\n“As soon as Scott got into space there was a huge change in over 1000 genes that are changing a lot. So clearly the body and cells were adapting to this new environment of space.”\nVoice 1\nFew of these changes hurt Scott Kelly. Some even made his immune system stronger. But being in space for a year did have some negative effects. The shape of his eyes changed. His vision got worse. His blood vessels became swollen. He got greater risk of heart disease. Scott also encountered some radiation in space. This means he has a higher risk for cancer.\nVoice 2\nAfter 340 days, Scott Kelly returned to earth. But even after he left space, scientists continued studying him. Most of the changes did not last long. Some of his DNA was damaged. And, he had a harder time thinking as quickly as before. But several months afterward, he reported feeling normal again.\nVoice 1\nThese results are very important for future space travel. Not everyone’s bodies will change like Scott’s. Space affects everyone differently. It even affects women differently than men. But Scott Kelly’s year in space will help predict things that might go wrong. And it can help prevent these problems in the future.\nVoice 2\nSome people want to go even farther into space – maybe to distant planets or other solar systems. But there may be some danger in going to space. It is difficult to understand how the body might change even farther from earth. People traveling to other planets would be in space even longer. And they would encounter a lot of radiation. But probably, this will not stop the next generation of explorers. Space is just too strange. And what you might find there is too interesting. Scott Kelly has retired from NASA. But he still wants to go to space. John Logsdon is a historian. He studies the history of space travel. He spoke to Scott Kelly in 2018 about what it is like in space. Kelly said:\nVoice 4\n“Space is the most joyous and magical place I could think of.”\nVoice 1\nWould you go to space if you could? Why, or why not? Do you think people should travel into space? You can leave a comment on our website at www.spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are walking through a forest full of pine trees. A thin layer of snow covers the branches. And underneath, the hills are layered with mounds of snow and ice. It is hard to walk through. But the air is fresh, and the cold makes you feel alive. It is one of the most beautiful winter days you could think of.\nVoice 2\nBut a day like this can also turn deadly. Freezing temperatures can cause serious injury, and even death. The Lancet Planetary Health is a medical journal. In 2021, they published a study led by a team of researchers in Australia and China. The study found that almost half a million people die from extreme heat every year. But over four and a half million people die from extreme cold every year. More than half of the deaths from extreme cold were in eastern and southern Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa also had the highest cold-related death rate by population.\nVoice 1\nPeople often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in cold weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Today’s Spotlight is on how to stay safe in cold weather.\nVoice 2\nOne of the biggest dangers of the cold is called hypothermia. A person gets hypothermia when their body temperature gets too low. The human body naturally regulates its own temperature. When it is too hot, we sweat. When it is too cold, our bodies try to make heat. When a person is in the cold, it is almost like they are exercising. Their body is working extra hard to keep the temperature at the right level.\nVoice 1\nBut sometimes, the body cannot create heat fast enough. Or, it has no more energy to use. When this happens, the body’s temperature begins to drop. Soon after, the brain stops working correctly. This is one of the first signs of hypothermia. A person with hypothermia may have a difficult time remembering things. They may be confused, tired, or have a difficult time moving. This makes it even more difficult to get help.\nVoice 2\nHypothermia usually happens when a person is out in the cold for too long or they are not wearing enough clothing. Without proper clothing, the body will lose heat even more quickly. Strong wind can also lead to hypothermia. If it is very windy, the air will carry off heat from the body faster. This is why windy weather feels colder than it actually is. It causes us to lose more heat.\nVoice 1\nWhen a person has hypothermia, it is important to help them as soon as possible. Here is how you can do that. Bring them inside into a warm room. If they are awake, make them a warm drink. Try to warm the center of their body first: the chest, neck, head, and groin. Keep the person dry. If they have wet clothes, remove them. When a person is wet, their body will lose heat faster. Keep them wrapped in dry blankets. And most importantly, get them emergency help.\nVoice 2\nBeing in the extreme cold can also lead to frostbite. Frostbite is an injury where part of a person’s body freezes. When this happens, the water in their body turns into ice crystals. These crystals damage the body parts. And they make it impossible for blood to flow. Frostbite usually affects the body’s smaller parts like toes, fingers, cheeks, nose, and ears. A person who has frostbite will not be able to feel the affected area. The skin will get hard and change color. In extreme cases, frostbite can damage organs and skin.\nVoice 1\nIf you have never been in the cold, it can be difficult to understand the unique pain of frostbite. It is like being burned. But you are being burned by the cold. With very bad cases of frostbite, a person might not even feel it. Sir Ranulph Fiennes is a famous explorer who once had a bad case of frostbite. He was exploring in the artic when his supplies fell in the water. He had to reach in to pull them out. He told the magazine Esquire what happened next:\nVoice 3\n“The water was not all that cold. It was probably about 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But when I got my arm out of the water, it started getting cold very quickly. My fingers felt like dead wood. I could not bend them.”\nVoice 2\nSir Fiennes had fourth-degree frostbite in his fingers. There are four different types, or degrees, of frostbite. A person with a fourth-degree frostbite may never feel the affected area again. The area may die. In the most extreme cases, it may even fall off. In Sir Fiennes’ case, he lost most of his fingers. He was very lucky to not lose his hand.\nVoice 1\nIf someone has frostbite, it is very important to get them to a warm place. Place the affected area in warm water. Keep the area protected. Do not touch the area with frostbite. Moving or rubbing the area can cause more damage. When the area has warmed again, give the person pain medication. When blood returns to a frostbitten area, it can be very painful. You should also get them emergency care. Doctors may be able to save an area from dying.\nVoice 2\nMany people may not recognize symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite. But it is important to know how to prevent them. Here are some suggestions on how to stay safe in cold weather:\nVoice 1\nWear layers of clothing and cover all areas of skin. Wearing the proper clothing is very important in cold weather. It will keep the heat of your body close to your body. And clothing will protect you from the wind. It is very important to cover your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. These areas keep the least heat. They are very vulnerable to frostbite.\nVoice 2\nKeep yourself dry. If you are sweating in cold weather, you may be wearing too much. Take off a layer of clothing. You will still be protected, but you will not be wet.\nVoice 1\nAvoid drinking alcohol when you are in the cold for a long time. Alcohol opens up a person’s blood vessels. Blood will rush away from the important parts of a person’s body. Blood carries heat. So, a person will lose heat in the important areas of the body.\nVoice 2\nKnow your body. Some people may suffer more from the cold. These include older people, and people with bad circulation. These people should avoid being out in the cold for too long.\nVoice 1\nFinally, keep active. The body warms in the cold naturally. Staying active will help keep the body warm.\nVoice 2\nDo you have experience with the cold? What tips or tricks do you have to stay warm?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nDr. David Vaughan works in his laboratory. It is located at Mote Tropical Research Centre in Florida, in the United States. Dr. Vaughan’s laboratory is not a small room like other laboratories. He works outside by the ocean. Vaughan is a marine biologist. He works with very small creatures that live in the sea. People may not think this work is very important. But Dr. Vaughan has a question for such people. He asks:\nVoice 3  \n“Do you like to breathe?”\nVoice 2  \nAll life on earth depends on life in the ocean. Human activities have been destroying ocean life for many years. But now there is some good news for the oceans. Today’s Spotlight is on Dr. Vaughan’s work with underwater animals called corals.\nVoice 1  \nMany people think that coral is a plant or a shell. But corals are small animals that live under the ocean. These animals group together. They create beautiful shells made of minerals. This shell can grow in many colours and shapes. It can look like a wrinkled brain or a cabbage. It can even look like a tree or grow into tall, round pillars.\nVoice 2  \nMany coral shells together are called a coral reef. Reefs are found in more than 100 countries around the world. The largest and most famous is the Great Barrier Reef. It is off the north-eastern coast of Australia. This reef is thousands of kilometres long. Coral reefs can be large but they are also very delicate – it is easy to destroy them.\nVoice 1  \nA lot of the world’s coral has died. This is mostly because of changes in the environment. People pollute the water and cause changes to the oceans. Rising carbon dioxide levels are making the ocean hotter and more acidic. People also overfish – they catch and remove the fish that support coral.\nVoice 2  \nThe World Resources Institute did a study of coral reefs in 2011. They found that 60 percent of the world’s coral reefs are threatened. And they think that by 2030 more than 90 percent will be in danger.\nVoice 1  \nThis would be very bad for the earth. Coral reefs are not just beautiful underwater areas. They are also homes for thousands of different species of creatures. This includes many kinds of fish, plants, and other underwater animals.\nVoice 2  \nReefs are important to land too. Corals provide a barrier for many coastlands. Reefs protect land from high water and strong winds. They can stop damaging forces before they hit the coast.\nVoice 1  \nAnd reefs are good for people too. Recently, scientists have found that parts of coral can be used to treat diseases such as cancer, arthritis, asthma, and heart disease.\n Voice 2  \nFinally, creatures on land – including humans – need underwater creatures like coral to be able to breathe. The plants in the ocean produce most of the world’s oxygen gas. These plants depend on coral for protection and particular chemicals.\nVoice 1  \nScientists like David Vaughan have worked for decades to find ways to protect the coral reefs. Vaughan is over 60 years old. He has seen the coral reefs decrease over his lifetime. This made him very sad. But one day, he discovered something new to him. It was a very simple technology. And it changed everything for him. In a video published by The Atlantic, Dr. Vaughan said:\nVoice 3  \n“Ten years ago I was planning to work for two more years. But when we saw that there was this new technology for restoration, I had to stay working until it was done.”\nVoice 2  \nThe new technology that Dr. Vaughan discovered is called “micro-fragmentation”. This technology works with micro-fragments – very small broken-up pieces. Scientists break the corals into small pieces. The coral grows very quickly using its own natural healing process. Using micro-fragmentation, corals grow 25 to 50 times faster than they would in other situations.\nVoice 1  \nDr. Vaughan discovered this process accidentally. One day he broke an old piece of coral apart. He thought it would die but it did the opposite! Vaughan told the Herald Tribune about it.\nVoice 3  \n“I picked up the coral, expecting to see it was worse. But it had completely grown over a hole the size of a large coin. From birth, it took that coral two years to grow to that size and it had grown back in two weeks.”\nVoice 2  \nDr. Vaughan’s team is now producing thousands of corals by micro-fragmentation. They work mostly with the coral in Florida Reef Tract, on the south-eastern coast of the US. They grow the coral in large tanks of water in his research laboratory. Then they put them back into the ocean. They attach the new corals to old corals that have died. Some of the new planted coral has died. But most of it continues to grow. And Dr. Vaughan and his team are learning more every day about how to make the new coral successful.\nVoice 1  \nThese fast-growing corals are an amazing new hope for oceans. But Dr. Vaughan himself also brings hope. Many people who are Dr. Vaughan’s age stop working and retire. But he is continuing to work. Lindsay Arick works with Dr. Vaughan. She talked to the AARP – an organization in the United States for people over 50 years old. In a video, she said:\nVoice 4  \n“Dr. Vaughan has seen the coral reef destroyed even more than any of us has. He saw it when it was beautiful. Now I may see it when I am Dr. Vaughan’s age the way he saw it when he was my age! So we are going to switch the generations. I can finally see what the reef looked like 60 years ago compared to now.”\nVoice 2  \nDr. Vaughan says that he will not stop working until there are a million corals back on the reef. He thinks this can be done in three to five years. He tells the AARP why he thinks his method will be successful. He says:\nVoice 3 \n“People think that we have ruined this planet with technology. But with technology we can bring it back.”\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen coral in real life or pictures? What do you think people can do to protect areas of coral?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are in a meeting at an office building. Your boss is speaking about next week’s project. Then, everyone takes a break for lunch. But you do not go to a restaurant or store. Instead, you exit the room. Inside the walls of the building are thousands of plants. Some produce fruit, some produce salad greens. You grab a small plate, go to the wall, and pick the ingredients for your lunch. Then, you sit down under a tree and begin to eat. You are 30 stories above the ground.\nVoice 2\nThis may seem like a fantasy. But this describes plans for a real building called the Jian Mu tower. It will be built in Shenzhen, a city in southern China. And it may represent the future of cities. Today’s Spotlight is on the Jian Mu tower and the future of cities.\nVoice 1\nThe Jian Mu tower is a kind of vertical farm. It is not the first vertical farm. Vertical farming is already happening in some countries. The country with the most vertical farms is the United States. But there are vertical farms in many countries, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UAE. Many of them grow leafy green vegetables like lettuce and kale. Economic experts consider vertical farming a growing market. But the Jian Mu is one of the biggest planned projects.\nA vertical farm; CC BY-SA 3.0\nVoice 2\nThe Jian Mu tower will be a tall glass skyscraper. It will be 51 stories tall. It was designed to have offices and apartments. But it is also designed to grow plants. Each window will be filled with them. And the building will produce 270,000 kilograms of food every year!\nVoice 1\nCarlo Ratti is an Italian architect. He designed the Jian Mu Tower. He named it after a tree from old Chinese myth. In the story, this tree connected heaven and earth. Ratti designed the tower for the Chinese grocery business, Wumart. The tower will be Wumart’s new headquarters. But people can also rent rooms there. Each person living in the Jian Mu tower will have their own garden.\nVoice 2\nBut these are not just any gardens. They are vertical gardens. And the whole tower is one big vertical farm. Vertical farms are different than traditional farms. Traditional farms need soil to help plants grow. But vertical farms use methods like hydroponics. These methods give water and nutrients to the plants directly. They do not need soil.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming also lets farmers put plants anywhere. In a vertical farm, farmers hang plants above and beside each other on a wall. Sometimes, they use special lights to help the plants grow. Others, like the Jian Mu tower, hang plants by windows. The tower is so high, the plants get plenty of sun. Doing this also has another benefit: When plants take in sunlight, they also take in heat. This helps control the climate in the tower. So, the tower will use less energy.\nVoice 2\nVertical farms can be very efficient. Traditional farms can only grow food at some times of the year. But vertical farms can grow plants all year. Some vertical farms trap rainwater. They can recycle the water they use. So droughts – or reduced rain – do not affect the farms. The Jian Mu tower will even get moisture from the air. But vertical farms are a very good use of space. They use far less land than a traditional farm. Brian Moeljadi is the manager of a vertical farm. He told Spectrum News:\nVoice 3\n“With the area of growing, you usually expand out. But with this, you are expanding up. You use less water and land. And you create less waste. It is a more sustainable way to farm.”\nA traditional lettuce farm; Image by NT Franklin from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nToday, environmental experts encourage people to use land efficiently. They want people to use natural resources in the best way possible, with the least amount of waste. Land efficiency will be especially important as the world’s population grows. Dickson Despommier is a former professor at Columbia University. He invented the modern idea of vertical farming. He talked to the website Big Think.\nVoice 4\n“We expect the human population to increase. So, over the next 40 years, you might have three billion more people to feed. And you look around for the land where that food will come from, and you do not find it. It is not there. So, the biggest problem facing the global population is: Where will the food for the next three billion people come from? So, it could come from someplace other than a traditional farm. The question is, could vertical farms solve that problem?”\nVoice 2\nEfficient use of space is important for another reason. It helps fight climate change. According to the World Health Organization, over 50 percent of the world lives in cities. But most of our food does not come from cities. It comes from the country. This means that people living in cities must ship food into the city. The food must come from even farther if it is not in season. Some fruits, like avocados, can travel for thousands of miles before people buy them. This uses a lot of fuel. Food producers must also use preservatives to keep the food fresh. This damages the environment. It also adds to climate change.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming might help reduce these problems. A traditional farm cannot fit in a city. But a vertical farm can! The Jian Mu tower shows that even if you live in the city, there can be a farm in your home. Much of the food people eat in the tower will come from the tower itself. They will not have to go anywhere to get it. They will not have to ship as much food in. And the food will be grown without pesticides or preservatives. It will be better for the people and the environment.\nVoice 2\nVertical farming can even help in places where people cannot grow food. Fukushima is a city in Japan. It once had several nuclear power plants. In 2011 there was a big earthquake. The earthquake caused a tsunami. This huge wave hit Japan and caused terrible damage. The power plants in Fukushima melted down. This contaminated the area with radiation. People could not go there without getting very sick. People in Japan were very scared of the radiation. They did not want to eat food grown anywhere near Fukushima. So, the government funded vertical farming. These new farms were safer than traditional ones. They allowed people to have fresh food, without fear of radiation.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming is not a perfect solution to these problems. A vertical farm can cost a lot of money to build and run. Some vertical farms use lights to grow plants. They also keep their plants in controlled climates. This uses a lot of energy. It can even lead to more pollution, making climate change worse.\nA vertical farm that uses lights; By ifarm.fi – iFarm_salads_small.jpg, CC BY-SA 4.0\nVoice 2\nBut many people believe that they can overcome these problems. They believe buildings like Jian Mu tower will help. Carlo Ratti even believes that buildings like this are the future of cities. He writes:\nVoice 5\n“This approach will be a big part of the design of future cities. It is an answer to one of today’s most difficult building design challenges. That is: How do we bring the natural world into building design?”\nVoice 1\nWould you live in a place like the Jian Mu tower? Would you like to work in one?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nJess Wade is a research scientist at the Imperial College in the United Kingdom. In fact, Wade is a good scientist. But Wade is also a woman. This can make her job a challenge. Sometimes it does not matter how good a scientist she is. That is because the people she works with treat her differently because she is a woman. In a video for the website Now This News she says,\nVoice 3  \n“As a woman, people expect you to do the day-to-day tasks. Or order the food or get the meeting room. Or look after the students. Those kind of things. And there is a problem with those jobs falling on women in subjects like science and engineering. These are kinds of housekeeping jobs. These jobs will not get you recognized as a scientist. They are not work that will get you a better job.”\nVoice 2  \nWade wanted to change this. She did not just want to make her own life better. She wanted to make life better for all women. In this way, she would make life better for all people. Today’s Spotlight is on Jess Wade’s work to recognize women in science.\nVoice 1  \nWade is not the first person to notice that women in science do not get the credit they deserve for their work. She learned about this issue from Alice White. White is a scientific historian. She helped Wade understand the problem by thinking about Wikipedia. Wade explained to Now This News,\nVoice 3  \n“Alice told me that of all the people with a page on Wikipedia, only 17 percent are about women. You could be looking up some kind of new solar material. Or you could be looking up a building in Florence, Italy. And the people that you read about will be men. And that frightened me.”\nVoice 2  \nWikipedia is the fifth-most used website in the world. It is a free collection of human knowledge. The English version gets over 500 million views each month. There are over 300 different language versions of Wikipedia. Websites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Amazon use Wikipedia for information.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nAnyone can write or change Wikipedia. The idea is that lots of people working together on something will be better than a few people. Wade believed she could use Wikipedia to recognize women scientists. So she learned how to create new pages on Wikipedia. She learned how to add to pages that needed more information. She began by writing one new page each day.\nVoice 2  \nThe first woman Wade wrote about was Professor Kim Cobb. Cobb is a climate scientist who works on coral reefs in the ocean. Professor Cobb did not have a Wikipedia page. So Wade wrote one.\nVoice 1  \nNext, Wade wrote a page about Susan Goldberg. Goldberg was the first woman to be editor of National Geographic. Goldberg did not have a Wikipedia page. So Wade wrote one. Then Wade wrote a page for another woman. Then another. Wade told The Guardian.\nVoice 3  \n“I have done about 270 pages in the past year. I had a target for doing one a day. But sometimes I get too excited and do three.”\nScreen capture of Susan Goldberg’s Wikipedia Page\nVoice 2  \nShe says that Wikipedia is a great method for representing these women. She continued,\nVoice 3  \n“Wikipedia is a really great way to involve people in this work. That is because the more you read about these amazing women, the more you get so inspired by their personal stories.”\nVoice 1  \nWade has been recognized for her work writing on Wikipedia. She has even won awards. But this is not her goal. Her goal is to make the world a better place for women in science. She speaks to girls at schools about choosing a job in sciences. She buys copies of books about women in science and gives them away. She would love for other people to help her write Wikipedia pages. But more than that, she wants everyone to help in any way they can. She explained to Now This News.\nVoice 3  \n“We could all do a better job of celebrating the women and under-represented groups who are in science and in engineering and technology. And in any job where you are in the minority. I think that at every chance we can, we should try and support someone else. And if you have been given a chance, that is so great! But then you have to help someone else at the same time.”\nVoice 2  \nSo what can you do to encourage women in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics? One simple way is to celebrate The International Day of Women and Girls in Science every year on February 11. This day celebrates women from around the world who work in areas of science or technology. Patricia Espinosa is an Executive Secretary for the United Nations, she explained the need for a day like this.\nVoice 4  \n“Amazing women through history have affected the world of science in important and life-giving ways. From the fourth century astronomer, Hypatia to Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhan. There is Tu Youyou of China. She discovered the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Yet women do not have enough representation in science and in engineering. This stops everyone from getting a better future for current and future generations. The International Day of Women and Girls in Science should celebrate their achievements. But it should also push all nations and organizations to find ways to open the doors to this large group of talented people.”\nJess Wade; Photo by Dave Guttridge, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1  \nYou can also do something every day of the year to recognize women in science. Every person knows girls and women who are, or could be, good in science. Encourage them to consider a job in science. Name someone for an award. Tell her to speak at a conference. Put her forward for a promotion, or better job. We can all do something, even if it is reading Jess Wade’s own Wikipedia page.\nVoice 2  \nAre you a woman in science?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nStorms. Floods. Mudslides. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. Most people know about the dangers of these natural disasters. But there is another natural disaster that can be just as dangerous as any of these. It is the heat wave.\nVoice 2 \nHeat waves can have deadly results. The World Health Organization says that between 1998 and 2017 over 160,000 people died because of extreme temperatures. But even without a heat wave, hot weather can be very dangerous. Working outside in the hot sun can affect people more than they know.\nVoice 1 \nPeople often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in hot weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of hot weather. Today’s Spotlight is on how people can stay safe in hot weather.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nA heat wave is a period of hot weather that lasts for several days. Heat waves are common. Some heat waves last only a few days, but heat waves can last much longer. Heat waves are the most dangerous when they last for more than a few days.\nVoice 1 \nExperts say that heat causes the most damage when outside temperatures stay high day to night. The middle of the day is usually the hottest. And then at night the temperature is cooler. A healthy person’s body can adapt, or change, during the day so that hot weather is not as dangerous to his body. Then, at night when the temperature is cool, his body can rest from the heat. But, if the temperature does not cool down at night, this causes serious problems for his body. His body has no time to recover.\nVoice 2 \nThe human body reacts to heat through its own cooling system. When we get too hot, our skin begins releasing water on its surface. This sweat on the outside of the body evaporates into the air. As the sweat evaporates off the body, the person gets cooler.\nVoice 1 \nThis natural cooling system works well for short periods of time. But it is possible for a person to release too much water as sweat. If he does not put enough water back into his body, he could become dehydrated. Dehydration is one of the most common problems in hot weather or a heat wave. Someone who is dehydrated may have trouble thinking or working. This is because lack of water affects the working of the brain.\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nSomeone who is dehydrated should avoid working too hard and sweating. He needs to put water back into his body. So, he should also drink lots of water. If he does not, his dehydration could lead to more serious problems.\nVoice 1 \nThere are three main illnesses that come from extreme heat. These are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\nVoice 2 \nHeat cramps are quick painful muscle movements that a person cannot control. A person can get heat cramps when she is in very hot weather and has not had enough water. They are most common when a person has also been doing a lot of physical activity. If a person has heat cramps, you should move her to a cool place. Then give her plenty of liquids. A sports drink is a good choice. But coconut water, milk, or water are also very good in this situation.\nVoice 1 \nHeat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. A person with heat exhaustion may have cool wet skin. He may sweat a lot and feel dizzy or faint. He may feel as if he will be sick or have a headache. His heart will beat quickly, but weakly. He may even fall to the ground. If it is not treated, it can be very serious.\nVoice 2 \nHeat exhaustion can develop quickly. But it may also develop slowly over a few days. Often, the victim may not even observe the changes and problems happening in his body.\nVoice 1 \nDuring heat exhaustion, his body is trying to make his body temperature normal again. You can help his body cool down. A person with heat exhaustion should immediately stop working. He should rest in a cool place. They should remove any warm clothing. You can give him cool, wet clothes to put on his skin. And most importantly, he should drink liquids like sports drinks, coconut water, milk, or water.\nVoice 2 \nIf heat exhaustion goes untreated, it may develop into heatstroke. This is the most damaging and dangerous problem that comes from hot weather. During heatstroke a person’s average body temperature rises to over 40 degrees Celsius.\nVoice 1 \nOne sign of heatstroke is that the person becomes confused. He may not be able to answer simple questions. The person’s skin may be dry and red or lighter than normal. He may feel as if he will be sick. And he may take short fast breaths and have a fast but quiet heartbeat.\nVoice 2 \nIf his body temperature rises above 42 degrees, his body will even begin to damage his organs. This can result in permanent brain damage or even death. A person suffering from heat stroke must get treatment immediately.\nVoice 1 \nIf you think someone is suffering from heat stroke, it is very important to help them. Here is what you can do. Remove the person from the heat. Take off his clothes and pour cool water over his body. The water will begin to evaporate and help to cool him down. Place a cool, wet cloth on his skin under his arms and on his neck. Blood vessels are very close to the skin in these areas. The cloth will help to cool his blood and his body. Make sure you get emergency help as soon as you can.\nVoice 2 \nMany people may not recognize these signs of heat sicknesses. But it is important to know what they are and how to treat them. Here are some more suggestions about how to stay safe in hot weather:\nVoice 1 \nTry to stay out of the sun. Use a sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun. Sun can badly burn a person’s body. This affects your body’s ability to cool itself. If you are in the sun and begin to feel sick, find a cool place immediately. Sit under a tree or go inside to drink some liquids.\nPhoto by Kindel Media from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nDo not plan too much work or activity for the hottest parts of the day. Save those things for when the weather is cooler.\nVoice 1 \nDrink as much water as you can. Avoid alcohol, tea, coffee, and drinks with a lot of sugar. These make your body use more water than they provide.\nVoice 2 \nWear light-colored clothes. Dark clothes make a person feel hotter. And the clothes you wear should be loose – just a little big for your body.\nVoice 1 \nKnow your own risks. Some medicines or medical conditions can increase the risk for problems in hot weather. If you are more at risk, make sure you are able to stay cool.\nVoice 2 \nFinally, if the weather is extremely hot, protect the weaker members of your community. Extreme heat causes the most harm to people over 65 years old and children who are less than four years old.\nVoice 1 \nIt is important that people know and recognize the dangers of hot weather. Knowing these signs could help you save someone’s life. They could even help you save your own! Be safe about hot weather.\nVoice 2 \nIs hot weather a concern in your country?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nPicture a dark black sky. Suddenly, a large line of light appears. It looks like someone cut through the sky with a knife. The light shines through the opening.\nVoice 2 \nNow, the light begins to move. It gets softer. It starts to look green in colour. The lines of light move around the sky. They look like they may touch the ground very far away.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThen, a burst of light appears! There are more colors now. They look like rays of sunshine all over the sky. The lights are changing very fast. They form a large curtain. The curtain moves. It looks like it is dancing. The lights dance away back into the dark black sky.\nVoice 2 \nThese lights in the sky are called the Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. Today’s Spotlight is on these Northern Lights.\nVoice 1 \nPierre Gassendi was a famous scientist and philosopher in the early 1600s.  He was the one who named the Aurora Borealis. This name comes from Ancient Roman stories. Aurora was the name that Romans gave to the goddess of the dawn – the rising of the sun. The second half, Borealis, is named after the north wind. So in English Aurora Borealis means “the dawn of the north.”\nVoice 2 \nIf you live in the Northern part of the world you may have seen the northern lights before. They also appear in the far south. There they are called the Aurora australis. The Northern Lights appear in many colors. People most often see green or red. The color is different depending on how far north or south you are. The Northern Lights also look different at different altitudes – they look different high up in the mountains than at sea level.\nThe Northern Lights in Scotland, Isle of Mull; Image by mcbeaner from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nBut what are the Northern lights? What causes them? People have been wondering about this for years. The Northern lights are a part of folk culture in many countries. People around the world have traditional stories that explain the Northern lights. Here are a few of them:\nVoice 2 \nDuring the Viking period, people thought that the Northern Lights were images of young women who were dead. Other people believed that the northern lights were signs of huge fires in the north. And other people thought that it was God lighting up the cold, dark parts of the world.\nVoice 1 \nInuit people believe that the lights are the land of the dead. They believe that dead friends in this land try to connect with living people. They think that this is what is happening when the lights change very fast.\nVoice 2 \nThe lights often change shape and color. The Scots call them “merry dancers” because of this movement. Some Native Americans believe that they can connect with spirits of the dead by whistling at the lights.\nVoice 1 \nDanish people have a traditional story about the Northern Lights. They say that a group of large white birds called swans once flew too far north. The swans got caught in the ice. They moved their wings up and down, flapping to get free. Every time they flapped their wings, they made images in the sky. These images became the northern lights.\nVoice 2 \nBut not every country had a nice story about the Northern Lights like the Danish. Some cultures believed that the Northern Lights represented evil. They were afraid of the lights. They thought the lights were a terrible force. And many people believed that the Northern Lights caused natural disasters, like earthquakes or floods.\nVoice 1 \nThese traditional stories are very interesting. But there is a scientific cause of the northern lights – the Sun!\nVoice 2 \nSometimes there are storms on the sun. These storms release a cloud of solar particles into space. The solar particles are made up of atoms that have a magnetic charge. They are full of electric forces.\nVoice 1 \nSome of these magnetic solar particles come near to the earth. When they do, they are pulled in by the earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls the particles to the two magnetic poles on the earth: the North Pole and the South Pole.\nA representation of Earth’s magnetic field By Drdan14 at the English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0\nVoice 2 \nThe Northern Lights appear when the solar particles crash into the gas of the earth’s atmosphere. More solar particles make the lights bigger and brighter. In certain years, the sun has more storms. During these times, the northern lights can be seen from farther away. They may also be larger than usual. Rachel VanderVeen lives in Northern Canada. She says that the year 2012 had many solar storms. She tells Spotlight what happened:\nVoice 3 \n“My husband does not often run. But one day he was walking home from school when the northern lights began. They moved across the dark sky in many colours. Even with the light from the town, they were amazing. Usually, we see the Northern Lights in bright green. But that day the colours made my husband run to find me. The lights were pink, purple and orange. We have lived in the north for many years now. That was the first time we have seen so many bright colours.”\nVoice 1 \nYou can see why so many people believe that the Northern Lights are special. People travel from all over the world just to see the Northern Lights. But it is difficult to capture such an amazing sight.  Some people spend days taking pictures of the lights.  Other people try to describe the northern lights in words. Today’s program ends with a part of a poem about the Northern Lights. It is called ‘The Aurora Borealis’ by S. Moore:\nVoice 4 \nThe Aurora Borealis or northern light\nWith its movements so strangely bright,\nMoving and dancing along the sky –\nA picture of beauty to please the eye.\n\nHow sweetly the shining particles fly!\nHow quickly the flashes of light in the sky!\nYou would think the young angels had gathered in crowds\nTo play hide-and-seek through the golden clouds,\n\nLet wise philosophers search out the cause,\nAnd tell me the Science of Nature’s laws;\nAnd how these magnetic rays of light\nEnrich the north of a frosty night.\n\nSo let the stories be what they may,\nI love to look on the bright display\nOf the ever moving, changing hues,\nSeen in these grand but short lived views.\nThe Northern Lights in Norway; Image by John Huang from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThe writers of this program were Sara DeKoster and Rena Dam.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nDo you recognize this sound? It is the small high noise of the mosquito. Mosquitoes are small insects with wings. They bite people and take blood from their bodies. When mosquitoes bite people they leave behind a small raised red area on the skin. People with mosquito bites may feel like they need to keep rubbing or scratching their skin in this area. These little insects are a problem for people and animals in many parts of the world. Today’s Spotlight is on mosquitoes. These interesting insects are a big problem.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThere are over 3,000 different kinds of mosquitoes. To some people, that is a very frightening fact! Many people know how dangerous mosquitoes can be. Some mosquitoes can carry diseases. They can give these diseases to people and animals. And some of these diseases cause death.\nVoice 1 \nBut people can stop mosquitoes. Let’s look at the life of the mosquito. When a female mosquito is full grown, she mates with a male mosquito. Then she begins searching for a “host.” A host is a person or animal that she can land on. A mosquito can sense a host from up to 35 meters away.\nVoice 2 \nMost mosquitoes do not travel very far. They usually travel less than a kilometer during their whole life. But some mosquitoes can travel far. Some mosquitoes can travel 160 kilometers in some conditions.\nVoice 1 \nWhen the female mosquito finds a host, she bites him.  Mosquitoes have a special mouth. When a mosquito bites you, it actually puts part of its mouth under your skin. The mosquito also releases chemicals into your body. These chemicals make your blood flow faster into the mosquito. These chemicals are also responsible for the red bumps that many people experience after a mosquito bite.\nA mosquito bite; Image by Hans Braxmeier from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nAfter a mosquito bites her host, she fills herself up with his blood. She is not eating this blood. Instead, she is storing it. This blood will be very important for her babies. They will use the protein in the blood.\nVoice 1 \nOnly the female mosquito bites a host for her babies. For food, mosquitoes live on nectar, or sweet liquid that comes from plants. Male mosquitoes live for only a short time after they mate. But a female mosquito can have a few groups of babies without mating again.\nVoice 2 \nMosquitoes grow through four separate periods of growth. These periods are called the egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This whole process takes about one to two weeks.\nVoice 1 \nWhen the female mosquito is ready, she lays her eggs. Different kinds of mosquitoes lay their eggs in different places. They can lay their eggs in a small container of water. Or they can lay their eggs in large wet fields. But all mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in some kind of water.\nVoice 2 \nMost eggs hatch in about two days. Then the baby mosquitoes are called larva. The larva lives in the water. During this stage, the larvae grow. They lose their skin four times. This is called “moulting.” After their fourth moult, a larva begins the pupal stage.\nWater like this is a perfect place for mosquito eggs; Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nDuring the pupal stage, young mosquitoes begin to move. They float on the surface of the water. A special skin surrounds the pupa. Inside this skin, the pupa is changing into an adult mosquito. This process takes about two days. When the mosquito is completely developed the skin splits open. And the mosquito is now an adult!\nVoice 2 \nThe adult mosquito comes out from the water. It must rest on the water to dry. Each part of its body must become hard. After its wings have dried, the mosquito can fly. And a short time after that, the mosquito can mate. Then the females go in search of blood to make more little mosquitoes. And the process begins again!\nVoice 1 \nMosquitoes live in many areas of the world. But mosquitoes live best in a warm climate. And since they have so much contact with blood, they can be very dangerous. Mosquitoes can carry terrible viruses like west Nile, yellow fever, and malaria to humans and animals. These viruses create disease in their human hosts that can kill them. But not all mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. In fact, many mosquitoes do not carry viruses at all. However, it is difficult to know which mosquitoes are dangerous and which ones are not.\nVoice 2 \nMany people try to avoid mosquitoes. But have you ever noticed that mosquitoes seem to bite some people more than others? In fact, scientists believe that about 20 percent of people are more likely to get mosquito bites than others. Scientists who study mosquitoes believe that mosquitoes are attracted to, or pulled in, because of particular chemicals that come off people’s bodies. Some people produce more of these chemicals than other people. Mosquitoes can also smell the chemicals in the air a person breathes out.\nVoice 1 \nThere are ways to avoid mosquitoes — to stay healthy and for your own comfort. Here are some ways to avoid, stop, or kill mosquitoes near your home.\nVoice 2 \nFirst, do not let water sit for a long time. Mosquitoes need this still, stale water to lay their eggs. Experts say that this is the most important thing to do to avoid mosquitoes.\nVoice 1 \nSecond, mosquitoes usually go out more in the early morning and early night. A person can avoid mosquitoes by not going out at these times.\nMosquitos coming out at sunset; Image by Kranich17 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThird, in areas where mosquitoes are dangerous, use screens or nets over sleeping areas. These fabrics have many very small holes. The holes are big enough to let air through. But mosquitoes cannot fit through the holes. Also, nets that are treated with chemicals that kill insects are very helpful for stopping mosquitoes and malaria.\nVoice 1 \nFinally, when you can, wear clothes to cover most of your skin.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2004, a news reporter had a special story on Chinese television. The news reporter talked with a six-year-old girl. The reporter’s name was Chai Jing. Chai worked for China Central Television. She was reporting in the village of Xiaoyi in the highly-polluted area of Shanxi. Shanxi has many coal plants, and the air is very dirty. Chai asked the little girl in Xiaoyi:\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen a real star?\nVoice 4 \nNo.\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen blue sky?\nVoice 4 \nI have seen sky that was a little blue.\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen white clouds?\nVoice 4 \nNo.\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing could not forget about this little girl. Ten years later, she made a documentary film about air pollution in China. She called it “Under the Dome.” Chai released her film on Saturday, February 28th, 2015. In three days, people had watched it more than 150 million times. In one week, people had watched it more than 300 million times. Around one fifth of China’s population has seen it! Today’s Spotlight is on the Under the Dome film.\nScreenshot from the documentary film Under the Dome by Chai Jing, showing pollution in Chengdu in 2014.By Source (WP:NFCC#4), Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=45627907\nVoice 1 \nLess than 10 years after Chai talked with the little girl in Xiaoyi, she had her own baby girl. In fact, having her baby was the main reason she made the film. Chai was worried about her child. Chai lived in Beijing with her daughter. The air there is very polluted. Chai was careful with her daughter. She did not let her daughter play outside her house very often. Chai knew that one day, her little girl would ask her, “Mommy, why did you not let me outside to play?” Chai wanted to have answers for her daughter. She spent her own money making the film. And she took a year researching three questions: One: What is pollution? Two: Where does it come from? And three: What can we do about it.\nVoice 2 \nIn the film, Chai performed an experiment. In her home city of Beijing, she wore a pollution measuring device. She wore the device for 24 hours – one whole day. The device measured the kinds and amounts of pollutant chemicals in the air. Chai wore the device to her normal places, for her normal daily activities. The results of her experiment were shocking. In 24 hours on a normal day, Chai breathed in five times the legal amount of pollutants in China. And China’s legal limits are three times as high as the World Health Organization’s advised limits. Chai is especially concerned about Benzo[a]pyrene. This poisonous chemical causes cancer. On the day of the experiment, Chai breathed in 14 times the legal limit of Benzo[a]pyrene.\nVoice 1 \nChina does have laws about pollution. It also has a Ministry of Environmental Protection, or MEP. In 2012, the government created an “Air Pollution Prevention Plan.” Officials began to measure and announce the amounts of pollutants in the air. But Chai’s film shows one of the main problems. No one enforces the laws against pollution.\nVoice 2 \nIn one part of the film, Chai is with MEP officials. They are driving on the road, and they see a truck with a black cloud around it. The cloud is so large Chai thinks something is on fire. But it is just the pollution coming from the truck. So Chai and the MEP officials follow the truck. They want to see where the truck is getting its fuel. Chai and the MEP officials find a public fuel station. They ask the owner if they can test the quality of the gas. The owner refuses. He takes their MEP identification and will not give it back. Chai protests. She tells the owner that the MEP officials have the responsibility and the authority to test the fuel. The owner says,\nVoice 5 \n“You have the responsibility, but not the authority.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThis, Chai says, is the problem. Every day, individuals and businesses break environmental laws in China. But no one is punished. One MEP official told her,\nVoice 6 \n“We do the required steps. There is nothing we can do if the businesses do not stop. This is a kind of helplessness.”\nVoice 1 \nThe film “Under the Dome” was on the internet in China for one week. After that, the Chinese government began to block it on the internet. But it still had influence. After three weeks, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang talked publicly about enforcing pollution laws. He said,\nVoice 7 \n“Last year I said that the Chinese government would declare a war against environmental pollution. This year we will work to make sure that the new environmental protection laws are enforced.”\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing’s film had a particular goal. The film asks the government to force factories and businesses to announce their pollution levels. These pollution levels should be public information. She also tells people to report broken rules to the MEP.\nVoice 1 \nIn one part of the film, Chai gives an example of this. The building where she lives has a food restaurant. Every day, cooking smoke comes out of the restaurant. Chai thought this was normal. But then she discovered that there is a rule about cooking smoke. All restaurants should have smoke filters to block their pollution. So she called the MEP. Very shortly, the MEP put a smoke filter in the restaurant. After that, the smoke problem was solved. Chai said,\nVoice 3 \n“When the pollution was bad, I did not know where I would be tomorrow, or where I would be in the future. But when the restaurant owner put in the smoke filter, I felt like my feet had landed on solid ground.”\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing was happy when she saw the restaurant owner using the smoke filter. She knew that the difference to Beijing’s air pollution was very small. But she said,\nVoice 3 \n“One person knows that because they did one small thing, the situation improved a little bit. So when you look back at the war between people and pollution, you see this is how history is made. It is tens of millions of ordinary people. One day they say ‘No. I am not satisfied. I do not want to wait. I will stand up and do something. I will do it right now. At this time, at this place. I am going to do it.’”\nPollution in a city; Image by Ralf Vetterle from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where is the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nImagine these situations. A young man is walking in the hills. But he is lost. It is getting dark. The man cannot see anything. He falls and hurts his leg. Now he cannot walk and needs help immediately. But he does not know where he is. He cannot ask anyone to come and help him. He does not know how to tell anyone where to find him.\nVoice 2 \nA young woman is at an outdoor music event. During the event, she is planning to stay in a tent with her friends. She knows which field they are in. So, she walks around the field looking for them. But she cannot find their tent. She does not know how to find the exact position of her friends.\nImage by Leni_und_Tom from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever been in a situation like this? We do not always know where we are — even with modern technology. This can be annoying in some situations. But it can be very dangerous in other situations. Chris Sheldrick has created something that helps people when they face a problem like this. It helps people all over the world who cannot give an address or say where they are. It is called what3words. Today’s Spotlight is on Chris Sheldrick and his app what3words.\nVoice 2 \nChris Sheldrick lives in the United Kingdom. He worked in the music industry for ten years. He organised music events around the world. But every day he had problems with addresses. Musicians and people bringing their equipment often got lost when they tried to find an event. One day in Italy, a driver unloaded equipment at a place one hour north of Rome. But he should have unloaded it one hour south of Rome.\nVoice 1 \nSheldrick tried to get the people he worked with to use longitude and latitude to find where to meet. Marking places like this is exact. But it creates a line of 16 numbers to mark the place. It is too difficult to use. Sheldrick wondered if he could change these numbers into something easier.\nVoice 2 \nSheldrick had a friend who worked with mathematics. The two men worked together on this problem for six months. They found a simple way to talk about where a person was – their location. In a TED talk, Sheldrick explained what they did:\nVoice 3 \n‘We divided the world into three-meter squares. We found that we could name every three-meter square in the world separately with just three words. We used 40,000 words which is more than enough for the trillions of squares.’\nVoice 1 \nSo the men gave every square or place a separate three-word address. For example, their company building in London has the address ‘filled.count.soap’. And the door of the UK Prime Minister is ‘slurs.this.shark.’\nWebsite screen capture\nVoice 2 \nSheldrick called this new system what3words. He built an app people can use to find places this way. He knew that it could do much more than get musicians to the right place. He believed that what3words could help billions of people in the world who still live without an address. He told the Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n‘If you think about addresses, some are from centuries ago. Some are from last week. But there is so much of the world that does not use them. Complete countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, have only ever used directions.’\nVoice 1 \nSheldrick knew that people without an address sometimes struggle to get the same services as people who do have an address. For example, if you do not have an address you will find it hard to get a bank account, be listed to vote or receive a letter. So his company built what3words into many languages from Arabic to Urdu. This means what3words can help people in countries that do not have a good address system. It can help people in life or death situations. It can even help businesses work better.\nImage via what3words.com\nVoice 2 \nIn his TED talk, Sheldrick explained some of the ways that what3words has already been used.\nVoice 3 \n‘In Durban, South Africa, an organisation called Gateway Health provided 11,000 three word address signs in their community. Pregnant mothers can call the emergency services and use the signs to explain exactly where to find them. In the past, the ambulances have often taken hours to find the pregnant mothers. In Mongolia, the National Post Service uses the system. They are now taking mail to many people for the first time. The United Nations are using it to mark photos or pictures in disaster or trouble areas. They can then take aid to exactly the right place. Even Domino’s Pizza use it in the Caribbean. They want to get their food to people while it is still hot.’\nImage via what3words.com\nVoice 1 \nPeople all over the world use the what3words app. It is free to emergency services and individuals. In the United Kingdom, Jess Tinsley and her friends went for a walk. But they got lost. It was dark and wet, and Tinsley was near to tears. She said,\nVoice 4 \n‘We were in a field and had no idea where we were.’\nVoice 2 \nShe got a phone signal and called the emergency services. They told her to use the what3words app.  She quickly did this. The emergency services knew where she was in less than a minute. Soon they found and rescued Tinsley and her friends.\nVoice 1 \nIn Uganda, what3words worked with the Community Development Centre to bring 3word addresses to refugee camps in the area of Arua. The Centre will discover and record 3word addresses for every home and important building in the camp. This means health workers will be able to find people who need medical services. But it means much more than this. Sebit Martin is a leader at the Community Development Centre. On the what3words website, Martin explained why it was important for refugees to have an address.\nVoice 5 \n‘We want to give refugees the self-respect they deserve. We can improve their living conditions. 3word addresses will give everyone an easy way of talking about places. But these addresses are also a better language of hope in the refugee camp.’\nVoice 2 \nDo you have an address? Have you ever had problems finding a place? Would this app help you? Tell us about it.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nSimone was 14 years old when her life changed forever. She was sitting in her village school in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A group of rebel soldiers surrounded the school.  They were from the Lord’s Resistance Army or the LRA. The soldiers kidnapped all the students. They taught the goys to fight and become soldiers. They forced the girls to marry and have sex with other LRA soldiers. If the children resisted, the LRA soldiers beat or killed them.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nLife with the LRA was difficult for Simone. Soon she became pregnant. She had a baby boy when she was only 15 years old. Every day, Simone lived in fear.  She worried that soldiers would kill her or her son. After a year and a half, Simone finally escaped.\nVoice 1\nSimone was free from the LRA. But she was alone and afraid. Then, she met Sister Angelique Namaika. Sister Angelique helped Simone heal and become independent again. Today’s Spotlight is on Sister Angelique and the ways she is caring for female victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army.\nVoice 2\nSister Angelique Namaika has always known what she wanted to do with her life. When she was 9 years old, she lived in the town of Lege, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She remembers a German nun who visited the town. Angelique watched this female religious worker care for the sick. The nun gave out medicine and talked with the people who came to her. Angelique decided then that she wanted to become a nun too. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation, \nVoice 3\n“There was so much work to do. The nun did not have time to eat or rest. I told myself I will do everything I can to become like her. I will help her, so that she may rest.”\nVoice 1\nAnd this is exactly what Angelique did. In 2000, Sister Angelique completed the necessary studies to become a nun. In 2003, she began working in the town of Dungu. Dungu has many refugees. These refugees are victims of LRA violence. Like Simone, many of the women and young girls were kidnapped by the LRA. They suffered much fear and violence. They have escaped from the LRA, but they still suffer many problems.\nVoice 2\nMost of the refugees in Dungu do not own land. They also do not speak the local language. Many of the young girls have very little education They have not learned any skills to support themselves or their children. So they have no way to earn money.  Sister Angelique quickly recognized what she needed to do. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,\nVoice 3\n“We have to help women to become independent. They need to support themselves and their families without being forced to depend on their husbands. That way they learn their true value.”\nVoice 1\nSo Sister Angelique started teaching the women the local language. She teaches them how to read and write. And she listens to their stories. Often by talking together the women find support. They discover they are not alone. They are a community.\nVoice 2\nSister Angelique also teaches the women skills they can use to earn money. She teaches some women to sew clothes. Once they are skilled, they can make school clothes and other thins to sell in the market. Sister Angelique teaches other women to cook foods such as bread. They can sell this food in the market or by visiting houses in the community. Sister Angelique even helped a group of women start a garden. Together they panted seeds and cared for the plants. The women used the vegetables and foods from the garden to feed their families. And they sold what remained.\nVoice 1\nAfter a few years, Sister Angelique opened a centre in Dungu. It is called the Centre for Reinsertion and Development Support or CRAD. At this centre, she can teach many women at one time. The women can also come there to use common resources. But some women live too far away from the centre. So Sister Angelique rides her two wheeled bicycle to visit them.\nVoice 2\nBut Sister Angelique’s efforts do not just concentrate on teaching the women. A major part of her work is helping the women re-enter society. She works to help their communities accept them again. Sister Angelique told the Catholic News Service the story of one 14 year old girl.\nVoice 3\n“One problem she had was that she was rejected by her mother. Her mother said that the girl was responsible or being caught by the LRA. I gave the girl guidance and information. Then I ent to her mother’s house to help the mother and daughter talk and understand each other. So the two of them, the mother and the girl, they made peace and today they are on good terms. The girl is happy because she felt love.”\nVoice 1\nIn 2013, the United Nations Refugee Agency recognized Sister Angelique’s efforts. The organization gave her the UNHRC’s Nansen Award. This major award is given once a year to a person or group doing very good work to help refugees. But for Sister Angelique, the award is not just for her. She told the Al Jazeera news organization,\nVoice 3\n“The award is for the women. I hope it will help us with the basic work of helping them get an education and earn a living. People just want to be a part of something. This helps fight the pain and suffering that comes from their difficult experiences.”\nVoice 2\nOver the years, Sister Angelique has helped more than 2,000 women and children affected by the LRA. Bu she does not do this work to win awards or become famous. Sister Angelique described to Perspective Magazine how her Christian faith encourages her to work.\nVoice 3\n“The Lord identifies with those who suffer. So when I meet a suffering person I recognize that it is God appearing before me asking for help. Even if I have to get up in the middle of the night. I have to do it. I trust in God. It is He who gives me the courage and strength to keep on working.”\nVoice 1\nAnd Sister Angelique shows no signs of stopping. She has given her life to serve victims and refugees. She told the Thomas Reuters Foundation,\nVoice 3\n“I will never stop doing all I can to give them hope and the chance to live again.”\nVoice 2\nThe writer of this program was Courtney Schutt.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nSometimes people and objects from different parts of the world become connected in unexpected ways.\nVoice 2  \nDo you know how the following things are connected?\nVoice 1  \nFive hundred people from Eritrea and Somalia in Africa.\nVoice 2  \nA boat.\nVoice 1 \nA carpenter or wood worker from Italy.\nVoice 2 \nA radio.\nVoice 1 \nThe world-famous British Museum in the United Kingdom.\nVoice 2 \nThey are all linked by a small cross made from wood. Today’s Spotlight is on that small wooden cross – the Lampedusa Cross.\nVoice 1 \nOne night in October 2013 a boat was on the Mediterranean Sea. The wooden boat was too full. Over 500 men, women and children were on it. They were refugees from Eritrea and Somalia in Africa. They had escaped from the dangers of war, poverty, or oppression. And they were looking for freedom, safety, and a new life in Europe.\nVoice 2 \nThe refugees were tired. Many were sleeping. The people who were awake saw lights in the far distance. Land! But then something terrible happened. Fire! Everyone was very frightened. They screamed and cried loudly. Then the boat started to sink. Some people fell into the sea. One refugee, Selomun, later told the Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n“I was woken by people screaming. I had three or four seconds to react as the boat rolled over. Most people slid out of the boat and fell in the water, but I held on.”\nVoice 1  \nThen the boat sank under the water. Many of the refugees drowned. The others waited in the sea for rescue. Hours later some of them were saved by boats from the island of Lampedusa near Sicily, in Italy. Fanus was rescued. She told the Guardian about her experience,\nVoice 4  \n“They were the longest hours of my life. The rescuers saw my hands moving in the water, but my head was almost under.”\nVoice 2  \nOnly 151 people survived. The rescuers took them to Lampedusa. Francesco Tuccio lived there. He did not know the refugees. But he saw their suffering. He saw them crying for friends and family who had drowned. He told Refugee Stories Network what he saw.\nVoice 5  \n“I saw suffering. I even felt it with my own hands. I saw many dead people. Dead children. I held dead children. It was horrible.”\nVoice 1  \nTuccio wanted to do something for these refugees. He was a carpenter. So he used his skill with wood to do something special. He found wood from their wrecked boat. He thought the wood smelled of salt, the sea and even suffering. Tuccio knew the refugees were Christian believers. So from this wood he made each refugee a Christian symbol of hope. He made each of them a small wooden cross to wear.\nVoice 2  \nIn the next few years many other people tried to get to Europe by travelling across the Mediterranean Sea. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that over 1,000,000 people arrived in Europe by sea in 2015. But many boats were wrecked in the sea. More than 3,700 migrants died.\nVoice 1  \nDuring this time, Tuccio continued to make crosses for more refugees. He believed it was his duty as a man of faith to ease the suffering of those who survived. He also wanted more people to understand what was happening. And so he made larger crosses for many churches in Italy. In 2015, the BBC talked to him for a radio programme. Tuccio told them that he wanted to honour both those who died and those who survived. He explained,\nVoice 5  \n“Every time I make a cross I feel like I am saving a person. And for those migrants who made it to land, I want the cross to represent a new starting point. The cross is a symbol of re-birth and rescue and I want these people to have a better life.”\nVoice 2  \nIn the United Kingdom, Jill Cook heard the radio programme. Cook works at the British Museum in London. This famous museum stores and shows objects of permanent value to world history and culture. Cook was moved by Tuccio’s kindness. But she was also excited. A cross made by Tuccio could represent ALL the refugees who had travelled to Europe during this period in history. It could tell their story. She explained to the BBC why an object is important for the museum,\nVoice 6  \n“We do not show photographs or images at the museum. We only show objects. And so the migrants, who have nothing, were always going to be unseen. And then I heard about the carpenter and his crosses.”\nVoice 1  \nCook asked Tuccio to make a cross for the museum. He was happy and proud to do this. He knew that people from all over the world visit the British Museum. He later told the BBC,\nVoice 5  \n“I would like future generations to remember when they look at the wood that it is made from suffering. And I would like them to remember that the cross is the symbol of freedom and the coming together of people.”\nVoice 2  \nTuccio made the cross for the museum from wood from the boat that was wrecked in October, 2013. Cook remembers that everyone at the Museum went quiet when they saw the cross. Neil MacGregor was in charge of the Museum. He decided that the simple wooden cross was a very special object. He said,\nVoice 7  \n“This simple, yet moving, object is a special gift to the collection. Mr Tuccio’s kindness will allow all visitors to the Museum to consider this important time in the history of Europe. It is a great migration which may change the way we understand our continent. In my time at the Museum we have collected many wonderful objects. All of them have tried to shine a light on the needs and hopes that all humans share.”\nVoice 1  \nCook still feels strong emotion when she looks at the Lampedusa Cross. Tears come to her eyes. Many visitors to the museum react in the same way. The cross is only about 38 centimetres high. And the blue, green and yellow paint on the wood is damaged. But it is a powerful symbol of both suffering and hope in our time. One visitor told the BBC,\nVoice 8  \n‘I think the symbolism of it is amazing. For a symbol of hope to be made from the wreckage it is beautiful.’\nVoice 2  \nBut the Lampedusa cross is more than a memory of the past. Refugees still sail across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe. This is still dangerous. And thousands die in the sea every year.\nVoice 1  \nThe writer of this programme was Katy Blake.

In India and Pakistan, it is still the third most popular English language show. It is the television program “Friends”.\nVoice 1\nThis show is about the lives of six people: Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe. They are all friends who live in New York. They are always together. They drink coffee, eat meals, watch television, and do other things. Each character has a job. Each character has a family. But the important relationships in this show are the friendships. This is why the show is called “Friends”. \nVoice 2\nLife can be like this program. When a person moves away from their family, their friends can become the most important relationships they have. Or this can happen because of a bad relationship with parent. Or maybe a person’s family has died. These situations can make people look for new relationships. Today’s Spotlight is on when friends become family. \nVoice 1\nA program like Friends has all the things that people want in relationships. People want to feel  close to the people they love. They want to be able to talk about anything. They want to know  people for many years, sometimes even a lifetime. People want things to be easy. They want to be able to call a friend without planning and talk or eat a meal together. \nVoice 2\nDeborah Tannen is a teacher at Georgetown University. In 2016 she was writing a book about friendship. She talked to many people. She was surprised at how many people said that their best friends were like family.\nVoice 1\nThey shared stories and experiences with each other. They shared meals. One man said that  he did not really enjoy spending time with his friend, but that he had to, because the man was like family! Tannen understood that many of these people felt “close” to a person in some way a way that felt comfortable. Tannen thought about her own friend, Karl. She recognized how he had many of the things she wanted in a friend. She wrote: \nVoice 3\n“If I am angry or sad about something, I call him. I trust his judgement, though I might not always follow his advice. And most of all, there is comfort. I feel completely comfortable in his  home. When I am around him, I can be completely myself. I do not have to worry.” \nVoice 2\nFriends that make us feel at home are wonderful. But everyone knows that friendships are not  always easy. Even on a program like Friends, people fight with each other. Tannen writes,\nVoice 4\n“Just as with families, friends who are like family can bring happiness but also pain. The comfort of a close relationship can sometimes change and make you feel trapped. The closer the connection, the greater the power to hurt. Your friend may disappoint you or make you sad.”\nVoice 1\nThe people who understand us are people who have experienced what we have experienced. This is why sometimes friends become like family. Imagine two people serving together in a war. Thomas Brennan served in the United States military. He fought in wars both in Iraq and Afghanistan. He told the New York Times that,\n Voice 5\n“I feel pride in my country. I have seen things that made me sometimes regret my service. But I felt a calling to serve. In my case, it was because of the attacks of 9/11. I have learned that I will always belong to a brotherhood until I die. The military are my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe strong feelings for the people you fight with exist in militaries all around the world. In fact, it can be difficult for people who have served in war to make new friends. They are joined to other soldiers by very difficult situations. When they return home, they do not have the same people around them. Their family does not understand what they experienced. They can feel lonely. People who serve in the military sometimes need help connecting to NEW people when they finish their military service.\nVoice 1\nIt is not just war that connects people. Sneha Ashtikar moved from Mumbai, India to Paris, France. She only knew one person and was very lonely. In India, she talked to her mother every day. She missed this. It took time, but eventually her friends filled this need for her. Ashtikar told the website HelloGiggles,\nVoice 6\n“My friends are my family in Paris. Not only have they helped me through rough times, they have also shaped my personality in so many ways. My parents and friends back home are definitely supportive, but physical presence changes everything.”\nVoice 2\nAshtikar’s friends helped her find a place to live. They help her with other problems. They celebrate holidays together. And when she misses India, they help cheer her up. She says,\nVoice 7\n“If you are with the right people, your friends can lift you up and give you courage to survive any problem. It may relate to living in a different country or just being a human. They will be proud of you when you earn an achievement. They will teach you to love yourself. They will get mad at you when you are wrong. They will prevent you from making bad choices. Your friends will fill the hole and be your family.”\nVoice 1\nBut can your friends replace your family? It is difficult to know. Sometimes important relationships form between family members. Sometimes they happen between friends. We all need people in our lives who accept us for who we are. We all need people who will help us to grow and change. For many people, this is a family of friends.\nVoice 2\nWhat do you think? Do you have a friend who is so close that you think of them as family? Do you have a person in your family that you would call your best friend? Tell us about them. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIto wakes up at 6 in the evening. He wears the same clothes that he did yesterday. His crowded room is filled with empty drink bottles and food wrappers. A huge desk takes up one side of the room. When Ito wakes, he does not get ready for class. He does not get ready for work. Instead, he goes to his computer. And, he plays video games for the entire day Sometimes, his mother comes to bring him food. He thanks her, but says nothing else. Ito’s life is the same the next day, and the next. He has lived without seeing other people for the past three years.\nVoice 2\nIto is one of Japan’s hikikomori. A hikikomori is someone in Japan who withdraws from society. Usually, these are young men. They isolate themselves from other people. And they depend on their parents to survive. Today, there may be a million people living like Ito. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on the Hikikomori.\nVoice 1\nJapan has a very unique society. Traditionally, parents and children live together for many years. Several generations often live together at a time. And each family member supports the other. Younger people take care of the older, and everyone takes care of the children. This can be very positive for family members, knowing they will always have help. But it also lets people become hikikomori. A hikikomori knows someone will take care of them. So, they do not need to find a job or go to school.\nVoice 2\nBut people do not become Hikikomori because they do not want to work. It is usually because of a great pain. A hikikomori might have lost a job. Or, they might be bullied in school. They see these events as failures. And, once they have failed, it is difficult to try again. Masaki Ikegami is a journalist who writes about the hikikomori. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 3\n“The Japanese society makes it difficult for people to succeed once they have made a mistake. I think most hikikomori have had difficulty with their working life. They have been hurt by their human relationships there. Other cases might be people who have had bad experiences at school.  Or, they have been through troubles, accidents, or illnesses. Some have stopped working to stay at home and look after their aging parents. There are many different reasons. It can happen at any age.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori isolate for economic reasons. After the second World War, Japan’s economy grew quickly. College graduates got jobs easily. A person could get a job in a company. And that company would employ them for the rest of their lives. But in 1991, the economy crashed. Companies stopped hiring. Or they continued to employ older workers. It became harder and harder to get a good job. Many people had to find lower-paying work. Or, they did not find work at all. This economic time period is known as the lost decades.\nVoice 2\nThe lost decades hurt a lot of people. In Japan, much of a person’s self-worth is based on their job. Not having a job, or not doing well in a job, causes a lot of shame. And some people feel so worthless that they stop trying at all. Naohiro Kimura was a hikikomori for ten years. He told the Japan Times:\nVoice 4\n“If you finish University in Japan but do not get a job, people look at you strangely. People have a strong sense that you should be working. I was embarrassed. I did not want anyone to see me. When I saw someone wearing nice clothing, I would feel like I had caused trouble. I hated seeing working people. I would compare myself to them. It would make me feel very bad. I felt a strong sense of shame.”\nVoice 1\nMany hikikomori also have depression, a kind of extreme sadness. Often, a depressed person will want to move. They will want to work on things. But they feel that they have no worth. They believe their efforts will not change anything. So, they feel even worse, and become more depressed. It is difficult to recover from this way of thinking.\nVoice 2\nVosot Ikeida is a hikikomori in his fifties. He became a hikikomori when he returned to Japan after living in a different country. He felt that he could not fit into Japanese society. So, he became very depressed. He told the Japan Times,\nVoice 5\n“I closed all the curtains. But the light outside still reflected on the curtains. I could see it from the back of the room. It felt like society was continuing on without me. That feeling made me lonely and insecure. Curtains were not enough. So I blocked more light from my windows. I made it like a cave. It made no difference whether I slept in the daytime or nighttime.”\nVoice 1\nHaving a hikikomori child is also very difficult for parents. Many feel that they must continue to support their children. But they also feel responsibility. Most do not know how to help. And some fear talking about their children, because they also feel shame. Maika Elanis a photojournalist. She helped document the lives of many hikikomori. She told Muse Magazine:\nVoice 6\n“Parents know that people will see them differently if they talk about their children’s lifestyle. They expect them to return to normal for months or years before seeking help. Most parents feel that a hikikomori child shows they have failed. Having someone help with it islike getting rid of your responsibility as a parent. It is like getting rid of your child.”\nVoice 2\nOnce a person becomes a hikikomori, it is very difficult to go back to normal life. Most do not know how to live by themselves. And, they do not have the skills to find a new job. The Japanese government has opened up some jobs for hikikomori. And there are special programs to teach them skills, like cooking.\nVoice 1\nBut the most helpful programs for the hikikomori help them find friends. After all, a person who is lonely or depressed does not only need a doctor. They do not only need help with getting a job. They need someone who will tell them the truth. They need someone who will try and understand them. To make them feel like they are not alone.\nVoice 2\nDo you know anyone who is lonely?

I can change my attitudes. I have courage. I know what is right. I can fight hate. It begins with me. With me.\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the last in a series of 10 programs. In this series of programs, we have looked at 10 ways to fight hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center in the United States has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the 10th way to fight hate in your community: Dig Deeper.\nVoice 1\nHave you ever examined your own opinions and beliefs? No one wants to have hateful feelings toward other people. No one wants to judge people who are different. No one wants to have bad thoughts about particular races, religions, or nationalities. But we all do. We may not even know the feelings are there. But no one is perfect. We all have prejudices. These opinions and beliefs influence our actions and thoughts.\nVoice 2\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, or the SPLC, wants all people to dig deep inside their hearts. They want people to find the harmful feelings inside themselves and then change them. The SPLC believes that each person must decide for himself if he will be tolerant or not. Tolerance means that every voice matters. It means that all people are valuable no matter who they are or what they believe. Every person can learn, accept, and practice tolerance.\nVoice 1\nThe SPLC lists “Dig Deeper” as the 10th way to fight hate. But they really believe that it is the first step a person must take to be more tolerant of other people.\nVoice 2\nSo, what are some ways for people to dig deeper and change their harmful thoughts? The SPLC says that a good way to discover harmful feelings is to ask questions … of yourself! They want people to look hard at their lives and their experiences to answer these questions. Here are some examples of questions we all should ask ourselves about what we think and feel.\nVoice 1\nDo I spend time with people of other races and religions? Do I have friends who are different from me?\nVoice 2\nDo I live near people who are different than me? Do I work with people who are different? Do my children go to school with people who are different?\nVoice 1\nDo my friends and family tell hate-based jokes or laugh at people who are different from them? How do I react to their jokes? Do I have the courage to tell them to stop?\nVoice 2\nWhere do I get information about other cultures? Do I read about other cultures from books or magazines? Do I get information from real people of that culture? Or do I depend on films and television programs by others to tell me about other cultures?\nVoice 1\nDo I take time to learn from other people’s experiences? Do I listen to people who have different opinions from me? Am I willing to hear all people’s stories and opinions?\nVoice 2\nHow often do I feel like a minority in a group of people? Do I know how it feels to live in a place where no one is like me?\nVoice 1\nThese are sometimes difficult questions. But these kinds of questions help people dig deeper into their own thoughts and feelings. People may discover harmful feelings that they did not know about. And they can work to change them.\nVoice 2\nOne person who decided to dig deeper was Derek Black. Black grew up in Alabama, in the southern United States. His father had been a leader in the KKK. This hate group believed that white people are better than any other groups of people. The KKK often used violence to spread their message. They targeted black people, immigrants, people of different faiths, and others.\nVoice 1\nBlack’s parents and community taught him that the United States was only for white people. They taught him to suspect the worst of other races. They taught him not to believe the government or news sources. His parents even took him out of school. At home, they could teach him their beliefs. Derek Black believed in the message of the KKK. He even spread that message on his own radio program.\nVoice 2\nAs a young man, Black went to college. There, he hoped to learn how to enter politics. He believed this was the best way to bring the KKK’s beliefs to more people. But that is not what happened.\nVoice 1\nFor a few years, Black spread the message of the KKK. He continued his radio program. But the students at Black’s college discovered Black’s beliefs. They wanted to change his mind. One night, another student, Matthew, invited Black to his house for a dinner with other students. Matthew was a Jew. Black had said terrible things about Jews before. But Black decided to go. \nVoice 2\nAt the dinner, Matthew asked the other students not to talk about Black’s beliefs. He wanted Black to get to know them. Over the next months, Matthew continued inviting Black to these group dinners. Black began to get to know the students from different places. He learned more about them as people.\nVoice 1\nHe got to know this group of people who were different from him. He had conversations with them. And after a time, Black’s ideas began to change. He did not change his views immediately. But after a few years, he knew that his beliefs were not good.\nVoice 2\nFinally, Black left the KKK. He no longer believes that any group of people is better than others. He sees the value in diversity – gathering people from all different places. Black regrets his past actions and words. He knows that his beliefs affected people. He told the Washington Post,\nVoice 3\n“It is not just that I was wrong. It is that I caused real damage.”\nVoice 1\nHe does have hope for people who are like he was. But it does take work. He told PBS News Hour,\nVoice 3\n“I think you can see hope in every individual person who comes to a new understanding about things or changes. And so that is always my advice to other people who wonder what we could do. My advice is to just start with one person that you have a connection with. And that is the most important and powerful thing you can possibly do.”\nVoice 2\nThere are many problems in communities all around the world. These are problems like sickness, poor quality housing, hunger, and violence. But these kinds of problems can be solved if people with different ideas work together. When a community decides to first deal with hate, many good things can follow. It is a long and difficult process to fight hateful thoughts and actions. But there is a very important question for each person: why not start today? The most important step is the first one.\nVoice 1\nWill you make that first step? What steps can you make to examine your own thoughts and feelings? What steps can you take toward fighting hate today?\nVoice 2\nThis is the last program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice. Here are their 10 ways to fight hate:\nAct, Join Forces, Support the Victims, Speak Up, Educate Yourself, Create an Alternative, Pressure Leaders, Stay Engaged, Teach Acceptance, Dig Deeper.\nVoice 1\nDid you miss a program from this series?

It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nIn 2019, a group of researchers from York University in Toronto, Canada studied a group of school children. They showed each child the image of a face. Then they showed the child a neutral symbol. After they saw the symbol, researchers asked the children if the symbol was nice looking or not nice looking. The researchers were testing the feelings the children had about the faces. \nVoice 2\nThese researchers learned something alarming. Very young children already had opinions about people who were different from them. These opinions are called biases. Researchers learned that by the age of five, children already had biases about skin color. The children in this study gave more negative responses to images of boys with dark skin.\nVoice 1\nResearchers from Northwestern University in the United States did a similar study. They found that children as young as four have biases about people’s skin color. They have biases about gender, too. And they have biases about the way people talk!\nVoice 2\nThese studies show that every person can be affected by bias thoughts or feelings. Even very small children can have harmful opinions and biases. Young children can learn to judge people who are different to them. But where do these children get these ideas? And more importantly, how can we stop these harmful biases in children?\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the ninth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center in the United States has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the ninth way to fight hate in your community: Teach Acceptance.\nVoice 1\nAcceptance means accepting people for who they are. It means tolerating and respecting different opinions and beliefs. The Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, believes that children need to learn acceptance. And they need to learn it when they are very young. Otherwise, they may learn to hate. And studies like the ones at the beginning of this program show that children can learn to hate at a very young age.\nVoice 2\nThe SPLC says that one very important place to teach tolerance to children is school. School is a place where many different children come together in one place. In school, children talk, laugh and learn with other children.\nVoice 1\nThere are many ways to encourage children to celebrate differences in school. The SPLC even offers a Teaching Tolerance program. In this program, students take part in a special event every year. It is called Mix It Up at Lunch Day. At this lunch, each student sits next to someone they do not know. They have questions to help them have good conversation. They get the chance to learn things about someone new or different from them.\nVoice 2\nAnother way to teach acceptance is to have children tell stories about their families. By doing this, children learn about each other’s culture and traditions. They learn to value the different kinds of families that people come from.\nVoice 1\nTeachers can also teach tolerance by asking children to imagine what the world would be like if there was no hate. Martin Luther King Jr. was a famous black preacher in the United States. He fought for the rights of black people in the United States in the 1950s and 60s. At that time, black people were kept separate from white people. They did not have equal rights. \nVoice 2\nMartin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called “I Have a Dream.” In that speech he talked about his dream for the future. He dreamed that slaves and slave owners would sit together at a table as brothers. He dreamed that one day white children and black children would play together and hold hands peacefully. But most of all, he dreamed of a world where people would not be judged because of their skin color. Instead, they would be judged by their words and actions. \nVoice 1\nMany teachers ask their children to write their own “I Have a Dream” speech. They ask children to imagine a better and more accepting world. Then children write about their hopes for the future.\nVoice 2\nOlder children and young adults can learn more about tolerance by studying popular media sources like films and television. They can look at how the media presents different races, religions and ethnic groups. They can decide if they agree with the films and television programs. Some films and television programs use stereotypes. That is, they present groups of people as being all the same. People can see the dangers of presenting a group of people using stereotypes.\nVoice 1\nThese are just a few ways that the SPLC talks about teaching tolerance to children in school. But school is not the only place for children to learn tolerance. The most important place for a child to learn tolerance and acceptance is from adults, like parents and members of their community.\nVoice 2\nEvery adult is a teacher to children. Children copy the actions and words of adults in the community. You can teach a child tolerance by being a good example for her to follow. Show tolerance for the people you work with or meet in your community. If you are a tolerant adult, your children will be more tolerant too!\nVoice 1\nAcceptance is important for people of all ages to learn. You can examine your own thoughts and opinions. Are you tolerant of people who are different to you? Are there people in your community that you avoid, ignore, or try to forget? These things can be just as harmful as treating someone badly. We can all work to be more tolerant people. And that helps us teach tolerance to everyone we know. You can encourage other adults to be tolerant too. Parents can teach tolerance to their children. Teaching tolerance today can help stop hate tomorrow.\nVoice 2\nThis is the ninth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

How do you bring people together to make a positive change? Wagner is a city in South Dakota, in the United States. There are two main people groups in Wagner. There are many white people and there are Native Americans living nearby.\nVoice 2\nAnd like in many other places, these differences have led to racial tensions. Not all people are treated equally. This influences many parts of life. It makes progress in the town slow. The community wanted to improve these tensions. People from different backgrounds and different races joined together to achieve this goal.\nVoice 1\nIn 2008, they started with something simple, even though it was also very difficult: they talked to each other. The community in Wagner started study circles. These were small groups of people who met together. They discussed important issues in the community. People did not always agree. But they always respected each other.\nVoice 2\nThe community of Wagner saw the benefits of these study circles. They wanted these groups to continue. In the groups, they talked about hard issues. They talked about poverty. They addressed how people in the community had hurt people different than them. They wanted to fix this hatred. They wanted to bring more diversity to their city. They wanted to make life better for everyone in their community. They knew it would take time, and lots of work. They stayed engaged.\nVoice 1\nToday’s Spotlight program is the eighth in a series of 10 programs.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the eighth way to fight hate in your community: Stay Engaged.\nVoice 1\nSometimes, there is one act of hate that you can fight against. There is one rally or one hateful person. But usually, hate runs deeper. You may have to work for a long time to get rid of it. This Spotlight program is about how to fight hate when the problem is too big or too deep to go away quickly. Big problems like discrimination and racial hatred may take a long time to heal. People must work hard to get rid of hate in their communities. That hard work may take a long time. People must look toward the future.\nVoice 2\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, says that planning for your community’s future is important. Every community has problems. But when people do not look at or deal with the problems, the problems seem bigger. They become more difficult to solve. And the future of the community looks frightening. This is especially true with the problem of hate in a community. So, the SPLC encourages communities to stay engaged. That is, it is important that communities do not give up in the fight against hate. They must plan for the community’s future.\nVoice 1\nThe problem of hate does not usually come from outside a community. Instead, hate begins inside a community. Groups of people may blame each other for problems in the community. Or people may feel as if they have no voice in their community. They feel unsupported and powerless. Differences and change can cause fear. And fear can lead to hate.\nVoice 2\nCommunities can deal with fear and hate. The SPLC says that a tolerant and united community can stand against hate. Imagine a community that accepts people no matter who they are or what they believe. That community does not accept hate. Hate cannot exist if people do not let it. Stopping hate in your community will improve your community’s future.\nVoice 1\nBut where can you start? The SPLC says that the first step to changing your community is to change yourself! You can change the way you speak about people who are different than you. You can also change the way you think about people who are different than you. Do you have an opinion about a particular group of people? These opinions are biases. They can negatively influence your actions in your community.\nVoice 2\nChanges in individuals are very important. But changes in the whole community are important too. And there are many things people can do to encourage communication and tolerance in a community.\nVoice 1\nThere are many examples of groups who worked together and stayed engaged to fight hate in their communities. Here is one example you can use in your community!\nVoice 2\nEveryday Democracy is a group that helps communities discuss issues with each other. One way they do this is with study circles. These study groups are one way to start community discussions. We talked about how this worked in Wagner, South Dakota, at the beginning of the program. Study groups are safe places for different people to talk with each other about their opinions and beliefs. People from different groups can come together and get to know each other.\nVoice 1\nYou can start a study circle in your community. In fact, you can start any group to talk openly about the issues in your community. These groups should accept every person. They should respect every person’s opinion. And when people in a study circle talk, they do not always have to agree on everything. That is even part of the fun!\nVoice 2\nPeople who join study circles gain understanding of different people. They gain hope for a better future. They know that they can help to solve problems and conflicts in their community.\nVoice 1\nPeople in a community should be able to live together in peace. How will you help plan and influence the future of where you live? Hate will not disappear overnight. Stay engaged in the long-term fight against hate in your community.\nVoice 2\nThis is the eighth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice. Here are their 10 ways to fight hate:\nAct, Join Forces, Support the Victims, Speak Up, Educate Yourself, Create an Alternative, Pressure Leaders, Stay Engaged, Teach Acceptance, and Dig Deeper.\nVoice 1\nKeep listening to Spotlight to hear the complete series.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine a long, dirt road. The country around it is dry. Small, brown plants grow from the dry ground. A man lies on the side of the road. He is very hurt. Thieves have taken his money. They have beaten him very badly. Without help, he will die. Soon, two people from his country walk by. But they do not stop to help. Both believe they are too busy. Then, a third man passes by. He is not from the man’s country. Instead, he is from a foreign country. In fact, these two countries are at war. But instead of passing by, this third man stops. The third man shows kindness. He helps the injured man onto his donkey. He takes him into his home. He cares for the injured man, and nurses him back to health. It does not matter to this third man if the injured man is from a different country. He sees someone who is in trouble, and he helps.\nVoice 2\nThis is a story from the Christian Bible. It is called the story of the Good Samaritan. It tells Christian believers to be kind, even to their enemies. Most religions have stories like this. Most religions tell us to be kind to each other. These may seem like commands given with little reason. But did you know there are also scientific reasons why a person should be kind? Kind people are happier. And they may even live longer! Today’s Spotlight is on the science of being kind.\nVoice 1\nMost people know that being kind feels good. Helping someone in need makes us feel positive. And giving a gift to a friend feels as good as receiving one. But for most of human history, no one could say why. Giacomo Rizzolatti is an Italian Scientist. He studies how the brain works. In the 1980s, he and his colleagues performed an experiment that showed a lot about kindness. Rizzolatti used electrical scans to examine the brains of monkeys. When a monkey did something, part of the brain would show activity.\nVoice 2\nThen, Rizzolatti discovered something amazing. Sometimes, the monkeys would watch each other. When watching, their brains were also active. But they were active in the same way the other monkeys were. When one monkey reached out his hand, the other monkey’s brain looked as if it were doing the same. It was not reaching out. But the watching monkey’s brain experienced the event as if it were. Only special parts of the brain acted this way. Rizzolatti called them mirror neurons. Soon, he and his colleagues discovered the same thing in humans.\nVoice 1\nMirror neurons are very important to the science of kindness. Mirror neurons are the part of our brain that lets us feel what other people feel. They allow us to empathize. V.S. Ramachandran is a neuroscientist. He studies mirror neurons. He spoke to Greater Good Magazine about why he thinks mirror neurons are important for empathy.\nVoice 3\n“These mirror neurons are involved in empathy for pain. To really empathize with your pain, I need to experience it myself. That is what the mirror neurons are doing. They help me to feel your pain. I experience the same pain as if someone were to hurt me directly. That is the basis for all empathy.”\nVoice 2\nEmpathy is the first step toward kindness. It lets us know when people are sad or hurt. We know mirror neurons help us feel other people’s pain. But mirror neurons also allow us to feel when other people are happy. When we see others smile, we often smile. In being kind to others, we feel their happiness.\nVoice 1\nThe happiness we get from being kind also may be good for our health. When we are kind, our brain releases chemicals called neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters make us frightened, or angry. But the neurotransmitters released in kindness have positive effects. They make us feel good about our relationships, and more confident. But they also help our bodies. Oxytocin is one neurotransmitter released during a kind act. Oxytocin prevents stress. But it also lowers blood pressure. Marcie Hall is a psychiatrist at University Hospitals in Ohio in the United States. She spoke to the Healthy@UH podcast about the benefits of these neurotransmitters.\nVoice 4\n“Kindness actually protects your heart. It improves your body’s disease fighting system. It improves your energy. It reduces aches and pains. It can lead to a longer life. In the process, you also feel better about yourself.”\nVoice 2\nKindness and empathy are also very important to human society. They keep our relationships healthy. The good feelings we get from kindness make us want to help other people. And they encourage different groups of people to work together. Without empathy, our communities would be very different. They might not exist at all!\nVoice 1\nOne well-known theory is described as survival of the fittest. This idea is based on a theory by Charles Darwin. This theory says that the strongest and best people are the ones who will survive and continue. But Helen Riess disagrees with this idea. Riess is the director of a program that teaches people how to use and improve empathy. She wrote a paper called The Science of Empathy. In it, she explained why people have empathy.\nVoice 5\n“Why is the human brain designed this way? If life were only the result of “survival of the fittest”, we would only fight people. We would not care about responding to suffering. Our ability to see other’s suffering allows us to feel and understand their pain. The personal distress we feel often influences us to show kindness. The survival of humans depends on helping others. Being kind reduces our own distress.”\nVoice 2\nKindness is not just something nice you do for someone. Kindness is part of what makes us human. Without it, we would not be able to work together. We would not want to. Henry James was a famous English and American author. He wrote many books that explored the human experience. In 1902, James spoke to a young family member. James told the young man these wise words:\nVoice 6\n“Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind.”\nVoice 1\nDo you think kindness is important in your life? Tell us about one time you were kind. How did it feel? You can email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you work at a hotel. You answer phones and show people to their rooms. You meet a lot of interesting people at your job. And you have seen some strange things.\nVoice 2\nOne day, someone comes into the hotel. They walk up to your desk and tell you they found a wallet outside. It was lying on the sidewalk. They ask if you would return the wallet to its owner. Then, they leave.\nVoice 1\nYou look through the wallet. You are hoping to find something to identify its owner. Instead, you find a key, a list for shopping, and money. The money is worth 100 US dollars. There is a telephone number on the list. You stop for a moment and think. Only one person knows you have the wallet. It would be very easy to take the money. No one is watching.\nPhoto by Andres Siimon on Unsplash\nVoice 2\nWhat would you do? Would you take the money? Would you return the wallet? Would you be honest? Today’s Spotlight is on honesty and why people lie.\nVoice 1\nThis example was part of a real experiment. All over the world, researchers entered hotels. They went to police stations and banks. They turned in wallets. Some wallets had more money, and some had less. The goal was to see when people returned the wallets and why. Researchers dropped over 17,000 wallets in 40 different countries. Then they waited for the results.\nVoice 2\nBefore the study, most researchers believed that people would take the wallets with more money. More money would give people more reason to steal. But this did not happen! Instead, people were more likely to turn in the wallets with more money. This was true in almost every country. More people also returned the wallet if there was a key in it.\nVoice 1\nResearchers believe that there are two reasons for their results. First, people do not want to believe that they are bad. Stealing is illegal in almost every country. When there was more money in the wallet, it felt more like they were stealing. They returned the wallets because they did not want to seem like bad people.\nVoice 2\nDan Ariely is an economist who studies dishonesty. He talked to NPR news. He said that the study showed that people choose to be honest because it is more socially acceptable. He says:\nVoice 3\n“This study shows in a very natural way that our choices about dishonesty are not rational. We do not think in terms of costs and benefits. We think about what we feel comfortable with socially.”\nVoice 1\nThe second reason researchers believe people returned wallets with more money and items is because they felt bad for the owner of the wallet. Everyone knows what it feels like to lose something. You become panicked or distressed. You search and do not stop. This is especially true if you lose something important to you.\nVoice 2\nEmpathy is the ability to understand another person’s experiences. We think about how we might feel if we lost a wallet full of money. This also affects situations where we lie. It is easier to lie when the lie is small or if we think what we do will not change anything. But if we think about how we feel when someone lies, we may not do it. In this way, honesty depends on empathy.\nVoice 1\nHow honest we are also depends on our own needs. A person may be more willing to lie if they need something very badly.\nVoice 2\nHow honest we are also changes when dealing with different people. Stereotypes are beliefs we have about people without really knowing them. These beliefs about groups of people shape our behavior. They make it more difficult to feel empathy. Imagine that you believe that all people from a particular country lie. You may dislike them, even though you do not know much about them. You may be honest toward everyone else. But you may not believe that people from this country deserve honesty. You may not be honest, because you do not believe those people will be honest.\nVoice 1\nBut how honest you are also can also depend on where you are from. David Hugh-Jones is a researcher at The University of East Anglia. In 2015, he decided to study what honesty looked like in different countries. He created an experiment. He asked people from many different countries to report the results of a coin flip. The person in the experiment would throw the coin in the air. If the coin landed on heads, the person would get money. If it landed on tails, they got nothing. Hugh-Jones also had people answer questions about music. Correct answers would also get a reward. People in the study could easily cheat. But the questions were very difficult. Almost no one would know them. So Hugh-Jones would know when they were honest or not.\nICMA Photos, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2\nHugh-Jones found that the U.K. was the most honest in the coin flip. But Japan was the most honest in the music quiz. And other countries had different levels of honesty. The two different tests showed that people were honest about some things, but not honest about other things. This could have to do with cultural differences about honesty.\nVoice 1\nAlmost every culture values honesty. But it is not always easy to be honest. Telling the truth can be difficult. Most of the time, we lie to stay safe. Judi Ketteler is a journalist who reports on honesty. She wrote for Scientific American:\nVoice 4\n“In relationships, we lie to make people feel better or to avoid awkward situations. But we also do not like it when our romantic partner lies to us. We lie to ourselves as well, believing that we are smarter than we are. Children will lie more often if other people have lied to them. We even lie if we are afraid the truth will look like a lie. And of course, we also lie on social media.”\nVoice 2\nThese lies can keep us happy. They help us avoid difficult situations. But lying also causes negative emotions like worry. It can make you think everyone else is lying too. And most of the time, lying is not even necessary. Ketteler says:\nVoice 4\n“We often think being honest will be more difficult than it is. In fact, people find that being honest makes relationships better. It improves social connections more than they expect.”\nVoice 1\nSo, how can you be more honest? Ketteler offers this advice: A good start is to watch when you lie. Why are you not being honest? What will happen if you speak the truth? Try to stop the small lies first. You may find the bigger lies will also stop soon after.\nVoice 2\nHow honest do you think you are? Have you ever tried to be more truthful? What was it like? You can leave a comment on our website.

He wakes up to the sound of pots and pans clanging. His neighbors are using the kitchen early, again. But he does not mind. Time is not the same in Beijing’s underground city, away from the sun. Xi dresses quickly in his small room. It is so small that he must duck down to keep his head low when he stands. He gathers a suitcase full of Buddhist prayer beads. Above the ground, he will sell these beads on a street corner. But now he must begin the long trip to the surface. He ducks through short hallways. He drags the suitcase up cracked stairs. He passes other small rooms like his, full of people. Finally, he reaches a door that opens to the street. Cars rumble past him. It is the first time he has felt fresh air all day.\nPicture of the Dixia Cheng entrance at Xidamochang Jie, Beijing, China, taken on July 13, 2008; By Well-rested at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0\nVoice 2\nAll around Beijing, thousands of doors like this are opening. People like Xi are coming from their underground homes. They come up to clean people’s homes. They come to cook in restaurants. Then, when their jobs are done, they go back to these doors. Together, they disappear underground. It is like they were never there. Sim Chi Yin is an artist and photographer. She followed the lives of some of the people like Xi. She told their stories to the world.\nVoice 1\nTogether, the people of Beijing have a name for these underground people. They are called Shuzu, in English the rat tribe. Today’s Spotlight is on the rat tribe in Beijing.\nVoice 2\nBeijing is one of the largest cities in the world. Over 20 million people live there. It is also the capital of China. It is the country’s cultural center. Because of this, there are many opportunities for work in Beijing. People travel from all over the country to live in Beijing. They move there to follow their dreams.\nVoice 1\nBut many of these people are not wealthy. And housing in the city is extremely expensive. Some people do not have permits to work there. So, they must find homes somewhere else. Many settle in the basements and tunnels of Beijing. They become members of the rat tribe. Rooms underneath the city are very inexpensive. They cost about half as much as the rooms above ground. They are not good rooms. Many are very small. People living there must share toilets and kitchens with many different households.\nVoice 2\nThese rooms were not built for people to live in permanently. Some were not even meant for people. The Government of China built many of these rooms as bunkers in the 1960s. These underground structures are where people would go in case of a bomb attack. For a long time, the government of China feared war. They required most buildings to be built with bunkers beneath them. They even built a huge, public bunker. Local people call this bunker The Underground City. The Underground City was over 85 square kilometers wide!\nExample of an underground bunker; Image by Tomasz Pro from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nBut when war never came, owners of these buildings began to sell space for rooms. The government even allowed people to rent spaces in the Underground City. Some of these rooms were meant for people. But some had to be changed. Places meant for food became places where people could stay. Cold concrete rooms changed into cozy living spaces. More and more people moved to Beijing. There was no room for them. So, they moved into the bunkers. Today, there may be over a million people living underground.\nVoice 2\nThis bunker housing is cheap. But being a member of the rat tribe can be difficult. Living underground can be cramped and depressing. It is difficult to live only by electric light! Liu Hao is working to become a photographer filmmaker. He lives in Beijing’s underground. He told Al Jazeera America:\nVoice 3\n“The first basement I stayed at in Beijing was very large. But it was very humid, with a lot of water in the air. After one month it was still smelly. There was water on the floor from the humidity, and things got moldy. So I moved. Then I found this room. It is about eight square meters for 360 yuan. I have no income, so I live here. It is ok. I do feel uncomfortable here, though. I always feel very tired. Maybe because there is no sunlight here.”\nVoice 1\nMany people of the rat tribe also feel a great shame about living underground. They may not share where they live with their families or friends. Some may like their living situation, but their families object. It can cause tension between family members. Zhang Xi is an immigrant from Mongolia who is a member of the rat tribe. He told Al Jazeera America:\nVoice 4\n“My dad visited me a while ago. When he came, I had no time to clean up beforehand. I know he cried that night he stayed with me. He said, “Son, this will not do. This place is not suitable for living.” But I told him that when I go out, I always look very presentable. Who will know that I live in a basement?”\nVoice 2\nLiving as a member of the rat tribe is also difficult for another reason. In 2012, it became illegal. Chinese authorities now believe that these bunker rooms are not safe. Many do not have fire escapes. If a basement were to flood, many people would die. Members of the rat tribe are willing to take this risk. But the city of Beijing is not. In 2015, they evicted 120,000 people living underground. Every one of them lost their homes. There was nowhere for them to go. So, while there is danger living underground, there is also a danger of having no home at all.\nVoice 1\nStill, most members of the rat tribe do not believe that their situation is permanent. Even if their homes are illegal, they still persist. They plan to save their money, until they can purchase a better house. Some wait until they can get a better job. Living underground is one step on a road that leads to a better life. Zhang Qiuli works in Beijing and lives in a basement apartment. She told the magazine Foreign Affairs:\nVoice 5\n“There is no real difference between us and the people who live above us. We wear the same clothes. Our hairstyles are just as funky. The only difference is that they have more money now. When we can afford it, we will also move upstairs.”\n\nVideo by Creative time Reports – Spotlight does not control this video.\nVoice 2\nAs for Zhang Xi, he continues living in his basement because he has a dream: He wants to be an actor. And he believes the best way to do that is to live in Beijing. Living as a member of the rat tribe is the only way he knows to follow his dream. And he will live in his basement room until he finds his way. In a video from Creative Time Reports he says:\nVoice 4\n“I do this because I have a dream. To say it out loud sounds almost wishful. But I came to Beijing because of a dream. I am like so many young migrants. We are all seeking to succeed here in Beijing. Only we migrants live in basements. Young people like us, why else would they come to Beijing to live in a basement? They definitely do this because they have dreams.”\nVoice 1\nDo you have a dream? What would you do to achieve it?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nIn August 2020, a group of students in Texas, in the United States wanted to change the name of their school. Their school had been named after Robert E. Lee. He was a general in the Confederate Army. This army was one side of the US Civil War in the 1860s. They fought for the right to own slaves. Robert E. Lee also owned slaves.\nVoice 2\nThe group of students did not want to honor this man or his history. So they started a campaign to change the name of their school. They inspired posts and hashtags on social media. The students asked their leaders to take action.\nRobert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, United States.; Larry D. Moore, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1\nSomething similar happened in the state of Alabama. Three schools there were named after Confederate leaders. Groups of students and supporters asked their school boards to change the name of the schools. They told their leaders that it was time to face history. It was time to take action to help fix a problem of hate in their community.\nVoice 2\nToday’s Spotlight program is the seventh in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 1\nHate is powerful enough to damage people and communities. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight we will look at the seventh way to fight hate: Pressure Leaders.\nVoice 2\nGood and effective leaders can do much to fight hate in a community. In fact, the SPLC says that “the fight against hate needs community leaders willing to take an active role.” Community leaders must ACT. They must use their authority to fight against hate. They must be good examples for people to follow.\nVoice 1\nSometimes it is difficult for leaders to act against hate. A leader may fear losing supporters or his job. Or a leader may not have a close relationship with the people she leads. That is why the SPLC encourages people to pressure leaders. People can come together. They can influence and educate their leaders. Leaders can then lead a community to helpful change. So, how can you encourage your leaders to lead a fight against hate? How can you influence them toward change? How can you pressure your leaders?\nVoice 2\nFirst, the SPLC says to form relationships with your community leaders. Leaders and communities who are close can communicate their needs better.\nVoice 1\nSecond, you can educate your community leaders about hate. Help them understand the causes and effects of hate. Leaders may not understand that hate affects every member of a community. Hate is a serious community problem. When good leaders know the facts about hate, they want to stop it quickly.\nVoice 2\nThird, the SPLC says we need to demand that authorities react to a hate-based incident or a hate crime quickly and seriously. It is important that authorities completely investigate hate-based crimes. Local media like newspapers, radio, and television often report on crimes in an area. The media can show people the effects of hate. The media can encourage communities to accept other people no matter who they are or what they believe.\nVoice 1\nFourth, expect leaders to speak against hate-based incidents strongly and publicly when they do happen. Leaders represent large groups of people. When a leader speaks against hate, she influences her listeners. She also influences her listeners when she speaks for tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means to respect every person equally. If a leader does not speak against hate, she is still sending a message. She sends a message that the community accepts hate.\nVoice 2\nFifth, leaders must clearly name the problem. Sometimes it is difficult to speak clearly and openly about hate. Leaders may try to avoid using the word “hate.” Or they may try to forget about the problem. But forgetting about the problem of hate makes victims of hate crimes feel unsupported. A community without honesty becomes divided. It suffers. And it lets hate continue.\nVoice 1\nLastly pressure your leaders when they do not act. Leaders in a community must be involved in the fight against hate. Ask leaders to be involved by speaking at peace events. Ask them to attend community meetings. Ask them to help create long-term ways to solve the problem of hate. Leaders who fight against hate have stronger communities. Victims in their communities feel supported. Whole communities feel safer. And they know how to react to future hate-based incidents.\nVoice 2\nThese are all good ways to pressure your leaders to encourage tolerance. But what happens when a leader makes a racist comment? What happens when elected officials, police, or community leaders encourage hate instead of tolerance?\nVoice 1\nThe SPLC believes that community members have power to encourage, or pressure, leaders in that case too. The SPLC encourages community members to put pressure on hate-filled leaders. They say you can organize a group of people who believe in tolerance. Encourage your group to write letters to the leader. Encourage your group to organize public events. Leaders who encourage hate will damage their communities. Work to educate and communicate with these kinds of leaders in your community. Help them understand that leaders need to be involved in the fight against hate.\nVoice 2\nRemember the students in Texas and Alabama from the beginning of this program? The school board leaders in these places voted to change the names of their schools. Many other schools in the Southern United States are doing the same still today. Marché Johnson was one of the people in the movement in Alabama. She told the SPLC,\nVoice 3\n“We proved through this movement that things can change. Now is the time for conversations and action to happen. It is a healing process – and it starts with this.”\nVoice 1\nThis is the seventh program in a series of ten programs on ten ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nA big group can send a big message. But sometimes that message is not a good one. Instead, it is a message of hate. Sometimes people will gather together against others they think are different. They form hate groups. These hate groups sometimes organize crowds of people. They send out information about their gathering, or rally. They meet at a particular time and place. They may bring signs to carry. These signs tell the message of the hate group. Often, these signs insult another particular group of people.\nVoice 2 \nSometimes these rallies become dangerous. People may come to protest the rally. People in the rally and people protesting the rally may begin to fight. Riots may start. Police may try to keep the peace. They arrest people who are fighting. Often, people fighting suffer injuries. News of the hate rally violence spreads. In the end, more people know about the hate rally.\nVoice 1 \nBut people do want to protest hate rallies. So, how can a person show that he disagrees with hate, or a hate rally? How can a person lead a protest to a hate rally without inciting violence?\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the sixth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate and hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nHate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the sixth way to fight hate: Create an Alternative.\nImage by StockSnap from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nPeople faced with hate rallies may feel helpless against such a large hate-filled group. They may feel anger. People may want to show their anger by physically hurting the hate group or causing trouble for them. People protesting hate may want to shout or throw something at the hate group.\nVoice 1 \nBut violent protests like this do not usually change anything. In fact, protesting a hate group like this can cause more trouble and hate in a community. And violent protests force police to protect everyone at a rally – even the hate group.\nVoice 2 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has a different idea about what people can do when they are faced with a hate rally. They say that “Every act of hatred should be met with an act of love and unity.” That is, people can create a sort of balance. When someone does an act of hate, another person can fight it with an act of love.\nVoice 1 \nYou can do this when you are faced with a hate rally. This is creating an alternative. An alternative is a different thing to choose. For example, one thing you could do is to attend a hate rally to protest it. Or you could choose an alternative. You could choose to protest the hate rally in a different way.\nVoice 2 \nSo, what could you do as an alternative? Well, the Southern Poverty Law Center suggests holding another event. This other event should be in a different place, but at the same time as the hate rally. You could host, or lead, a picnic, a parade, or a celebration of diversity. Celebrate every kind of culture represented in your community. Include as many different cultures in your celebration as you can. Celebrate the different religions in your community. Include food, music, dancing, and information about the many different kinds of people near you.\nPhoto by Kalle Lundin on Unsplash\nVoice 1 \nThis will offer other people an alternative too. They can attend your event instead of the hate rally. This will also take away attention from the hate group. And it will help people value each other and all our differences. One town in Maine, in the United States, experienced this kind of alternative. Here is the story.\nVoice 2 \nIn 2001, Many Somali immigrants came to the town of Lewiston, in the state of Maine. They wanted to improve their quality of life. They did not just want lower cost housing. They wanted good schools. They wanted a smaller community where they could work and raise their children.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2002, a local government official, the mayor of Lewiston, sent the Somali community a letter. He asked them to stop inviting more family to live in Lewiston. He told the group that the town of Lewiston could not deal with any more Somalis. He said that many new immigrants cost a lot of money. Somali community members were shocked at the mayor’s letter. Some of them insulted the mayor. Some Somalis wrote back that they were helping the community, not hurting it.\nVoice 2 \nA hate group also read the mayor’s letter. They saw a chance to spread their message. They planned a hate rally in January 2003. They hoped that people would join their rally against the Somalis.\nVoice 1 \nPeople in the community reacted to the plan for the hate rally. They planned an alternative event. The group planning the new event called themselves the “Many and One Coalition”. They invited local churches, students, and many concerned people to join the event. They used the event to teach people about diversity, or differences in people.\nVoice 2 \nThey hoped their event would send a message against hate. They believed that their message against hate would be stronger than the hate group’s message.\nVoice 1 \nThey were right! More than 4,000 people attended the Many and One Coalition’s diversity event. And fewer than 100 people attended the hate rally.\nPhoto by Nitish Meena on Unsplash\nVoice 2 \nLove is stronger than hate. When people act in love, they can make a community stronger. They can stop hate – together.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the sixth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In April 2017, a man invaded the home of Sarah Halimi. He called her hateful names and attacked her. He threw her from a window. She died after this attack. The man wanted to hurt Halimi because she was Jewish.\nVoice 2 \nIn January 2018, an eight-year-old boy was attacked while walking to tutoring. He was wearing a kind of Jewish hat.\nVoice 1 \nIn recent years, many Jews like Sarah Halimi and this eight-year-old boy in France have been hurt because of who they are. French government officials say that anti-Jewish beliefs are “spreading like poison” there. More and more Jewish people in France are reporting experiencing crime or hateful speech because of who they are.\nVoice 2 \nCrimes done against people because of who they are, are hate crimes. President Emmanuel Macron of France responded to these and other hate crimes. He said:\nVoice 3 \n“Every time a citizen is attacked because of their age, their appearance, or their religion, it is an attack on the whole country.”\nEmmanuel Macron, President of France; “Emmanuel Macron” (CC BY 2.0) by paquierjacques\nVoice 1 \nWhy do hate crimes like these happen? How can France, and other countries, deal with them? Today’s Spotlight program is the fifth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the fifth way to fight hate in your community: Educate Yourself.\nVoice 1 \nHow can a community understand people who do hate crimes? How can they react to such violence and hate? The SPLC says that researching the facts about hate groups and hate crimes can be one answer. They call this educating yourself. When people have the facts about a hate group, they can fight hate. Communities must know about hate groups and hate crime before they can react to them and stop them. But knowledge can also help people stop hating. Hate usually comes from fear. And understanding can defeat fear.\nPhoto by mentatdgt from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nA hate crime often starts with a bias. A bias is an opinion about someone who is different from you. A person often makes a bias because he does not understand people from another group. Often, we do not know people who belong to different religious or racial groups than ourselves. If we have never met someone from that group, we can easily form wrong opinions about them. These biases might be negative. Sometimes they encourage prejudices and hate.\nVoice 1 \nEvery person has biases. Often, people do not even know their own biases. But they express biases in many forms. A person can express his bias in words or actions. The SPLC calls some incidents “bias incidents.” For example, a racial joke is a bias incident. Bias incidents do not involve criminal acts like beatings, starting fires, or damaging property.\nVoice 2 \nHate groups try to use and encourage the biases people already feel. In fact, hate groups are usually very skilled at spreading their biases. They use propaganda. Propaganda is bias information that people use to spread a particular message. These hateful messages can appear as a painting on the side of a building, on a paper hanging in a local store, or even sometimes on television or the radio.\nVoice 1 \nHate propaganda influences how people think of each other. It tries to represent groups of people as less than human. Slowly, members of a community begin to think that a particular group of people is not important or is harmful. Angry, scared individuals may attack the minority group. These criminals believe that their actions are accepted. They may even believe that they are doing good work.\nVoice 2 \nThe SPLC says that most hate crimes are not committed by hate groups. They are committed by individuals, alone or in small groups. These individuals have listened to hate propaganda. They let their biases influence bad actions. These criminal actions are hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nAny criminal act done against someone because of a bias is a hate crime. Attacking someone because of their religion, race, sexual history, sex, or disability is wrong. It is a hate crime. Many areas punish hate crimes severely. But how do we stop hate crimes from happening?\nVoice 2 \nFirst, it is important to try and understand your own biases. What do you know about people who are different to you? The first step is to learn about people who are different to you. Try to understand them. Learn about them. When we understand and listen to each other, we learn to accept our differences. Continue investigating your own biases.\nVoice 1 \nSecond, if you observe or experience a hate crime, try to find out if a hate group was involved. You can also research facts about the particular hate group you are trying to stop. What does the group want? What signs or symbols represent the group?\nVoice 2 \nExperts say that members of hate groups often want to divide communities. They want to separate a community into racial, ethnic or religious groups. They may want to give particular groups in the community limited rights. Many do not respect or recognize the authority of the government. And they try to harm people who oppose them and their ideas.\nVoice 1 \nWhen you know about the hate groups in your area, you are more prepared to fight against the hate they represent. If you have children, talk to them about how they should react to hate. Share information you have learned with your community.\nImage by truthseeker08 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nInformation and education are powerful. When people have the facts, they can make better decisions. When people learn about other cultures, they do not feel threatened by them. Education helps people to understand the world and other people better.\nVoice 1 \nHate and hate crimes cannot continue. Whole communities must join the fight against hate. We can all encourage tolerance and acceptance in our communities.\nVoice 2 \nThis is the fifth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a website that tracks and reports on hate groups, especially in the Southern United States.

This park is in California in the United States. Dupuy was enjoying the park with her friends. But a man walked over to her. He asked where she was from. Dupuy grew up in the United States. But her ancestors were from Korea. She told the man she was Korean. Then he began making bad comments to her. After a short time, he began attacking her. She told the Triton Times:\nVoice 3 \n“He made comments to me and many other people and no one stopped him. He threatened me with physical violence. No one stopped him. I protected myself and he still was able to attack me. People only helped me after I got hurt.”\nVoice 2 \nThe man broke Dupuy’s shoulder and gave her a concussion — a serious injury to her head. Leticia Clark is the Mayor of Tustin, where this incident happened. She said in a statement:\nVoice 4 \n“I want to send a clear message. Tustin has zero tolerance for bigotry or racism. I am very disturbed by the rise in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans. As a community, we cannot be silent about these crimes. If we witness acts of hate and discrimination, we must speak out, stand up and stop it.”\nRally to stop Asian hate, McPherson Square, D.C. 3/21/21; “Stop Asian Hate” (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) by vpickering\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the fourth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate. On today’s Spotlight we look at the fourth way to fight hate in your community: Speak Up.\nVoice 1 \nThe fast rise in anti-Asian hate began in 2020. In March of 2020, the President of the United States made a tweet. In that tweet, he called covid-19 “the China virus”. He continued to call this virus by this name instead of covid-19.\nVoice 2 \nHateful words from leaders have real consequences. Studies have shown that words like this caused the rise in anti-Asian hate and attacks on Asian people in the US. The group Stop AAPI Hate records hate incidents against Asian Americans. In 2020, there were more than 3,700 attacks on Asian people. But in March 2021, that number had increased to over 6,600.\nVoice 1 \nBut people like Jenna Dupuy are bravely speaking up. In May of 2021, Dupuy was a speaker at a Youth Against Hate rally. At this rally, youth from different groups gathered together to speak out against hate.\nVoice 2 \nSeveral youth organizations planned the rally. The SPLC believes that anyone can fight hate by speaking up like these students did. People can make posts on social media. They can make pamphlets or fliers. They can email local news stations. You can spread tolerance by speaking up. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means respecting every person equally.\nVoice 1 \nIt is easy to stay quiet in a difficult situation. No one wants to be a target of violence or hate. And it is difficult to speak up when it seems everyone else has a different opinion. But there are many different ways to speak up.\nA teacher and students; Photo by Katerina Holmes from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nThe website learningforjustice.org has produced a guide for teachers who want to stop hate. But these are good tips for any person. They say one way to speak up is to prepare yourself and practice. Remind yourself that you are a person who speaks up against hate. Believe it. This simple exercise can change your mind from doing nothing to taking action.\nVoice 1 \nThe next step is to memorize some simple phrases. These phrases will work for different situations. For example, when you hear a hateful joke, you can say something like “I do not find that funny”, or “that offends me”, or “I am surprised to hear you say that”. These phrases can help begin a conversation about stopping hate.\nVoice 2 \nYou can also interrupt hate by asking questions. Some simple questions are: “What do you mean by that?” “Why would you say something like that?” “What point are you trying to make by saying that?” Questions make the person who said the hateful thing have to think about their answer. They may not understand that the thing they said was racist. They may not even be able to explain why they said it. Speaking up can help people examine their part in stopping hate.\nVoice 1 \nYou can also speak up by learning. Information can encourage tolerance. You can research facts about the effects of hate on a community. We will talk about how to educate yourself in the next program.\nVoice 2 \nYou can spread this or any information about tolerance at your school, the place where you worship, or on a website. You can bring information to the people who live near you. Offer to talk with them about tolerance and hate.\nVoice 1 \nAnyone of any age can fight hate. 626 Speak Out is a youth organization. They want to encourage young people to become activists. They want young people to learn about and speak up against tough issues. Jayden Chow is in high school. He is an outreach leader for 626 Speak Out. He told his high school newspaper:\nVoice 5 \n“You have a voice for a reason. And if you have that voice, you should be able to use it for good. And especially in our modern day, you should use your voice to help others. It is especially important to educate yourself. That is not only for school, but socially as well. You need to be aware of what is happening to other people, not only those around you maybe, but everywhere in the world.”\nHands in a circle together; Photo by Mikael Blomkvist from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nSpeak up. Help your community to see hate for what it really is. (Speak up.) Encourage your local radio and television news stations to report hate incidents and peace rallies correctly and fairly. (Speak up.) Write to your local newspapers and magazines. Encourage them to look closely at efforts to fight hate. (Speak up.) You have the power to change your community. Speak up!\nVoice 1 \nThis is the fourth program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn April 2019, Natasha Badhwar was preparing for a trip. She was going to visit a few small villages in northeastern India with a team of people called the Karwan-e-Mohabbat. In English this means “Caravan of Love”.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nKarwan-e-Mohabbat is a group that supports victims of hate crimes and other injustice. Since 2017, this group travels all around India. They meet with victims of hate crimes. They give legal and social help. On their website, Karwan-e-Mohabbat says that many places they go they meet minorities living in fear. These minorities often accept that hate and violence are a normal part of life for them. And many people in the majority community do not seem to care. What was Badhwar going to do there? Why would she travel with this group?\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the third in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center has made a list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. On today’s Spotlight program we will look at the third way to fight hate in your community: Support the Victims.\nSikkim is a northeastern state of India, north of West Bengal, east of Nepal; Photo by Anja Disseldorp, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nNatasha Badhwar wrote about her experience on Mint, a news website in India. During her trip, Badhwar met a mother named Manju Devi. Her son had been killed. In her community, it was not permitted for people to fall in love with someone who was not Hindu. People had killed Devi’s son because they thought he was in love with a Muslim girl.\nVoice 2 \nAfter this attack, there was more violence. Four other Muslim men were killed. Shabnam Khatoon survived this violence. Khatoon said that he did not want revenge for his friends who had been killed. He told Badhwar:\nVoice 3 \n“We want justice. We want peace. Do we not deserve to rebuild our broken lives?”\nVoice 1 \nOne of the other members of Badhwar’s group was Mohammad Aamir Khan. He had spent 14 years in prison for a crime he had not done. He spent time locked away alone in solitary confinement. Guards beat him. He had lost his parents. He did not deserve what had happened to him. It was difficult. But he refused to be defeated.\nImage by Ichigo121212 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nKhan encouraged the victims of hate crimes they met on their trip. After he had been mistreated, he found hope. He had found a greater vision. He told these people not to see themselves as victims who are alone. Instead, he said they should give their support to others who were also hurting. He told them many others do not deserve their hurt.\nVoice 1 \nBadhwar was discouraged by the injustices that she saw on her trip. But she did not give up. She says:\nVoice 4 \n“The healthiest response to frightening or overwhelming information is action. We can step out to face violence and hate. When we do this, we also discover the power and grace of those who stand up to it. We find the strength we were afraid we did not have.”\nVoice 2 \nHate crimes happen in every country in the world. People attack other people because of the color of their skin, their religious beliefs, their sexual preferences, their abilities, or just because they are different. A person is attacked just because of who they are.\nVoice 1 \nThe victims of hate crimes might feel alone and afraid. Sometimes, the victim of a hate crime will refuse to report the hate crime. He may be afraid that he will suffer again. Or he is afraid that the authorities will not help him.\nVoice 2 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center believes that one way to fight hate is to support the victims of hate crimes and hate-based incidents. When a victim feels supported, he is more likely to report a hate-based incident or hate crime. And when victims report hate crimes, communities can do better at preventing future hate crimes.\nVoice 1 \nVictims of hate crimes may feel as if they have no value in a community. So, the people of a community must show that they do value every member of the community.\nVoice 2 \nYou can do many things to support victims of hate crime. The SPLC says that even small and simple acts of kindness can make a victim feel as if he has value. A letter, a visit, or a telephone call can show your support and love for a victim of a hate crime. This is what Natasha Badhwar was trying to do. Listening to and being with people who are victims shows that they are valued.\nVoice 1 \nIf a hate crime has damaged a person’s property, you can offer to help fix the damage. You could ask other members of the community to help. Help to paint over harmful words. Help to clean up broken glass.\nImage by John Hain from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nWhen communities support victims, they help to stop hate. They send a message to hate criminals that they will not accept hate.\nVoice 1 \nIf you are a victim of hate, you should not suffer in silence. The SPLC urges you to report your incident to the police. Often, unpunished violence escalates. It grows and gets worse. If it is reported, this can stop the violence before it escalates. You can also report your incident to the local newspaper. If you see a hate crime, you can also report it. Victims should not be the only people speaking out against hate.\nVoice 2 \nFinally, the SPLC encourages people to research their legal rights. Many countries have laws against hate crimes. People who do hate crimes are criminals. The law can punish them.\nVoice 1 \nThe fight against hate includes all people. Every person can do something. It is important to act against hate. It is important to join forces against hate. And it is important to support the innocent victims of hate.\nVoice 2 \nThis is the third program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn March of 2018, many people in London, England, received some troubling letters. People in other communities, like Birmingham, and Leicester, got these letters too. These letters were encouraging people to take part in an event. This event was called “Punish a Muslim Day”. The letter told people to do acts of violence against Muslims. The person who wrote the letters wanted to get lots of people to join.\n\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThe Muslim community in England was very upset by these letters. Tell MAMA is a group based in England. They support victims of anti-Muslim hate. Iman Atta was the director of Tell MAMA. She told Sky News,\nVoice 3 \n“This has caused quite a lot of fear within the community. People are asking if they are safe. They are asking if their children are safe to play outdoors.”\nVoice 1 \nThese letters made people afraid. It was probably easier to not talk about them. In many situations people do not talk about hate crimes. But there are ways to fight hate.\nImage by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the second in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we look at ten ways to fight hate.\nVoice 1 \nHate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. Today’s Spotlight is on the second way to fight hate in your community: Join Forces.\nVoice 2 \nManzoor Ali was a resident of Manchester and a Muslim. He owned a cafe in Manchester, England. When he heard of these letters, he was hurt. He decided to do something. His family planned a different day. The day they planned was called “Banish Hate Day.” On this day, he encouraged people to be kind. His shop gave away free tea, cake and other treats. Ali told The Manchester Evening News:\nVoice 4 \n“We will not let small-minded people set us against each other. Instead, our arms and doors are open – even to those minds that incite hate. Get to know us, and our community. Join us in our community work. Use that negative energy to do good.”\nVoice 1 \nShahab Adris heard of these letters too. He wrote another letter. But this letter encouraged people to participate in “Love a Muslim Day.” He encouraged people to support Muslims instead of hurting them. He suggested that people could take Muslim friends to get coffee. Or invite a Muslim friend over to hang out.\nA response. Happy Mothers Day everyone!#LoveaMuslimDay #UnityinDiversity pic.twitter.com/rN7VF6m8BU— RJ Shahab Ud'deen (@5haha8) March 11, 2018 \nVoice 2 \nMuslims and non-Muslims responded to his letter. They said they would join. They created community events where people could come together and celebrate “Love a Muslim Day.” Adris told the Huffington Post:\nVoice 5 \n“In the face of extreme hatred, it is important to stay positive. And show some creativity. We must rise above it. We must be active and show compassion and love to our fellow citizens.”\nVoice 1 \nSometimes bringing people together is a difficult job. People who experience hate often feel afraid or alone. People who want to fight against hate may not know how to start. The Southern Poverty Law Center says that people should always remember one thing. People around you also want to stop hate. That is why it is so important to unite and join forces.\n\nSee the Advanced version of this program\nVoice 2 \nEveryone knows that there is power in numbers. Many people have a louder voice than only one person. More people can do more things. They can educate more people. Criminals may also be less likely to attack a larger group of people. And more people also means more ideas! Every person can add something. So how can you join forces? How can you find people to connect to?\nVoice 1 \nThe SPLC says that there are many ways to join forces with other people. You can start by joining with people who you are already close to. Gather with your friends and family. Ask the people who live near you, your neighbours, to join your group against hate. Invite the people you work or worship with.\nVoice 2 \nRemember also to join with people who are different to you. Uniting can bring together every person of a community. When you see hate, encourage your group to act against it. Meet together and talk about ways to make your group grow. Talk about ways to educate your community about people who are different.\nVoice 1 \nYou can also work with larger groups in your community. What groups in your community might want to stop hate? The SPLC suggests inviting and involving women’s groups, teachers, labour unions, university workers, and young people groups. Involve schools, businesses, places of worship, children, members of minority groups and politicians. They also encourage people to involve local police. Police can watch for early signs of hate in a community.\nVoice 2 \nThat is what people in London did when those letters arrived. These letters encouraged people to hurt each other. They wanted to divide people. But the people in these communities did not divide. The police departments encouraged people to turn in the letters if they received them. The police went out to find who sent the letters. Angela Williams, from the West Yorkshire police, told these communities:\nVoice 6 \n“Our communities should be careful. But do not be frightened. We are stronger when we stand together as one and will not be divided.”\nVoice 1 \nAnd the community did stand together. In response, people like Manzoor Ali and Shahab Adris joined forces. Some people posted on social media. They made a hashtag: #WeStandTogether. They volunteered to walk people home from work or school. Some people made leaflets and online posts about what to do if you see a hate crime.\nImage by Martin Foskett from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nSadly, hate exists in every community. But there are many ways that people can stand up and join forces against it. Remember that you are not alone.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the second program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nOn August 12, 2018, Hawk Newsome was visiting Washington DC, in the United States. He was walking with a crowd of people. They were all a part of an eight-day march. This peaceful protest was called the Agape March.\nVoice 2 \nAgape is a Greek word that means “love”. But agape is not just any kind of love. This love means that we give of ourselves for others. When we practice agape love, we are seeking the best for another person — even through our own sacrifice. The goal of the Agape March was to spread love. This kind of love is the opposite of hate.\nVia Instagram\nVoice 1 \nToday’s Spotlight program is the first in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at 10 ways to fight hate.\nVoice 2 \nHate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. Hate can lead people to do horrible things, like hate crimes. A person commits a hate crime because he hates that the other person is different. Hate crimes can take many different forms. Hate crimes may be violent. Or they may be non-violent. But they are very damaging to people and communities. They always are meant to scare or hurt other people.\nVoice 1 \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of 10 ways to fight hate in your community. In today’s program we will look at the first way to fight hate in your community: Act.\nVoice 2 \nHawk Newsome wanted to act because of what he had seen a year before. One year before, in Charlottesville, Virginia, a hate group formed rallies and shouted hateful words. Violence broke out between the hate group and protesters. During the violence, a man drove his car into the protestors. He killed a woman and injured 19 more people. This incident affected Newsome. This is why he began the Agape March. He told Newsweek,\nVoice 3 \n“I was in Charlottesville last year. I saw the tear gas, the rocks, and the guns. I saw the power of hate. What I want to see now is the power of love.”\nAlt-right members carry Nazi and Confederate Flags in Charlottesville hate rally; “Charlottesville ”Unite the Right” Rally” (CC BY 2.0) by Anthony Cride\nVoice 1 \nHate crime happens in many places around the world. Maybe you have seen or experienced a hate crime for yourself. People who observe or experience hate crimes often feel helpless or alone. But it is important to remember that you do have the power to stop hate. You are not alone. Many people in your community also want to stop hate.\nVoice 2 \nImagine if you read about the violence in Charlottesville. What would you have done? The Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, says that when you observe a hate crime you could react in two different ways. First, you could do nothing. You could continue living your life as you are. Or you could react in a completely different way. You could do something. They suggest that you “rise up, speak up and stand up against hate.” People must act out against hate crimes. Hate will continue if people do not act.\nVoice 1 \nPeople who commit crimes because of hate are not only attacking one person or group. The hate crime in Charlottesville influenced the whole community. Hate tears communities apart. When communities are in conflict, all members of the community suffer. Experts say that hate crimes encourage community conflict and riots more than any other crimes.\nVoice 2 \nSo, the SPLC suggests that people should react to hate crimes by doing good things. In one city in West Virginia, vandals wrote words of hate on the outside wall of a building. A teacher at a school nearby discussed this act of vandalism with his students. The children wanted to fight this form of hate crime. They decided to paint over the hateful words. The vandals sent a message of hate. But the students sent another message. They sent a message saying that they did not want hate in their community.\nVoice 1 \nPeople who commit hate crimes can see if people do not react. The students reacted. The criminals could see that the community did not agree with their words of hate.\nPhoto by Alice Donovan Rouse from StockSnap\nVoice 2 \nWhat can you do to fight hate in your community? That is not an easy question. But there are many things to try. You can lead a prayer, paint over vandalism, or speak in your place of worship, or school. You can work with others to lead a meeting in your community and think of ideas to stop hate crimes. You can organize a rally. Gather many people together to protest hate. If you are an artist, offer to make materials to inform other people about the anti -hate rallies. If you play an instrument offer to perform at a concert to raise money to fight hate.\nVoice 1 \nHawk Newsome saw the power of hate. He was sad and angry because of the injustice he had seen. He believed that a change was necessary. Otherwise, more violence like the kind people saw in Charlottesville would happen again. He wanted to make a difference. So he worked with other people to make the Agape March. He told Newsweek:\nClick here to listen to the Advanced version of this program.\nVoice 3 \n“This march is an exercise of love. A revolutionary love. With it, we seek to truly change America.”\nVoice 2 \nHate separates a community – but you can help bring it back together. As the SPLC says: “In the face of hate, silence is deadly.” We cannot stay still and silent when hate is around us. We must act.\nVoice 1 \nThis is the first program in a series of 10 programs on 10 ways to fight hate. This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nToday, social media websites are a huge part of many people’s lives. The website Facebook is only 10 years old. Yet more than 1 billion people use it! Websites like Facebook help people connect with each other, even when they live far away from each other. Social media websites can spread information very quickly. And most importantly, they are not limited by national borders. Using social media, citizens from different countries can communicate with each other. They can share ideas, learn about each other and become friends – even when they are supposed to be enemies. Today’s Spotlight is on a social media movement that encourages friendship and peace between the citizens of two political enemies.\n\nFollow Along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nFor many years, the countries of Israel and Iran have had difficult political relations. News of disagreement and hostile words between these enemies is no surprise. But in 2012, relations between Israel and Iran got especially tense. News media and political leaders were talking about nuclear war. But many ordinary citizens, on both sides, did not want war.\nVoice 1 \nRonny Edry was one of these people. Edry is an Israeli citizen. And he wanted to communicate a different message. Edry is a graphic designer. He uses computers to design and create images. On March 14th, 2012, he created a picture with a message. In the picture, Edry was holding his young daughter. And his young daughter was holding the flag of Israel. The words on the picture said, “Iranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.” Edry put the picture on his Facebook website. The very next day, hundreds of people were talking about his picture on Facebook.\nVoice 2 \nEdry was surprised that even people from Iran were commenting on the picture. In a TED Talks speech, Edry explained,\nVoice 3 \n“In Israel, we do not talk with people from Iran. We do not know people from Iran. On Facebook you are only friends with your neighbours and friends.”\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nBut in just one day, Edry was communicating on Facebook with people from Iran. He was talking with people who were supposed to be his enemies. One young woman from Iran told Edry that she asked her whole family to come to her house to look at his picture. She said that they all sat together looking at her computer. And they were all crying. Edry could not believe it. He was shocked and emotionally touched by this response to his picture.\nVoice 2 \nBut Edry’s one picture was the beginning of something much bigger. Soon, hundreds of people began sending Edry pictures of themselves. They asked him to add the message from his image to their pictures. Edry received so many requests that he had to ask other graphic designers to help him. Israeli citizens from all over began posting pictures on Facebook with the same words: “Iranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.”\nVoice 1 \nBut Israelis were not the only ones to join Edry. Iranians also began to post pictures of their own. Graphic designers from Iran made many pictures that said, “We love you too” and “My Israeli friends: I do not hate you. I do not want war.” Suddenly, thousands of Israeli and Iranian citizens were communicating messages of love and peace to one another. This new community created two Facebook websites – one called “Israel loves Iran” and another called “Iran loves Israel.” In his TED Talk, Edry said,\nVoice 3 \n“It is a story that goes two ways. It is Israelis and Iranians sending the same message one to the other. This has never happened before. These are two people who are supposed to be enemies, close to war, and suddenly, people on Facebook are saying, “I like this person. I love these people. It became very big.”\nVoice 2 \nThe idea spread, and the movement for peace grew. In one week, 2 million people around the world visited the “Israel loves Iran” Facebook website. And people in other countries began creating their own Facebook websites in support. Edry talked with the Christian Science Monitor news organization about the purpose of the movement. He said,\nVoice 3 \n“We are surrounded with images all of the time. The idea we have of the other side is made of images … Most of the time it is going to be bad images. These are the images you get from the news, from television every day. So the idea is to create new images.”\nRonny Edry, via the Peace Factory\nVoice 1 \nBut how much power do these new images have? Can they truly change things? It is easy to put an image on Facebook of someone holding a heart that says “I love Iran.” But does it have the same power as a news media image of world leaders signing a peace agreement? Edry believes his pictures do have great power. He believes that such pictures force people to see their enemies as human beings. And when this happens, it is much harder to want to kill them.\nVoice 2 \nIt has been over two years since Edry put that first “Israel Loves Iran” picture on Facebook. Since that time, Israel and Iran have not signed any peace agreements. Nor have they made any major changes in their policies. But hundreds of thousands of their citizens are connecting with each other in new ways through social media. And millions of people from around the world have visited the Facebook sites – liking and commenting on pictures, putting up their own pictures, and sharing their messages of peace.\nVoice 1 \nOne of the earliest messages written on the “Israel Loves Iran” Facebook page has been shared, liked and reposted again and again. It reads:\nVoice 3 \n“To all the fathers, mothers, children, brothers and sisters: For there to be a war between us, first we must be afraid of each other, we must hate. I am not afraid of you, I do not hate you.”\nVia the Peace Factory\nVoice 2 \nAnd this has been the message of the movement ever since. In his TED Talk, Edry encouraged all people to be part of the solution against war. He said,\nVoice 3 \n“I know how the situation on the ground can look bad. For me, the courageous thing to do is to try to reach the other side before it is too late. Maybe by making an effort, we can avoid war. We can be our own ambassadors.”\nVoice 1 \nDo you think normal citizens can be ambassadors for peace? Can social media movements help avoid war? Tell us what you think.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nYou are on a train in Norway. The train will soon begin moving. You look out the front window. A mountain rises to your left. The sun shines brightly into your eyes. People standing next to the train wave excitedly. You begin to speed up. On the platform outside, you see a small boy with a warm hat on his head. He sits on his father’s shoulders to watch the train better.\nNRK2 via YouTube\nVoice 2\nTracks for other trains cross the path in front of you. Now a red passenger train goes by in the opposite direction. A rock wall appears on your left. Leaves that have already changed to their fall colors are growing from between the rocks.\nVoice 1\nSoon you come to a quiet country village. There are white and yellow houses on both sides. In front of you is a small, dark opening in the base of a mountain. It grows larger and darker by the second as your train speeds toward it. Your train is about to go underground! Now everything in front of you is black as night. The darkness is all you can see for the next four minutes. Then a little spot of light appears. That light tells you that you have reached the other side of the mountain. Soon you will see the sun again.\nVoice 2\nThis describes the first seven minutes of a seven-hour train ride across the country of Norway. This long train ride was recorded on video from beginning to end. It is the first popular example of Slow TV.\nVoice 1\nSlow TV is a completely different form of television. In its most basic form, a person sets up a camera on a usually dull or normal activity — like riding a train. Sometimes the camera does not even move. Producers do not write a script. They do not make the video go faster or cut parts out. A person watching the video experiences the event in real time.\nVoice 2\nThe Slow TV train ride video was broadcast on public television in Norway in 2009. Public television in Norway is well-supported. The producers did not have to worry about how much money they could make through this program. They decided the idea was creative. And they were interested to see how people would react.\nVoice 1\nThe train ride was shown on TV on a Friday night. The producers expected that a few thousand people would watch the program. But information about the program spread quickly. That night more than a million people watched this slow train ride. This means more than three times as many people as usual watched TV that night. In fact, people enjoyed the recording so much that they wanted to see more like it. And they wanted the broadcast to stretch on for an even longer amount of time.\nVoice 2\nThe producers were surprised and excited. Their next Slow TV experiment was a boat trip along the coast of Norway. They recorded for five and a half days. All the video was broadcast live on public television. But about two days into the boat trip, something new began to happen. People began to visit the coast to be in the video. Thomas Hellum was one of the producers of the video. He told NPR:\nVoice 3\n“More and more people singing, playing instruments, people along the coast and thousands of people showed up at every port, every mountain. They could go find the information and see, when will the boat be in my place? And they could prepare.”\nNRK2 via tv.nrk.no\nSee the whole boat ride here\nVoice 1\nThe video showed people waving flags and holding up signs. Small boats sailed next to the large ship. The Queen of Norway waved to the camera from her own boat. Near the end of the trip, the many colors of a rainbow appeared above a green mountain. While the rainbow hung in the sky, this program broke a record. It was the largest number of people ever to watch a program in Norway at the same time.\nVoice 2\nPeople in Norway continue to enjoy Slow TV. Producers have recorded many different long events. They have recorded meat production, making a coat, and fishing in a stream. And the idea has spread to other countries as well. People have made simple slow TV programs all around the world. However, Norway is the only country where the programs are popular on a national level.\nVoice 1\nBut is there anything for the average person to gain from Slow TV? With hundreds of normal programs to choose from, should you give Slow TV a try? There are several different ways that Slow TV can be of value.\nVoice 2\nFirst, it is important to understand that not all people watch Slow TV in the same way. Even in Norway, only some people sit to watch a single program for hours on end. Many people think of the programs like having a pleasant friend in the room. They turn on the TV to a slow program. Then they continue with their work while the show plays next to them. Calming sounds and beautiful things to look at can be especially nice during lonely times.\nVoice 1\nAnother way that people from around the world enjoy Slow TV is as a sort of virtual travel. Maybe they do not have enough money for travel. Or maybe health worries are keeping them home. Watching Slow TV lets people experience other countries. They see through the eyes of someone else walking a street or riding on a train. As they watch the program, they can also read more about the place they are visiting. The place comes alive in their imagination.\nVoice 2\nFinally, Slow TV can calm the mind. Most television programs speed up faster and faster. They follow simple plot lines with clear stories that are told quickly. Slow TV invites people to take the time to notice the details for themselves. No producer has decided what parts of the story are important. Everything stays in the recording. And just like in life, the person watching gets to decide which parts of the story are worth noticing and wondering about.\nImage by weareaway from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nSlow TV may never be as popular around the world as it is in Norway.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3\n“We are all under the same moon.”\nVoice 1\nThese are the words of film director, Kevin Macdonald. What do you think he meant when he said them?\nVoice 2\nMacdonald said these words to the Telegraph news organization. And he was talking about a film he recently directed. A film called “Life in a Day.” Macdonald worked on this film with the famous film producer Ridley Scott. Together, they created this film about life around the world. However, they did not record it themselves. Instead, they used short films or videos recorded by people all over the world.\nVoice 1\nLife in a Day is a film recorded by people like you. It shows the many differences between people and cultures. However, it also shows that there are things that connect all people – like the fact that we all live under the same moon. Today’s Spotlight is on the film Life in a Day.\nVoice 2\nOn July 1st, 2010, Kevin Macdonald released a video on the Internet. He used the popular video sharing website YouTube. Macdonald asked YouTube users to create a video of their life. And he asked everyone to do this on one particular day – July 24th, 2010.\nVoice 1\nIn his message, Macdonald asked YouTube users to film all parts of life. He wanted to see both normal and not normal life. He asked users to answer questions like “What do you love?” “What do you fear?” “What makes you laugh?” and “What do you carry with you?”\nImage by Free-Photos from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nMacdonald asked users to put their finished videos on YouTube. From these shared videos, Macdonald wanted to make one long film about global life. However, this is an unusual way to make a film. It uses a method called “crowd-sourcing.” Crowd-sourcing is when a large group of people help complete a project usually done by a few paid workers. In crowd-sourcing, the group completes the project for less money or even for free. Usually, there is a public announcement for a crowd-sourced project. And often people use the Internet to send in their work.\nVoice 1\nCrowd-sourcing can be helpful in completing many kinds of projects. For example, companies have used crowd-sourcing to find just the right picture for a particular project. Other people have used crowd-sourcing to find the answer to difficult science problems. In recent years, crowd-sourcing has become more and more popular. Now, Kevin Macdonald has made the first ever crowd-sourced film produced in Hollywood.\nVoice 2\nAt first, Macdonald did not believe the project would be very popular. However, people sent over 80,000 videos! And they sent them from over 190 countries. This made Macdonald and producer Ridley Scott believe that their idea could work.\nVoice 1\nMacdonald and Scott paid 25 people to sort all the videos. These people spent months watching all 4,500 hours of film. Then Macdonald and Scott chose the best pieces of video. From these, they created the 95 minute film Life in a Day.\nVoice 2\nLife in a Day began playing in theatres during the summer of 2011. The film includes great stories of birth and love. It also includes terrible stories of fear and death. One of the main stories from the film is about Okhwan Yoon. Yoon is a Korean man. He travels around the world on a bicycle. He rides this two-wheeled vehicle from country to country. His purpose is to teach peace, patience and discovery. He does this by meeting the local people. He talks with them about kindness. Yoon believes that understanding people is the first step of showing kindness. He has travelled to 191 countries to understand people everywhere.\nImage by Quang Nguyen vinh from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nAnother emotional part of the film shows a Japanese father and his young son, Taiji. They are in their apartment. This living space is dirty and not organized. There are many clothes on the floor. The boy quietly watches television. His father performs the morning work. Then they walk over to a large picture of a woman. The father lights a candle. The father and son honour the woman in picture. It is the man’s wife and the boy’s mother. And they are showing respect to her because she has died.\nVoice 2\nThe film’s producers wanted the film to show life from all parts of the world. So, they sent 400 cameras to people living in places with little or no Internet connection. And these cameras produced some of the most beautiful parts of the film.\nVoice 1\nOne example is the story of a boy named Cain Able. Cain lives in Peru. And he is about 10 years old. Cain is friendly. And he works shining shoes. He does this because, like Taiji, his mother is dead. However, Cain is joyful. His smile makes everyone’s day better. It brings joy to the people he meets in the film. It also brings joy to the people watching the film.\nImage by Jamie Norman from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nLife in a Day is interesting because of its method and its message. When people watch it, they will see their own lives. They will also see what life is like for people who are not like them. But most importantly, they will see what is common to all people. As Macdonald told the Telegraph news organization,\nVoice 3\n“This is what people chose to film. Those of us in the news and film industries think we know what films should be about. But most people are interested in a few, simple things – family, children, love, not being alone, not wanting to live through a war, feeling frightened of illness and death. That is it – that is what life is.”\nVoice 1\nWhat do you think about the idea of crowd-sourcing? Do you think it can make a great film? What would you put in a video about your life in a day? Tell us what you think. You can email us at radio@radioenglish.net. Or, you can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nThe children laugh and shout loudly. They are playing games in the playground. One child is “it”. He runs after a group of other children. He catches one of them. That second child becomes ‘it’. She now chases the other children and tries to catch one. They are all playing a game of chase or tag.\nVoice 2 \nIn another area of the playground, two children each hold opposite ends of a long rope. They turn it round and round and up and down. Other children take turns to jump over the rope as it is being turned. They are skipping. And all the children who are skipping are also singing special skipping songs.\nVoice 1 \nChildren in all parts of the world play similar games. Many generations of children have enjoyed playing these traditional games. But could these games have a more important purpose? Today’s Spotlight is on traditional children’s playground games.\nVoice 2  \nExperts everywhere agree that play is good for children. They say it is important for a child’s mental and physical development. Nicola Butler from the organisation Play England told the Huffington Post,\nVoice 3 \n‘Traditional playground games are necessary for children’s health, wellbeing and development. Playing these games lets children learn about friendships. They learn about arguing, making up, negotiating and resolving disputes, and making the game fun and fair. But most importantly being involved in these games make children happy.’\nVoice 1 \nDid you know that children from many countries play the same or similar traditional games? Though, these games often have different names in different countries. The game of leapfrog has been played in the United Kingdom since the 16th century. In this game, one child bends down and holds his knees or ankles. Another child runs up to the first child, places her hands on the back of the first child, and leaps or jumps over the first child. Any number of children can play the game. They all take turns to leap, or jump, like a frog. In other countries children jump like a different animal. In France children call this same game ‘sauté-mouton’ which means ‘leap sheep’. In India they call it ‘Aar Ghodi Ki Par Ghodi’ which means ‘leap horse’.\nVoice 2 \nAnother game children play all over the world is hopscotch. In Albania they call the game varra. In Germany it is hinkspiel. Yohanes Lie told TOPICS Online magazine what the game is called in his country,\nVoice 4 \n‘When I was a child, my friends and I used to play many traditional games from my country, Indonesia. A game I played a lot was called One Leg Jump.’\nVoice 1 \n‘One leg jump’ is a good name for the game of hopscotch. That is because the name ‘one leg jump’ helps you understand how to play the game! The players mark squares on the ground using a stone or piece of chalk. Children in different parts of the world make different shapes or grids with the squares. But some things are always the same. The children all hop or jump on one leg from square to square. And they must not put a foot on any line.\nVoice 2 \nVery often, children play the game using a stone. They throw the stone onto square one and take their turn hopping on the whole grid. They hop to the last square. Then they turn round and hop back. On their next turn they will throw their stone onto square two. And on their next turn they throw on to square three and so on. If the stone does not land in the correct square, the child must lose a turn. Maria Lopez from Columbia told TOPICS how she enjoyed playing hopscotch when she was a child,\nVoice 5 \n‘When I was a little girl, most afternoons I used to play games with my friends in our street. Rayuela, as hopscotch is called in Spanish, was my favourite game. It is nice to remember playing games like Rayuela because it shows me that I had a happy time as a child surrounded by special people who always loved me.’\nVoice 1 \nIt may surprise you to learn that hopscotch is a very old game. Experts say that nearly 2000 years ago, Roman soldiers used something similar as an exercise. They had to hop up and down a 100 foot series of squares. They did this to make them stronger and quicker on their feet.\nVoice 2 \nMarbles is another ancient game that is played around the world. No one knows exactly how old it is. But we know the Romans played this game too. You can see children playing marbles on ancient Roman wall paintings.\nVoice 1 \nBut what are marbles? And how do you play the game of marbles? Marbles are very small hard balls. You can find marbles made from different sorts of stone, including the stone called ‘marble’. But most marbles are made from brightly coloured glass. People play many different sorts of games with their marbles. But all of these games are called simply ‘marbles’.\nVoice 2 \n‘The Ring Game’ is one popular game of marbles. A child uses a stone or chalk to make a circle or ring on the ground. Those playing the game put a few of their marbles into the ring. Each child rolls or shoots another marble to try to push one of the marbles out of the ring. If a player manages to do this he keeps that marble. Hakan Tuncer, from Turkey, played marbles as child. But he used a triangle shape – not a circle. He told TOPICS how he and his friends would compete for marbles,\nVoice 6 \n‘I think the most important thing was to have as many marbles as we could. We competed to win the most marbles. The person who won the most marbles was the leader of the group. And everyone tried to be the leader. Now I understand that this small competition was our first experience with power and leadership.’\nVoice 1 \nTraditional playground games are about more than just fun. Hopefully children continue to learn these games and their valuable lessons for hundreds more years.\nVoice 2 \nDo you remember playing traditional playground games when you were a child?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nImagine a world where monsters are real. But these are not the frightening creatures that you see in films. And they are also different from the monsters in traditional stories. Some of these monsters live with humans. Some live in the wild, like animals. These creatures are more intelligent than animals. They even have amazing special powers. Some can fly and breathe fire. One looks like a big black snake, with steel skin. But not all the monsters look so frightening. Some are very cute. Some are even beautiful. One very famous one looks like a yellow mouse with a big round face.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 2  \nThis imagined world of strange creatures is the world of Pokémon. And this world exists inside a video game! Today, this video game has grown to include television programs, books, trading cards, toys, and many other things. It is famous around the world. Today’s Spotlight is on the amazing world of Pokémon.\nVoice 1  \nSatoshi Tajiri created Pokémon. He was born in Japan in 1968. As a child, Tajiri loved collecting insects. He spent many hours by lakes. There, he observed different animals and insects. Tajiri told Time Magazine Asia:\nVoice 3  \n“Every time I found a new insect, it was a mystery to me. The more I searched for insects, the more I found. If I put my hand in the river, I would find water insects there. If there was a stick over a hole, I would find insects underneath it. As I gathered more, I learned more about them. I saw how some even eat each other.”\nVoice 2  \nBut Tajiri was also very interested in video games. As a young man, he played them all of the time. Tajiri knew he wanted to make video games as an adult. As young adults, he and a friend began their own video game company. One of their video games was an early version of Pokémon.\nVoice 1  \nTo make Pokémon, Tajiri combined the two things he loved most: insects and video games. As an adult, he remembered his experiences as a child. He remembered how he liked finding insects in the grass. He thought this could make a good game. People could collect Pokémon creatures like he collected insects. For him, collecting insects had been like exploring a new world. Could he give that experience to other people in a game?\nVoice 2  \nIn the game of Pokémon, the player plays the part of the trainer. A trainer is a person who works with Pokémon. Trainers travel around the game world. They collect as many different kinds of Pokémon as they can. Together, the trainer and Pokémon also enter competitions. They battle against other Pokémon and trainers.\nVoice 1  \nThe video game company Nintendo agreed to make Tajiri’s game. Tajiri wanted to make two games, called Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green. People would play them on Nintendo’s Game Boy. Game Boy was a very small video game system. A person could carry it with them. It was very popular with young children.\nVoice 2  \nBut the Game Boy had another important element that made it very important for the Pokémon game: the link cable. The link cable was a short black wire. It connected one Game Boy to another. Tajiri wanted people playing the game to collect Pokémon. But he also wanted them to trade Pokémon. They could do this through the link cable. Their Pokémon could even battle. This would give people another reason to play the game. Many video games involve only one person. But in Pokémon, many people could play at once. They could share in their experiences together. Tom Battey of Gamasutra.com shared his experience as a child. He says,\nVoice 4  \n“It was a process that brought us together. Some children get each other friendship bracelets. Or some come closer by sharing illegal experiences. We traded Pokémon.”\nColorful Pokemon X And Y Map clipart\nVoice 1  \nIt took six years to create the first Pokemon games. And Nintendo released the games on February 27, 1996. Satoshi Tajiri did not make money on Pokémon in the beginning. It was not an immediate success, even in Japan. People needed time to explore the world of Pokémon. But soon, they told their friends about it. And these friends told other friends. The game had many different levels and layers. Players could explore all parts of it.\nVoice 2  \nNintendo sold more and more Pokémon games. And Pokémon began to spread to other kinds of entertainment. A Pokémon television program began in Japan in 1997. One year later, the television program began in North America. Over one and a half million people watched it.\nVoice 1  \nAnother famous part of the Pokémon world is the trading card game.  These cards are thick pieces of paper. Each one has a different Pokémon on the front. Some are more difficult to find than others, just like in the video game. People can use the cards to play Pokémon, just like in the video game. They can trade their Pokémon and battle.\nVoice 2  \nToday, Pokémon is over 20 years old. Nintendo has released over 50 different Pokémon video games. The children who first played the game are adults. Some of them have children of their own. Now, these children can also explore the world of Pokémon. The idea of Pokémon has expanded to include books, television programs, toys and many other things. It continues to grow and become more popular.\nAsh Ketchum meets Pikachu; still from the Pokemon Television Program\nVoice 1  \nThe world of Pokémon has changed a lot. There are hundreds of new Pokémon. And there are new ways to play through the internet. People can now trade Pokémon online. They can make friends from other countries. But although the game has changed, much remains the same.\nVoice 2  \nDo you play Pokémon? What do you like about it most? Do you have a favorite Pokémon? Tell us what you think.

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.\nVoice 2\nIf you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.\nVoice 1\nBees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.\nVoice 2\nBees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.\nVoice 1\nBut to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!\nVoice 2\nIt takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.\nVoice 1\nThe day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.\nVoice 2\nWhen the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:\nVoice 3\n“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”\nVoice 1\nThe hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.\nVoice 2\nBut this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation is a local organization in Southern India. It has worked with the honey hunters for fifteen years. They aim to protect the environment and local culture. Robert Leo works for the Keystone Foundation. He tells the organization Slow Food International:\nVoice 4\n“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”\nVoice 2\nMany young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA city sits on the edge of the North Sea. It is very old . Some of buildings show this age. But many are surprisingly modern. High glass structures mix with ancient churches. And many canals run between these buildings. The Rhine River flows through the center of the city. The city is beautiful. It is like nowhere else in the world.\nVoice 2\nThis city is called Rotterdam. It is the largest city in the country of the Netherlands. And this city has a rich history that goes back over eight hundred years. But Rotterdam also has a problem: it is sinking. In fact, much of the Netherlands is sinking. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on this sinking country.\nVoice 1\nThe Netherlands has a long history of working with water. Over one third of the country is below sea level. In 800 B.C., much of the land was not land at all. It was under water! But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.\nVoice 2\nOver the years, the Dutch have developed many ways of keeping water out of the land. They built huge walls across lakes and the sea coast. These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.\nVoice 1\nWorking with water is very important to the Netherland’s success. It helped the country to grow. It is still a very small country. But today it is the seventeenth largest economy in the world!\nVoice 2\nBut removing water often has a downside. Much of the Netherlands is built on peat, a special kind of thick decaying plant material. Usually, peat rests on top of water. When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!\nVoice 1\nFor the people of Rotterdam, this is a very big problem. Many buildings there are very old. Some were built hundreds of years ago. They do not have good foundations. When the ground subsides, those foundations can break. If people do not do something, the buildings may fall over.\nVoice 2\nBut there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.\nVoice 1\nBut the people of the Netherlands are not giving up. Instead, they are making plans for the future. Some believe that the old methods will still work. The Dutch could continue to build dikes and pump water. But as sea levels rise, the cost of this method will go up as well.\nVoice 2\nInstead, the Dutch are doing something different. They are not completely keeping the water out. They are letting some in. They call this the “Room for the River” program. In this program, the Dutch ask people to leave some low areas near rivers. Or, they repurpose public places. If there is a flood, these areas will fill first. They will keep water out of larger cities and towns. Hans Docter is a Dutch ambassador. He spoke to Haaretz news service about the effort.\nVoice 3\n“That’s the idea of living with the sea. Living with the water. In the past, we tried to keep the water out as much as we could. Now, we join it much more to our living areas.”\nVoice 1\nThe Room for the Rivers project is part of a larger movement in the Netherlands. Subsidence and climate change are already happening. The country will get lower. And water levels will rise. It will be impossible to stop the water completely. So, the Dutch are changing their lives. They are trying to live with the new situation.\nVoice 2\nIn some places, these changes have already begun. Stan Fleerakkers is a farmer from the Netherlands. The government bought his farm as part of the room for the river project. But Fleerakkers did not want to move. So, the government built a large terp in the area. Fleerakkers moved his farm onto the terp. Now, when the area floods, there is water in his old farmland. But he is living high above it.\nVoice 1\nMany more people may soon live like Fleerakkers. The Dutch may build the land up instead of keeping the water out. Or, they may make their homes with new building standards. Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood. But the flood will not harm anyone. In Rotterdam, buildings are already made to hold or be above water.\nVoice 2\nThese efforts are very expensive. But in the Netherlands, it may be worth it. Fleerakkers spoke to the magazine Politico:\nVoice 4\n“It is not as expensive as when a village is flooded. We spend a lot of money in Holland on water management. We have to do it. If we do not, we will be flooded. There will be no factories. No people will live here. It will all be gone.”\nVoice 1\nMany other countries will soon need to think about these solutions themselves. As climate change gets worse, many other cities will be in danger of flooding. Cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and New Orleans are already dealing with the problem. No country can solve climate change by themselves. Everyone must work together to handle the issue. But many countries may look to the Netherlands as an example. They have a long history of dealing with water. That history may be just what the future needs.\nVoice 2\nDo you live in a place threatened by climate change?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Ruby still sleeps in the basket. She sleeps with her soft plaything. She likes to have both hands and feet holding something when she is lifted. Do you want to hold her?”\nVoice 1\nDiedre de Villiers is talking about a baby. But Ruby is not a human baby. She is a small furry animal – a koala. De Villiers is a koala researcher. She is caring for Ruby. De Villiers rescued Ruby from the mouth of a dog. And Ruby is sick. De Villiers will care for her until she is healthy. Then Ruby will be able to live in the trees with other wild koalas. Today’s Spotlight is on these koalas.\nVoice 2\nPeople often call koalas “koala bears.” A koala does look like a small size bear. Like a bear, it is covered with grey hair or fur. It has large ears, wide eyes and a long black nose. A koala has a round furry body like a bear. But a koala is not a bear – it is a marsupial.\nVoice 1\nMarsupials are animals that have a special way to carry their newborn babies. They have a pouch. The fur on their stomach can open to hold something – a bit like a bag. The koala mother carries her new baby in this pouch. This makes it easier for her to climb trees. Koalas spend most of their lives up in a tree. They eat tree leaves. Koalas particularly like the shiny, dark leaves of the eucalyptus tree.\nVoice 2\nEucalyptus trees grow in Eastern Australia. This is the home of the koalas too. Around the year 1800, Europeans settled in Australia. At this time, there were probably millions of koalas in Eastern Australia. The number is much smaller now. The Australian Koala Foundation says there are only about forty to eighty thousand koalas left. This sounds like a big number. However, koalas are in serious danger.\nVoice 1\nThe human population of Australia is growing. As people build more roads and houses, they cut down eucalyptus trees. But the koalas need these trees to survive. Trees provide shelter, food and safety for the koalas. Humans also build fences, drive vehicles and own dogs. These things can all be dangerous to a koala. Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles. They are even dying from simple things – like a person who cuts down several eucalyptus trees around his house.”\nVoice 2\nPeople also bring something else that harms koalas – disease. Koalas can die from human disease. It causes another problem too. Disease can change their behaviour. It can make koalas fight each other. Diseases can also make koalas unable to produce babies. This is a big problem because the number of koalas is shrinking. Many people are worried that soon there may be no koalas at all.\nVoice 1\nJoel Sartore is a photographer for National Geographic Magazine. He is very famous for his pictures of rare or endangered animals. He visited Eastern Australia to take pictures of koalas. Sartore took one particularly difficult picture. It was a picture of all the koalas that had died in one area during one week. The picture shows the bodies of thirteen koalas. Sartore tells National Geographic about it:\nVoice 4\n“I knew I had to get a picture of dead koalas for this story. But I kept having trouble. People at the animal clinic I was working with said it would look bad. The Australian government does not even like to say that these koalas are endangered. But the workers at one place I visited thought this was an important picture to make. They told me that in this area these animals will be completely gone in three to five years. They want the world to know that.”\nVoice 2\nThe koala has many enemies such as disease, dogs and people cutting down trees. But koalas have many friends too. Many people are working to protect the koalas from danger. People like Deidre de Villiers take care of hurt koalas. Some people even work with koalas in their own houses.\nVoice 1\nSamantha Longman is one of these people. She takes care of koala babies. She is like their mother! The baby koalas climb on her. They depend on her. She tells National Geographic about this work:\nVoice 5\n“It does not leave me much time for anything else! But the little creatures are part of our family. What we are doing is important.”\nVoice 2\nSome people work with the government to protect land and trees. The Australian Koala Foundation, or AKF, is asking the government to use more land as natural park areas. These parks would be a good place for koalas to live. The AKF would also like the government to create laws to protect koalas. They want to stop people from cutting down eucalyptus trees. Without eucalyptus trees, the koalas can not survive. The AKF website explains:\nVoice 6\n“Eighty percent of the land that koalas live on is on privately owned. It is often farmland – not in national parks. This is why the AKF wants a law that will prevent people from cutting down trees on their land. We want a law to encourage people to protect and manage the land where koalas live.”\nVoice 1\nThere is another way de Villiers works to protect koalas. She watches wild koalas. This way she can learn how the koalas are doing. She studies their health. And she studies the population growth of koalas in the area.\nVoice 2\nHumans have caused many problems for koalas in Australia. But de Villiers says that people and koalas can live together. People can make some changes that would help the koalas. They can drive more slowly. They can make sure that there are enough eucalyptus trees for the koalas to live in and eat.\nVoice 1\nOn one trip de Villiers studied Tee Vee – a koala she had watched for over a year.  To her surprise, de Villiers discovered Tee Vee had a young baby in her pouch. De Villiers shared her excited reaction with National Geographic:\nVoice 3\n“While there are still healthy babies, there is still hope.”\nVoice 2\nThe voices you heard were from the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1  \nDr. David Vaughan works in his laboratory. It is located at Mote Tropical Research Centre in Florida, in the United States. Dr. Vaughan’s laboratory is not a small room like other laboratories. He works outside by the ocean. Vaughan is a marine biologist. He works with very small creatures that live in the sea. People may not think this work is very important. But Dr. Vaughan has a question for such people. He asks:\nVoice 3  \n“Do you like to breathe?”\nVoice 2  \nAll life on earth depends on life in the ocean. Human activities have been destroying ocean life for many years. But now there is some good news for the oceans. Today’s Spotlight is on Dr. Vaughan’s work with underwater animals called corals.\nVoice 1  \nMany people think that coral is a plant or a shell. But corals are small animals that live under the ocean. These animals group together. They create beautiful shells made of minerals. This shell can grow in many colours and shapes. It can look like a wrinkled brain or a cabbage. It can even look like a tree or grow into tall, round pillars.\nVoice 2  \nMany coral shells together are called a coral reef. Reefs are found in more than 100 countries around the world. The largest and most famous is the Great Barrier Reef. It is off the north-eastern coast of Australia. This reef is thousands of kilometres long. Coral reefs can be large but they are also very delicate – it is easy to destroy them.\nVoice 1  \nA lot of the world’s coral has died. This is mostly because of changes in the environment. People pollute the water and cause changes to the oceans. Rising carbon dioxide levels are making the ocean hotter and more acidic. People also overfish – they catch and remove the fish that support coral.\nVoice 2  \nThe World Resources Institute did a study of coral reefs in 2011. They found that 60 percent of the world’s coral reefs are threatened. And they think that by 2030 more than 90 percent will be in danger.\nVoice 1  \nThis would be very bad for the earth. Coral reefs are not just beautiful underwater areas. They are also homes for thousands of different species of creatures. This includes many kinds of fish, plants, and other underwater animals.\nVoice 2  \nReefs are important to land too. Corals provide a barrier for many coastlands. Reefs protect land from high water and strong winds. They can stop damaging forces before they hit the coast.\nVoice 1  \nAnd reefs are good for people too. Recently, scientists have found that parts of coral can be used to treat diseases such as cancer, arthritis, asthma, and heart disease.\n Voice 2  \nFinally, creatures on land – including humans – need underwater creatures like coral to be able to breathe. The plants in the ocean produce most of the world’s oxygen gas. These plants depend on coral for protection and particular chemicals.\nVoice 1  \nScientists like David Vaughan have worked for decades to find ways to protect the coral reefs. Vaughan is over 60 years old. He has seen the coral reefs decrease over his lifetime. This made him very sad. But one day, he discovered something new to him. It was a very simple technology. And it changed everything for him. In a video published by The Atlantic, Dr. Vaughan said:\nVoice 3  \n“Ten years ago I was planning to work for two more years. But when we saw that there was this new technology for restoration, I had to stay working until it was done.”\nVoice 2  \nThe new technology that Dr. Vaughan discovered is called “micro-fragmentation”. This technology works with micro-fragments – very small broken-up pieces. Scientists break the corals into small pieces. The coral grows very quickly using its own natural healing process. Using micro-fragmentation, corals grow 25 to 50 times faster than they would in other situations.\nVoice 1  \nDr. Vaughan discovered this process accidentally. One day he broke an old piece of coral apart. He thought it would die but it did the opposite! Vaughan told the Herald Tribune about it.\nVoice 3  \n“I picked up the coral, expecting to see it was worse. But it had completely grown over a hole the size of a large coin. From birth, it took that coral two years to grow to that size and it had grown back in two weeks.”\nVoice 2  \nDr. Vaughan’s team is now producing thousands of corals by micro-fragmentation. They work mostly with the coral in Florida Reef Tract, on the south-eastern coast of the US. They grow the coral in large tanks of water in his research laboratory. Then they put them back into the ocean. They attach the new corals to old corals that have died. Some of the new planted coral has died. But most of it continues to grow. And Dr. Vaughan and his team are learning more every day about how to make the new coral successful.\nVoice 1  \nThese fast-growing corals are an amazing new hope for oceans. But Dr. Vaughan himself also brings hope. Many people who are Dr. Vaughan’s age stop working and retire. But he is continuing to work. Lindsay Arick works with Dr. Vaughan. She talked to the AARP – an organization in the United States for people over 50 years old. In a video, she said:\nVoice 4  \n“Dr. Vaughan has seen the coral reef destroyed even more than any of us has. He saw it when it was beautiful. Now I may see it when I am Dr. Vaughan’s age the way he saw it when he was my age! So we are going to switch the generations. I can finally see what the reef looked like 60 years ago compared to now.”\nVoice 2  \nDr. Vaughan says that he will not stop working until there are a million corals back on the reef. He thinks this can be done in three to five years. He tells the AARP why he thinks his method will be successful. He says:\nVoice 3 \n“People think that we have ruined this planet with technology. But with technology we can bring it back.”\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen coral in real life or pictures? What do you think people can do to protect areas of coral?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nPicture a dark black sky. Suddenly, a large line of light appears. It looks like someone cut through the sky with a knife. The light shines through the opening.\nVoice 2 \nNow, the light begins to move. It gets softer. It starts to look green in colour. The lines of light move around the sky. They look like they may touch the ground very far away.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nThen, a burst of light appears! There are more colors now. They look like rays of sunshine all over the sky. The lights are changing very fast. They form a large curtain. The curtain moves. It looks like it is dancing. The lights dance away back into the dark black sky.\nVoice 2 \nThese lights in the sky are called the Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. Today’s Spotlight is on these Northern Lights.\nVoice 1 \nPierre Gassendi was a famous scientist and philosopher in the early 1600s.  He was the one who named the Aurora Borealis. This name comes from Ancient Roman stories. Aurora was the name that Romans gave to the goddess of the dawn – the rising of the sun. The second half, Borealis, is named after the north wind. So in English Aurora Borealis means “the dawn of the north.”\nVoice 2 \nIf you live in the Northern part of the world you may have seen the northern lights before. They also appear in the far south. There they are called the Aurora australis. The Northern Lights appear in many colors. People most often see green or red. The color is different depending on how far north or south you are. The Northern Lights also look different at different altitudes – they look different high up in the mountains than at sea level.\nThe Northern Lights in Scotland, Isle of Mull; Image by mcbeaner from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nBut what are the Northern lights? What causes them? People have been wondering about this for years. The Northern lights are a part of folk culture in many countries. People around the world have traditional stories that explain the Northern lights. Here are a few of them:\nVoice 2 \nDuring the Viking period, people thought that the Northern Lights were images of young women who were dead. Other people believed that the northern lights were signs of huge fires in the north. And other people thought that it was God lighting up the cold, dark parts of the world.\nVoice 1 \nInuit people believe that the lights are the land of the dead. They believe that dead friends in this land try to connect with living people. They think that this is what is happening when the lights change very fast.\nVoice 2 \nThe lights often change shape and color. The Scots call them “merry dancers” because of this movement. Some Native Americans believe that they can connect with spirits of the dead by whistling at the lights.\nVoice 1 \nDanish people have a traditional story about the Northern Lights. They say that a group of large white birds called swans once flew too far north. The swans got caught in the ice. They moved their wings up and down, flapping to get free. Every time they flapped their wings, they made images in the sky. These images became the northern lights.\nVoice 2 \nBut not every country had a nice story about the Northern Lights like the Danish. Some cultures believed that the Northern Lights represented evil. They were afraid of the lights. They thought the lights were a terrible force. And many people believed that the Northern Lights caused natural disasters, like earthquakes or floods.\nVoice 1 \nThese traditional stories are very interesting. But there is a scientific cause of the northern lights – the Sun!\nVoice 2 \nSometimes there are storms on the sun. These storms release a cloud of solar particles into space. The solar particles are made up of atoms that have a magnetic charge. They are full of electric forces.\nVoice 1 \nSome of these magnetic solar particles come near to the earth. When they do, they are pulled in by the earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls the particles to the two magnetic poles on the earth: the North Pole and the South Pole.\nA representation of Earth’s magnetic field By Drdan14 at the English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0\nVoice 2 \nThe Northern Lights appear when the solar particles crash into the gas of the earth’s atmosphere. More solar particles make the lights bigger and brighter. In certain years, the sun has more storms. During these times, the northern lights can be seen from farther away. They may also be larger than usual. Rachel VanderVeen lives in Northern Canada. She says that the year 2012 had many solar storms. She tells Spotlight what happened:\nVoice 3 \n“My husband does not often run. But one day he was walking home from school when the northern lights began. They moved across the dark sky in many colours. Even with the light from the town, they were amazing. Usually, we see the Northern Lights in bright green. But that day the colours made my husband run to find me. The lights were pink, purple and orange. We have lived in the north for many years now. That was the first time we have seen so many bright colours.”\nVoice 1 \nYou can see why so many people believe that the Northern Lights are special. People travel from all over the world just to see the Northern Lights. But it is difficult to capture such an amazing sight.  Some people spend days taking pictures of the lights.  Other people try to describe the northern lights in words. Today’s program ends with a part of a poem about the Northern Lights. It is called ‘The Aurora Borealis’ by S. Moore:\nVoice 4 \nThe Aurora Borealis or northern light\nWith its movements so strangely bright,\nMoving and dancing along the sky –\nA picture of beauty to please the eye.\n\nHow sweetly the shining particles fly!\nHow quickly the flashes of light in the sky!\nYou would think the young angels had gathered in crowds\nTo play hide-and-seek through the golden clouds,\n\nLet wise philosophers search out the cause,\nAnd tell me the Science of Nature’s laws;\nAnd how these magnetic rays of light\nEnrich the north of a frosty night.\n\nSo let the stories be what they may,\nI love to look on the bright display\nOf the ever moving, changing hues,\nSeen in these grand but short lived views.\nThe Northern Lights in Norway; Image by John Huang from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThe writers of this program were Sara DeKoster and Rena Dam.

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nDo you recognize this sound? It is the small high noise of the mosquito. Mosquitoes are small insects with wings. They bite people and take blood from their bodies. When mosquitoes bite people they leave behind a small raised red area on the skin. People with mosquito bites may feel like they need to keep rubbing or scratching their skin in this area. These little insects are a problem for people and animals in many parts of the world. Today’s Spotlight is on mosquitoes. These interesting insects are a big problem.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThere are over 3,000 different kinds of mosquitoes. To some people, that is a very frightening fact! Many people know how dangerous mosquitoes can be. Some mosquitoes can carry diseases. They can give these diseases to people and animals. And some of these diseases cause death.\nVoice 1 \nBut people can stop mosquitoes. Let’s look at the life of the mosquito. When a female mosquito is full grown, she mates with a male mosquito. Then she begins searching for a “host.” A host is a person or animal that she can land on. A mosquito can sense a host from up to 35 meters away.\nVoice 2 \nMost mosquitoes do not travel very far. They usually travel less than a kilometer during their whole life. But some mosquitoes can travel far. Some mosquitoes can travel 160 kilometers in some conditions.\nVoice 1 \nWhen the female mosquito finds a host, she bites him.  Mosquitoes have a special mouth. When a mosquito bites you, it actually puts part of its mouth under your skin. The mosquito also releases chemicals into your body. These chemicals make your blood flow faster into the mosquito. These chemicals are also responsible for the red bumps that many people experience after a mosquito bite.\nA mosquito bite; Image by Hans Braxmeier from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nAfter a mosquito bites her host, she fills herself up with his blood. She is not eating this blood. Instead, she is storing it. This blood will be very important for her babies. They will use the protein in the blood.\nVoice 1 \nOnly the female mosquito bites a host for her babies. For food, mosquitoes live on nectar, or sweet liquid that comes from plants. Male mosquitoes live for only a short time after they mate. But a female mosquito can have a few groups of babies without mating again.\nVoice 2 \nMosquitoes grow through four separate periods of growth. These periods are called the egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This whole process takes about one to two weeks.\nVoice 1 \nWhen the female mosquito is ready, she lays her eggs. Different kinds of mosquitoes lay their eggs in different places. They can lay their eggs in a small container of water. Or they can lay their eggs in large wet fields. But all mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in some kind of water.\nVoice 2 \nMost eggs hatch in about two days. Then the baby mosquitoes are called larva. The larva lives in the water. During this stage, the larvae grow. They lose their skin four times. This is called “moulting.” After their fourth moult, a larva begins the pupal stage.\nWater like this is a perfect place for mosquito eggs; Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nDuring the pupal stage, young mosquitoes begin to move. They float on the surface of the water. A special skin surrounds the pupa. Inside this skin, the pupa is changing into an adult mosquito. This process takes about two days. When the mosquito is completely developed the skin splits open. And the mosquito is now an adult!\nVoice 2 \nThe adult mosquito comes out from the water. It must rest on the water to dry. Each part of its body must become hard. After its wings have dried, the mosquito can fly. And a short time after that, the mosquito can mate. Then the females go in search of blood to make more little mosquitoes. And the process begins again!\nVoice 1 \nMosquitoes live in many areas of the world. But mosquitoes live best in a warm climate. And since they have so much contact with blood, they can be very dangerous. Mosquitoes can carry terrible viruses like west Nile, yellow fever, and malaria to humans and animals. These viruses create disease in their human hosts that can kill them. But not all mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. In fact, many mosquitoes do not carry viruses at all. However, it is difficult to know which mosquitoes are dangerous and which ones are not.\nVoice 2 \nMany people try to avoid mosquitoes. But have you ever noticed that mosquitoes seem to bite some people more than others? In fact, scientists believe that about 20 percent of people are more likely to get mosquito bites than others. Scientists who study mosquitoes believe that mosquitoes are attracted to, or pulled in, because of particular chemicals that come off people’s bodies. Some people produce more of these chemicals than other people. Mosquitoes can also smell the chemicals in the air a person breathes out.\nVoice 1 \nThere are ways to avoid mosquitoes — to stay healthy and for your own comfort. Here are some ways to avoid, stop, or kill mosquitoes near your home.\nVoice 2 \nFirst, do not let water sit for a long time. Mosquitoes need this still, stale water to lay their eggs. Experts say that this is the most important thing to do to avoid mosquitoes.\nVoice 1 \nSecond, mosquitoes usually go out more in the early morning and early night. A person can avoid mosquitoes by not going out at these times.\nMosquitos coming out at sunset; Image by Kranich17 from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThird, in areas where mosquitoes are dangerous, use screens or nets over sleeping areas. These fabrics have many very small holes. The holes are big enough to let air through. But mosquitoes cannot fit through the holes. Also, nets that are treated with chemicals that kill insects are very helpful for stopping mosquitoes and malaria.\nVoice 1 \nFinally, when you can, wear clothes to cover most of your skin. Following these tips can help keep you free from mosquitoes.\nVoice 2 \nHow do you avoid mosquitoes? Are they a problem where you live? Do they bite you? Tell us what about your experiences.

It is easier for people to understand – no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3 \n“Once I knew only darkness and stillness. My life was without past or future. But a little word from the fingers of another person fell into my empty hand. And then my heart suddenly opened to the wonder of living.”\nVoice 1 \nHelen Adams Keller wrote these hopeful words. Her childhood was dark and silent. Yet she became an encouraging writer and teacher for many people. Today’s Spotlight is on the writer and educator Helen Keller.\nVoice 2 \nHelen Keller was born in 1880 in the United States. She was a healthy baby. But Helen became very sick when she was one and a half years old. No one knew what kind of sickness she had. Now, experts think she may have had scarlet fever or meningitis. Her sickness was very serious. Her family believed that Helen was going to die.\nVoice 1 \nHelen did not die. She seemed to recover from her sickness. Her family was very happy. But all was not well. Helen’s mother saw that Helen’s behaviour had changed. Helen did not react to noise. She did not react to movement either. When Helen’s mother placed her hand in front of Helen’s eyes, Helen did not move. She could not see. She could not hear. The sickness had left Helen blind and deaf.\nVoice 2 \nLife for Helen and her family was difficult. Helen became a troublesome child. She smashed things in the house. She was angry. She was intelligent but she had no way to communicate. By the time she was six years old, Helen’s family needed a new way to help her. They travelled to an institute for the blind. Doctors there said that Helen would never see or hear again. But the director of the institute told them not to lose hope. He said that Helen could learn. She only needed a teacher.\nVoice 1 \nThis teacher was Anne Sullivan. Anne was a 20 year old student at the institute for the blind. Anne had lost most of her eyesight at the age of five. At the institute for the blind she had operations on her eyes. Then she could see better. Anne went to live with the Keller family as Helen’s teacher. Later, Helen wrote:\nVoice 3 \n“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.”\nVoice 2 \nAnne changed Helen’s life. She showed Helen love and support. Helen began to trust Anne. Soon Helen’s behavior improved. Anne also began to teach Helen words. Anne used her finger to write the letters of words on Helen’s hand. Helen repeated the finger movements. But she did not understand the meaning of the letters and words.\nVoice 1 \nThen, a small event changed Helen forever. One day, Helen and Anne were walking outside. They passed a water well. Anne took Helen’s hands. On one hand she wrote the letters w – a – t – e – r. On the other hand, she poured cool water. Suddenly, Helen understood the meaning of the word water. She now understood the symbols of language.\nVoice 2 \nAfter this, Helen wanted to know more and more. Anne continued to teach her words and their meanings. Soon Anne taught Helen to read and write. Helen did this through her sense of touch. People were very surprised that Helen could read, write and communicate! This was not common for blind people in the 1800s. But Helen did not ever give up. She wrote:\nVoice 3 \n“When we do the best we can, we never know what miracle is made in our life, or in the life of another.”\nVoice 1 \nIn 1900 Helen went to Radcliff College, in England. Helen became the first deaf and blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. At college Helen also began to write about her life. Helen wrote many books. Some of the books were about her life. Other books were about her Christian faith. Much of her writing was political.\nVoice 2 \nHelen Keller saw that many blind people lived in poor conditions. Blind people did not get a good education. But Helen showed that it is possible for blind people to live happy, productive lives. She wrote,\nVoice 3 \n“The public must learn that the blind man has a mind that can be educated. He has a hand that can be trained. He has dreams that are right for him to work towards.”\nVoice 1 \nHelen was also very interested in justice for blind people in other countries. She travelled to 40 countries around the world. She gave speeches and brought hope to many people. The communities that Helen Keller visited increased their efforts for blind people.\nVoice 2 \nHelen did not only work for justice for blind people. She did not like injustice of any kind. She worked for social rights, woman’s rights and for peace. She believed that God created all people equal. She thought that all people had equal rights to a good life. She said:\nVoice 3 \n“The world is full of suffering. But it is full also of overcoming suffering. I am only one; but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something.”\nVoice 1 \nHelen Keller kept writing and giving speeches until she was an old woman. She won many awards and knew many famous people. But after she turned 80 Helen had some health problems. She moved back to her home and lived simply.\nVoice 2 \nHelen Keller died peacefully at the age of 88. Her life brought hope and courage to millions of people. And she continues to encourage people all around the world with wise words such as these:\nVoice 3 \n“True happiness is not found through helping yourself but through faithfulness to a good purpose… The best and most beautiful things in life cannot be seen or touched. They are felt in the heart.”\nVoice 1 \nThe writers of this program were Marina Santee and Rena Dam. The producer of this program was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nA group of people wait in a room. They have gathered in a famous restaurant in Basel, Switzerland. They are waiting to eat dinner. Soon, a waiter arrives to guide them to their table. This is all a normal experience at a restaurant. But then, something unusual happens.\nVoice 2 \nThe waiter asks everyone in the group to remove their watches and telephones. He puts these things in a box. Then, these guests form a line. Each person holds the shoulder of the person in front of them. The waiter stands at the front. He walks through one dark cloth curtain, and then another. He leads the group into a room that is completely dark. No one can see anything. It is like they are all blind. In fact, some people in the room are blind. This special restaurant is called Blinde Kuh. It is designed to share the experience of blindness with people who can see. The waiters and many other workers here are blind. Today’s Spotlight is on Blinde Kuh, and the experience of eating in the dark.\nVoice 1 \nThe World Health Organization says that around the world about 39 million people are blind. Some people are born blind. Others lose their ability to see in accidents. Some diseases also cause blindness. This is particularly true in places where people cannot get treatment from doctors.\nVoice 2 \nBeing blind can be very difficult. In many places, blind people are not given their full human rights. It is difficult for blind people to work. Many blind people have to depend on their families to survive. Sometimes, they must even ask other people for food and money. But what if there was work that only blind people could do? What if there were jobs that used the particular skills of blind people?\nVoice 1 \nJorge Speilmann is a Christian leader who lives in Zurich, Switzerland. He is blind. In the late 1990s, he opened the restaurant Blinde Kuh. It won many awards for his interesting business idea. But Speilmann did not start the restaurant to win awards. He did not plan to make a lot of money. Speilmann had two simple goals. He wanted to create jobs for blind people. And he wanted to show people what it is like to be blind.\nVoice 2 \nSpeilmann often invited friends into his home to share a meal. They would ask what it was like to be blind. So he would cover their eyes with dark cloth when they ate. His guests found that the meal was very different. They said that they had to concentrate on their food. They listened carefully to the people around them. They found it very interesting. Without their eyes, people use different senses. They concentrate more on hearing, smell, or touch. Food even has a different taste!\nVoice 1 \nToday, there are many restaurants like Blinde Kuh, where people eat in the dark. There are many differences between them. But all of them work in a similar way to Blinde Kuh. Guests enter into a lighted space. Here they order their food or buy drinks. In some of these restaurants, guests can choose a “mystery meal”. They will not know what they are eating. They have to use their other senses to recognize the food! They talk with their friends, and other guests. Some look around the room. They seem worried. This will be the last time they see anything for the next few hours.\nVoice 2 \nThen, a waiter enters. A restaurant waiter usually takes orders and serves food. At the dark dining restaurants, the waiter does more. It is unusual for a blind person to be a guide. But in these restaurants, the waiter is the guide for the guests. To enter the restaurant, one guest holds the waiter’s shoulders. Then, the next guest holds the shoulder of the first guest. Soon the guests form a line behind the waiter. Then, the waiter begins to walk. He leads the guests into the dining room. Here it is very dark. The guests cannot see anything. But the waiter never gets lost. He has done this many times. He does not need to see.\nVoice 1 \nAt many dark dining restaurants, guests do not eat alone. The tables are very large. Everyone sits together. So people may sit next to someone they have never met. Many people find it difficult to eat and talk with strangers. But sitting in the dark, they feel differently. People feel that they can speak without being judged. No one can see at all. So people sometimes do things that they would not normally do. They find a kind of freedom in the dark room.\nVoice 2 \nThere are many difficulties. Guests may spill food or drink. They may drop their forks or knives. Some people cannot easily find their own mouth. Sometimes, people even feel afraid of the new, strange situation. The guests depend on their blind waiter for everything. But for most people, these difficulties are also a chance to learn.\nVoice 1 \nAfter eating, guests often talk with their waiters. In some restaurants, waiters even tell stories to the whole group of guests. They talk about their experiences at the restaurant. And they tell stories about the rest of their lives. Blind people are often treated like they are less able than people who can see. They may learn to feel that their experiences are not as important. But the darkness of the restaurant changes this. While dining in the dark, everyone is blind. Here, blind people are the experts – they know more about living without sight than anyone!\nVoice 2 \nThese restaurants give blind people jobs. They give people who can see a new way of thinking. But most of all, they give blind people something they do not get enough of – respect. People who can see learn more about the experience of being blind. Jorge Spielmann talked to writer Jacqueline Harmon Butler about this goal. He said,\nVoice 3 \n“We would not want anyone to be blind. We just want people to have the chance to experience the world the way we experience it.”\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann. The producer was Steven Hofman.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIt was a sunny day on the East coast of the United States. Joni Eareckson Tada was 17 years old. She was standing by a lake. Tada began a strong dive into the water. She did not know that in a moment her life would change forever. Today’s Spotlight is on the amazing life of Joni Eareckson Tada.\nVoice 2 \nTada dove head-first into the lake. But the water was not deep. She hit her head on the bottom of the lake. She heard a loud quick noise. After that, she could not move. Tada was trapped under the water. She wanted to call for help. But she could not open her mouth under the water. No matter how hard she tried, Tada could not get up. She did not understand what was happening. She was holding her breath. But she could not last much longer under the water.\nJoni before the accident, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nFinally, Tada’s sister, Kathy, pulled her out of the water. Tada could finally breathe. But she still could not move her arms or legs. An emergency vehicle brought Tada to the hospital. She was very frightened. She asked Kathy to hold her hand while they were waiting. Kathy told Tada that she was already doing that. Tada was surprised. She could not feel her sister’s hand.\nVoice 2 \nAt the hospital, doctors discovered that Tada had broken an important bone in her neck. She was now a quadriplegic. She could not feel or move any part of her body below her shoulders. And this condition would never change. Tada was in the hospital for a long time. She thought she would probably die. She did not die. But her life, as she knew it, had changed completely.\nVoice 1 \nTada experienced intense depression for a long time. At first, she could not accept what had happened to her. She thought it was unfair that she would never move her body again. She was angry that her life had changed so much. She wanted to die. She wrote about her experiences:\nVoice 3 \n“I asked many of my friends to assist me in suicide. I wanted to find a final escape. I could not face the possibility of sitting down for the rest of my life without the use of my hands, without the use of my legs. All my hopes seemed destroyed.”\nVoice 2 \nBut then Tada began to have more hopeful thoughts. She was a Christian. Before the accident, she felt like she was not living her life very well. She had prayed that God would change her. She wanted to be a better person. And now, after months of depression Tada had a new idea. She wondered if the accident might have been God’s answer to her prayer. Tada began to study the Christian Bible. She read what God teaches about pain, suffering, and healing. Tada says:\nVoice 3 \n“I have discovered that God can heal. He does heal. But he is not required to heal… He has shown me that my suffering is part of a better plan.”\nJoni begins speaking in public about her accident, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nToday Tada believes that her accident was the beginning of a long and difficult process. It was the process of becoming more like Jesus Christ. Tada writes:\nVoice 3 \n“God used this injury to develop in me patience and endurance and tolerance and self-control and steadfastness and sensitivity and love and joy. Those things did not matter much to me when I was on my feet. But, oh boy, they began to matter after I began living in a wheelchair.”\nVoice 2 \nTada learned that her worth did not depend on being able to move her body. Instead, she could use her situation to help people who were dealing with suffering. And Tada has done this in many ways. She has written over 50 books for people of all ages. Tada learned to paint beautiful pictures. She paints by holding a paintbrush in her mouth! Tada has also worked with government officials to help people with disabilities. She is a singer, a speaker, a writer, an actor, a wife, and an encouragement to many people.\nJoni drawing Christmas Art, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 1 \nTada is the president of a group called Joni and Friends. It is a group that helps people with disabilities in many countries. Every day Joni broadcasts a short radio program for Joni and Friends. Her program is broadcast in many different countries. She tries to help people understand pain and suffering. She encourages everyone to work with people with disabilities. Nate Dell works with Spotlight English. He went to see Joni Eareckson Tada at a conference in 2015. He told Spotlight how she changed the way he thinks:\nVoice 4 \n“I had heard of Joni before I ever got to see her speak. Before, her quadriplegia seemed to be just a discussion starter for her message. But Joni parked her chair right beside where I was sitting! And I saw how her disability affects every part of her life. She had two women helping her. They held a water bottle for Joni to drink from. They helped her wipe her nose. They even adjusted her clothing. I do all of these things without even thinking about it! Joni’s message is that God loves us – even through difficult circumstances and suffering. Hearing this message from a wheelchair was very powerful.”\nVoice 2 \nTada has continued to have struggles. She often has problems with her muscles. She feels a lot of pain. In 2010, Tada had treatment for breast cancer. But throughout all these difficulties, Tada kept her trust in God. She says:\nVoice 3 \n“My weakness, that is, my quadriplegia, is my greatest strength. It forces me into the arms of Christ every single morning when I get up.”\nYou can find Joni Eareckson Tada’s song Alone Yet Not Alone on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIn 2014 Tada recorded a song. It became very famous. Over a million people watched the Youtube video of “Alone But Not Alone.” We end today’s program with some words from this song. They show Joni Eareckson Tada’s faith, and the strength it brings her every day of her life.\nVoice 3 \n“I will not be bent in fear.God is the shelter I know is near.In His strength I find my own.By His faithful mercies shown.When my steps are lost and desperate for a guide,I can feel his touch, a soothing presence by my side.I am alone yet not alone.”\nJoni shares her hope, Photo courtesy of Joni and Friends\nVoice 2 \nThe writers of this program were Liz Waid and Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nIt is an autumn day in Iowa, in the United States. A small crowd of people gather together. They are standing in a huge, flat field. All around, there is green grass and farm land. In the far distance, there is a round target. On the target, there are brightly colored rings or circles.\nVoice 2 \nOne man stands in front of the crowd. He holds a bow – a weapon that shoots arrows. He gently places an arrow on the bow. He pulls the arrow back toward his ear. He carefully aims at the target. He releases the bow. The arrow flies through the air. After 210 meters, the arrow hits the target. The crowd cheers. The archer has set a new world record. He has completed the world’s longest archery shot to hit a target.\nVoice 1 \nThis is an amazing event. But it is even more amazing than you might think. The archer that broke the record is Matt Stutzman. And he has no arms! Today’s Spotlight is on Matt Stutzman, the armless archer.\n\n\nVoice 2 \nMatt Stutzman was born in 1982. When he was born, he did not have arms. He was disabled, but he was healthy in every other way. When Stutzman was 4 months old, his parents decided that they could not care for him.  They wanted someone to adopt him. So, they surrendered their parental rights. They hoped that other parents would care for their son – and make him a part of their family.\nVoice 1 \nWhen Stutzman was 10 months old, Leon and Jean Stutzman did just that. They adopted him. The Stutzmans raised Matt on their family farm. They loved and cared for him. They taught him to work hard. And even though he had a disability, they encouraged him to try and do anything he wanted to do. Jean Stutzman wrote about Matt’s story on the website mattstutzman.com. She explained,\nVoice 3 \n“Our family plan was to give Matt the freedom to try almost anything – if he could complete it on his own. The natural reaction would have been to quickly enter each situation and help him.”\nVoice 2 \nHowever, the Stutzmans chose not to help Matt right away. They chose to let him try, fail and try again. If Matt could not find a way to do something, they would help him. But they always let him try alone first.\nVoice 1 \nThis may seem like an unusual way to raise a child with a disability. But Matt Stutzman is thankful for his parents’ teaching. They taught him that if you think something is not possible, then it will not be possible. But if you work hard and believe it is possible, you can achieve great things. Stutzman believes this has helped him succeed at many things in life – including archery. Today, Stutzman lives a completely un-adapted life. He has not changed anything in his home or car to make it easier for him to live without arms. He also does not use prosthetic arms – arms created by doctors and scientists. The way the Stutzmans raised Matt has strongly influenced him. On his website, he explains,\nVoice 4\n“I was born without arms. But I was blessed to have two amazing and patient parents that raised me. They taught me a long time ago, that impossible is a way of thinking. And they taught me not to think that way. This has served me well.”\nVoice 2 \nStutzman was blessed with good parents. But he was also born with very good physical skill. Stutzman quickly learned to do many things with his feet. In fact, he could do many things with his feet better than most people could do these same things with their hands. It was clear at an early age that he had good skill and aim.\nVoice 1 \nStutzman told the Telegraph news organization a funny story about this. When he was young, he used to pull fruit off the trees on his family farm. Often, he would use his feet to kick the fruit at his brother. For most people, kicking a small piece of fruit and aiming it well would be difficult. But Stutzman said he could hit his brother in the head every time! Stutzman recognized at this young age that he had great physical ability. And he learned to use his physical ability to do many things. This helped him as he grew up.\nVoice 2 \nWhen Stutzman was 16 years old, he bought his first bow and arrow. He wanted to hunt animals with it. After buying the bow, Stutzman needed to learn how to shoot it without arms. But there was no one to teach him how to do this. Stutzman joked about this with the NPR news organization. He said,\nVoice 4 \n“If you search the internet using Google and write – ‘how to teach a guy without arms to shoot’ – you will not find that. Usually, you can find anything on Google. But you just cannot find that.”\nVoice 1 \nSo Stutzman had to teach himself. He learned to hold the bow with his feet. He also learned to use the side of his mouth to guide the release of the arrow from the bow. It is an unusual method for shooting a bow and arrow. But Stutzman believes that his lack of arms is helpful in archery. He told the MSNBC news organization,\nVoice 4 \n“I believe how I shoot is an advantage. I use my leg and my leg is the strongest part of my body.”\nVoice 2 \nStutzman’s skill, method and desire to compete have made him very successful. On October 30, 2011, Stutzman set the World Record for the longest archery shot to hit a target. And in September of 2012, he won a silver medal award at the London Paralympic Games. Stutzman hopes this is just the beginning of his success. He told the KCCI news organization,\nVoice 4 \n“I want to be the best in world. Not just the best archer with no arms or with a disability. This is what encourages me to keep training and working.”\nVoice 1 \nHowever, winning is not Stutzman’s only reason for competing. He also wants to encourage people. Stutzman told Telegraph news,\nVoice 4 \n“I hope that I can affect even one person in a positive way. If I can show one person that life is not so bad and that they can achieve anything – that is very important for me.”\nVoice 2 \nThe writer of this program was Robin Basselin.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA crowd of people is standing in a circle. They are watching a young man perform. There is a music player next to him. It is playing loud music with a strong beat. He is performing amazing dance moves. The young man is spinning on his head. He is jumping and flipping with the music. He is wearing a hat and large trousers. The hat helps his head slide across the surface. And the large trousers hide thick pads that cover and protect his knees.\nVoice 2\nThis young man is not performing just any normal dance. This kind of dance is called “breaking” or “breakdance.” A dancer who does this kind of dance is a “bboy” or “bgirl.” Today’s Spotlight is on breaking and the people who perform it.\nVoice 1\nBreaking began in the United States in the 1970s. A man called Kool Herc liked to have parties at his home in New York City. He played music and people danced. He was very skilled at mixing the songs together and playing the best parts of each song.\nVoice 2\nEach song had a part where the words stopped, but the music continued. The music had only quick drumming and rhythm. This was called the “break” of the song. Kool Herc played these parts over and over. People danced longer when he played more breaks. They called the dance ‘breaking.’ And Kool Herc called the dancers at his parties ‘bboys’ and ‘bgirls.’\nDJ Kool Herc; By Mika Väisänen – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=38430378\nVoice 1\nKool Herc’s parties also began a new part of culture. It was based around a particular kind of music. People called it Hip Hop. Breaking is just one part of Hip Hop. It includes different kinds of music: rapping and DJing. It also includes graffiti. This is the art of painting words and pictures on walls, often without permission.\nVoice 2\nOver time, bboys and bgirls created different kinds of basic steps to breaking. The first is called ‘Toprock’. This is when the dancer jumps around on his feet when he first begins dancing. He listens to the rhythm of the music and first starts moving.\nVoice 1\nThe second kind of step in breaking is called ‘Downrock’. This part of breaking uses the hands and feet on the floor. A dancer moves around on the floor in creative ways. Her hands and feet equally support her movements. She rolls and turns. She moves her arms and legs around into shapes.\nVoice 2\nThe most difficult part of breaking is ‘power.’ This move requires a lot of skill and strength. A dancer’s head and shoulders are near the ground. But his legs are in the air. In this position, he turns in a fast circle. This kind of move often makes the crowd very happy.\nVoice 1\nThe last kind of move is a ‘freeze.’ This is when the dancer suddenly stops moving in a surprising position. She stays very still when the music changes or stops. A dancer may also end her dance with a move called a “suicide”. In this move, a dancer acts as if she is going to fall. It looks painful and dangerous. But she controls her fall so she is not hurt.\nA freeze. Image by Zlatko Jankovski from Pixabay\nVoice 2\nIn the 1980s, breaking became very popular. Bboys and bgirls appeared on television. They danced in movies. Suddenly, everyone knew about this special dance!\nVoice 1\nThese television performances were the first time many people saw women dancing in this way. The bgirls flipped and danced just like the bboys. They performed difficult dance moves. They were just as strong and creative as the bboys. This surprised many people watching the performance.\nVoice 2\nToday there are still many more bboys than bgirls. Breaking takes a lot of strength. It is a powerful dance. Many people see the dance as only for men. But more and more women are learning. There are special groups and competitions only for women.\nVoice 1\nIn fact, competitions are important to breaking. Breaking competitions are called battles. Two groups of dancers compete against each other. Each group stands on one side of a circle. People gather around the circle to watch the competition. A DJ starts to play music. Three judges sit at the edge of the circle and watch.\nVoice 2\nThe first person goes to the middle of the circle and breaks. When he is done, a dancer from the other team dances in the center. She tries to dance better than the first person. Each person from each group dances once in the middle of the circle.\nVoice 1\nAfter every person from both groups has danced, the judges choose a winning group. The judges choose the team with the most skill, best attitude, and the most interesting moves. After the battle, the groups often talk to each other. They shake hands with each other. When the battle is over, they often become friends. They have learned to respect each other’s creativity and skill.\nVoice 2\nBattles like this are one way that breaking builds communities. Sometimes people who do not agree can meet together for a battle. They compete with each other through dance instead of violence. They learn to respect each other. Sometimes dancers even meet together to practice after the battle. They learn from each other.\nVoice 1\nBreaking has this effect all over the world. There are bboys and bgirls on every continent. The dance is a little different in each country. But the style and basic steps are the same.\nVoice 2\nOften, people combine breaking with other kinds of performance. People in Japan and South Korea combine breaking with martial arts. These fighting sports include karate, kung fu, and taekwondo. Breakers add kicks and punches to the dance. They move in short, quick motions. Their clothes also show an influence from martial arts. These dancers may wear traditional breaking clothes and martial arts clothes together. They may wear white pants. Or they may wear a colored piece of cloth around their heads.\nImage by Shaun Stanich from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nIn Brazil, dancers add the fighting sport of capoeira to their breaking. They move around the floor with straight legs. They create shapes in the air with their arms and legs. They move very smoothly when they dance.\nVoice 2\nIn South Africa, dancers add traditional tribal dance steps to their breaking. They pump their hands in the air. They step their feet hard on the ground. They dance with strength and energy.\nVoice 1\nIn the United States, bboys and bgirls add the sport of gymnastics to their dance. They balance their bodies on their arms. They jump and flip in the air.\nVoice 2\nBreaking is more than just a dance. It is an important way to build community. Around the world people have discovered how this dance can bring people together.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Liz Waid.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where is the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nImagine these situations. A young man is walking in the hills. But he is lost. It is getting dark. The man cannot see anything. He falls and hurts his leg. Now he cannot walk and needs help immediately. But he does not know where he is. He cannot ask anyone to come and help him. He does not know how to tell anyone where to find him.\nVoice 2 \nA young woman is at an outdoor music event. During the event, she is planning to stay in a tent with her friends. She knows which field they are in. So, she walks around the field looking for them. But she cannot find their tent. She does not know how to find the exact position of her friends.\nImage by Leni_und_Tom from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever been in a situation like this? We do not always know where we are — even with modern technology. This can be annoying in some situations. But it can be very dangerous in other situations. Chris Sheldrick has created something that helps people when they face a problem like this. It helps people all over the world who cannot give an address or say where they are. It is called what3words. Today’s Spotlight is on Chris Sheldrick and his app what3words.\nVoice 2 \nChris Sheldrick lives in the United Kingdom. He worked in the music industry for ten years. He organised music events around the world. But every day he had problems with addresses. Musicians and people bringing their equipment often got lost when they tried to find an event. One day in Italy, a driver unloaded equipment at a place one hour north of Rome. But he should have unloaded it one hour south of Rome.\nVoice 1 \nSheldrick tried to get the people he worked with to use longitude and latitude to find where to meet. Marking places like this is exact. But it creates a line of 16 numbers to mark the place. It is too difficult to use. Sheldrick wondered if he could change these numbers into something easier.\nVoice 2 \nSheldrick had a friend who worked with mathematics. The two men worked together on this problem for six months. They found a simple way to talk about where a person was – their location. In a TED talk, Sheldrick explained what they did:\nVoice 3 \n‘We divided the world into three-meter squares. We found that we could name every three-meter square in the world separately with just three words. We used 40,000 words which is more than enough for the trillions of squares.’\nVoice 1 \nSo the men gave every square or place a separate three-word address. For example, their company building in London has the address ‘filled.count.soap’. And the door of the UK Prime Minister is ‘slurs.this.shark.’\nWebsite screen capture\nVoice 2 \nSheldrick called this new system what3words. He built an app people can use to find places this way. He knew that it could do much more than get musicians to the right place. He believed that what3words could help billions of people in the world who still live without an address. He told the Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n‘If you think about addresses, some are from centuries ago. Some are from last week. But there is so much of the world that does not use them. Complete countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, have only ever used directions.’\nVoice 1 \nSheldrick knew that people without an address sometimes struggle to get the same services as people who do have an address. For example, if you do not have an address you will find it hard to get a bank account, be listed to vote or receive a letter. So his company built what3words into many languages from Arabic to Urdu. This means what3words can help people in countries that do not have a good address system. It can help people in life or death situations. It can even help businesses work better.\nImage via what3words.com\nVoice 2 \nIn his TED talk, Sheldrick explained some of the ways that what3words has already been used.\nVoice 3 \n‘In Durban, South Africa, an organisation called Gateway Health provided 11,000 three word address signs in their community. Pregnant mothers can call the emergency services and use the signs to explain exactly where to find them. In the past, the ambulances have often taken hours to find the pregnant mothers. In Mongolia, the National Post Service uses the system. They are now taking mail to many people for the first time. The United Nations are using it to mark photos or pictures in disaster or trouble areas. They can then take aid to exactly the right place. Even Domino’s Pizza use it in the Caribbean. They want to get their food to people while it is still hot.’\nImage via what3words.com\nVoice 1 \nPeople all over the world use the what3words app. It is free to emergency services and individuals. In the United Kingdom, Jess Tinsley and her friends went for a walk. But they got lost. It was dark and wet, and Tinsley was near to tears. She said,\nVoice 4 \n‘We were in a field and had no idea where we were.’\nVoice 2 \nShe got a phone signal and called the emergency services. They told her to use the what3words app.  She quickly did this. The emergency services knew where she was in less than a minute. Soon they found and rescued Tinsley and her friends.\nVoice 1 \nIn Uganda, what3words worked with the Community Development Centre to bring 3word addresses to refugee camps in the area of Arua. The Centre will discover and record 3word addresses for every home and important building in the camp. This means health workers will be able to find people who need medical services. But it means much more than this. Sebit Martin is a leader at the Community Development Centre. On the what3words website, Martin explained why it was important for refugees to have an address.\nVoice 5 \n‘We want to give refugees the self-respect they deserve. We can improve their living conditions. 3word addresses will give everyone an easy way of talking about places. But these addresses are also a better language of hope in the refugee camp.’\nVoice 2 \nDo you have an address? Have you ever had problems finding a place? Would this app help you? Tell us about it.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1\nIt is a warm day in Jakarta, Indonesia. A young woman sits in her car. The traffic is busy.  None of the cars are able to move. The woman looks at the empty driving lane next to her. This space is a special part of the road. It is only for buses and emergency vehicles. As she watches, a car drives past. This car is driving in the special lane. She recognizes the car.  It is the car of a government official named Salim Segaf Aljufri! She holds up her telephone.  She takes a picture. She puts the picture on the Internet using Twitter. Many people see the picture on this social media website. The very next day, the police appear at Aljufri’s office. And they give him a fine for breaking traffic laws!\nVoice 2 \nThe Internet is a powerful tool for communication, learning, and sharing. But it is also a tool for political change. Today’s Spotlight is on how Indonesians are using the Internet to change their government and society.\nVoice 1 \nIndonesia is a large country in Southeast Asia. Over 240 million people live there. For the last 20 years, Indonesia has worked to become a fully democratic state.  Much of that work has been successful. However, many Indonesians still identify problems with their country. Some citizens complain about poor government. Others worry about the country’s lack of security. And still others describe the country’s poor economic situation.\nImage by Joseph Samson from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nMany Indonesians work hard to change these negative issues. Some citizens protest to show their opposition. Others join political movements or work with social organizations to encourage social change. But most recently, Indonesians have been working for change in a new way – by using social media.\nVoice 1 \nIndonesians are major users of social media. They enjoy using these Internet websites to connect with other people. Nearly 17% of Indonesians uses social media websites every day. The most popular social media websites are Twitter and Facebook. And Indonesia has the second highest number of Facebook users in all of Asia.\nVoice 2 \nThis high use of social media has begun to influence how Indonesians encourage change.  More and more people are using social media to share their opinions about social and political issues. Social media helps many Indonesians become involved. It helps them feel like they have power to influence their government. And news spreads more quickly. If a politician says or does something wrong, people can discuss it on social media. And this can change public opinion.\nVoice 1 \nIn October of 2012, social media influenced the actions of the Indonesian President. In the Indonesian government, there is a group called the Corruption Eradication Commission or KPK. The KPK works to find corrupt or dishonest officials. Corrupt officials often accept money or bribes to do illegal things for people. The KPK works to find corruption and punish the people responsible.\nVoice 2\nIn 2012, the KPK was investigating one of the country’s top police officials. The police were not happy with the KPK’s investigation. The police were using their power to block the KPK’s work. This action made many Indonesians angry. They believed the KPK should be able to work freely. So they talked about it on social media.\nVoice 1 \nOn Facebook, people started a “Save KPK” movement. And on Twitter, “Save KPK” became a very popular conversation subject. People criticized the President for being quiet on the issue. The “Save KPK” movement became so popular that news organizations were talking about it!  Soon, the President ordered the police to stop interfering with the KPK investigation. And he said that Indonesians on social media made it clear that he needed to act!\nVoice 2 \nSocial media has also been important for Indonesians who are fighting for their rights. In 2008, Prita Mulyasari had a terrible experience at the hospital. Her doctors treated her poorly. They told her wrong information about her condition. And they ordered tests that were not needed. She was very angry about her experience. When she got home, she wrote an email about it to friends and family.\nImage by Yermia Riezky from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nSome of Mulyasari’s friends sent the email to other people. Soon, it spread all over the Internet. A news organization even reported on it! And Mulyasari’s doctors saw the report. They were angry, too. They did not think Mulyasari should have written negative things about them. So they took her to court. They wanted her to pay money and to go to prison.\nVoice 2 \nMany people in Indonesia believed the doctors were wrong. But, they also thought the doctors would probably win.  They believed this because the doctors had money to pay for a good legal expert. And Mulyasari did not. So, a group of people started a movement on Facebook. The movement raised money to help Mulyasari pay for her court case. Without the power of the Internet, Mulyasari probably would have lost her case.  But in 2012, court officials ruled that Mulyasari was innocent. It was because of social media that Mulyasari did not go to prison for expressing her opinion.\nVoice 1 \nSocial media is a way for people to easily and quickly share their ideas and experiences. Sometimes, this can create action and influence real change. However, it does not always lead to permanent change. In Mulyasari’s case, politicians became involved. Her simple email became a national discussion about health care and the courts. But, court officials did not change any laws. Arjuna Dibley is a writer for the magazine Inside Indonesia. She wrote about the Mulyasari case. She talked about why there was no change in the law. She said:\nVoice 3\n“Today, social media action in Indonesia is concentrated on short messages and quick reaction to new cases. Social media lacks the long term, deep power required to create legal changes. Mulyasari’s case shows that once the early popularity of a particular case is gone, the discussion ‘moves on’ to new issues.  But the difficult, complex and longer term goal of creating legal change remains unanswered.”\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nWhat do you think about social media?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nA woman in the United States is making a meal. She chooses a recipe from a recipe book. She will follow this recipe, adding each different food at the right time to make a good-tasting meal. The recipe begins with common foods. First, she adds some juice from a sour lemon. Then she puts in some olive oil and a small amount of sweet honey. She adds some salt and pepper spice. Finally, she is ready to add the protein, or meat, into the meal. Does the recipe use chicken? Fish? Pork? No, the final ingredient in this recipe is katydids – a kind of insect!\nVoice 2 \nFor many people in the United States insects would be a very surprising ingredient. There, eating insects is not common. But this recipe book is trying to change the way people in the United States and other western countries think about eating insects. This book contains recipes for people to make food from insects. It is called the “Eat-A-Bug Cookbook.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this book is David George Gordon. In his book, he tells about the reasons that people should eat more insects. Eating insects is good for the environment, public health, and also the economy. Today’s Spotlight is on eating insects.\nVoice 2 \nExperts estimate that by 2050 there will be 9 billion people in the world. Almost a billion people already suffer from hunger every day. Our earth has a limited amount of resources like land and water. If we do not have enough food for the people on our earth now, how will we have enough for another 2 billion people in 2050?\nVoice 1 \nThese are the questions that experts around the world are struggling with. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a report in 2013. It explained:\nVoice 3 \n“The problem will be worse in the future. We need to think about what we eat and how we produce it. We need to find new ways of growing food.”\nVoice 2 \nThe report suggested that raising and eating insects was one way people could solve this problem. There are over 1,900 different kinds of insects that people can eat. The most common are beetles and caterpillars.\nVoice 1 \nMany people around the world already eat insects. In fact, insects are part of the traditional diet of over 2 billion people. For example, in China, some people cook insects over a fire. They put the insects on a stick. The cooked insects are served on the street as street food. They are also served in restaurants, where food costs a lot of money. In the country of Ghana, people collect the termite insect in the spring time. They grind the termites into a kind of powder similar to grain. They use the ground termites to make bread.\nVoice 2\nInsects are a part of traditional diets because they are a very healthy food. They contain almost as much protein as a serving of meat from a pig or cow. Protein is a substance all people need to eat to stay healthy. Insects are high in vitamins and minerals. And insects are also low in fat and cholesterol – substances that are necessary for the body, but only in small amounts.\nVoice 1 \nEating insects is also very good for the environment. Insects need fewer resources like land and water than larger animals. 90% of the fresh water people use goes to farming and raising animals.\nVoice 2 \nMarcel Dicke studies insects. In a TED talk, he explained how insects also produce more meat from the food they eat. For example, imagine a farmer. Imagine the farmer feeds a cow 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce about 1 pound of cow meat for people to eat. However, imagine the farmer gives cricket insects 10 pounds of food. Those 10 pounds of food produce 9 pounds of cricket meat for people to eat!\nVoice 1 \nEating more insects can also help people in poorer communities. Many people can raise and sell insects. Raising and selling insects can provide a job and food.\nVoice 2 \nBut insects will not replace livestock meat very quickly. First, people in some countries would have to change how they think about eating insects. Many people in North America and Europe eat a lot of livestock meat like cow and pigs. But they do not traditionally eat insects. They do eat some products of insects, like sweet honey from bees. But it is not normal to eat a whole insect in any form. In fact, for many people in the west, eating insects sounds insane! They believe insects are dirty and dangerous. Insects make people feel uncomfortable.\nVoice 1 \nSome people are trying to solve this problem. For example, we talked about David George Gordon’s recipe book at the beginning of this program. His recipe book tries to show people that eating insects can be delicious and easy. Other insect experts travel and tell people about the great effects of eating insects. But they still have a lot of work to do.\nVoice 2 \nAnother challenge is creating rules and laws for insect producers to follow. There should be rules about how to raise insects safely to eat as food. People also need to decide how to eat insects. Will they be whole? Will they be ground into powder like a grain? Or, will food scientists discover a way to take all of the great food substances from insects and serve them in a very different form? These are all questions that people will have to ask and answer in the near future.\nVoice 1 \nBut there are people who want to answer those questions now. José Andrés is a master chef in the United States. He has won important awards for his cooking. He serves insects in his restaurant. He believes that finding new forms of food is important for the future. He told the New Yorker Magazine:\nVoice 4 \n“We need to feed people in a sustainable way. In the future, the people who know how to produce protein will have an advantage over everyone else.”\nVoice 2 \nWill insects become the world’s main source of protein in the future?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1\nA woman drives a black convertible over a hill. Her hair flows behind her out of this open-roofed vehicle. At the top of the hill, the road bends around sharp rocks. The sea crashes below. And, out above the sea, the sun begins to set. The woman parks her car and looks out over the ocean. The engine of her electric-powered car is quiet. Its sound disappears into the wind.\nVoice2\nCars are everywhere. They take people to remote places. They take people to work and to their homes. Usually, these automobiles are powered by gasoline or petrol. But things were not always this way, and they may not always be either.\nToday’s Spotlight is on the history and future of the automobile.\nVoice 1\nPeople have dreamed about creating cars for a very long time. They wanted a way to transport people and goods without animals. But it took a very long time to make one that worked.\nVoice2\nNicholas Cugnot was a French inventor. He built the first car in the late 1700’s. It used steam to power its engines. And it could drive at speeds of about 7 kilometres per hour. But steam engines were very large. And they took a lot of work to run. Horses cost less money. They could also transport people more quickly. Many other inventors tried to build a smaller steam-powered car that was easier to use. But cars did not become popular until someone invented a different kind of engine.\nVoice 1\nThe engine that powers many of the cars you see on the road today is called an internal combustion engine. Many people helped to create the internal combustion engine. But the first person to use it in a car was Karl Benz, in 1885. Internal combustion engines are smaller than steam engines. They use gasoline to fuel the engine. And they can produce more power to push a car faster.\nVoice2\nThis new engine made cars more popular around the world. But for a long time, only the very wealthy could buy them. Cars cost a lot of money because of the way people made them. One or two people made each car by hand. So cars took a long time to make. Also, each car was different so they cost a lot of money to fix.\nVoice 1\nBut in the early 1900s a man from the United States changed how cars were made. His name was Henry Ford.  Ford was a car engineer. At first, he made cars the traditional way. But he believed he could make them more easily. He did this by designing one car model that many different people could help him make. He used simple parts. Then his workers simply followed the same design plan for every car. He even made the cars all the same color. This let Ford produce many cars that were all the same in a short amount of time.\nVoice2\nFord’s method changed the way industry works around the world. He designed a system that made it easy to produce large amounts of his product. He paid his workers enough money so that they could buy his product. Ford made it possible for many people to buy an car. Ford’s most popular car was called the Model T. By the 1920s, Ford had produced over 15,000,000 Model T cars. Many other car companies also used Ford’s methods. Cars began to cost less money all over the world.\nVoice 1\nBut the number of cars on the road also created a problem. Every car needed gasoline for fuel. Burning gasoline worked very well to power cars. But it also creates a lot of  pollution. The number of cars made some cities difficult to live in. People exposed to too much vehicle pollution develop problems with their breathing.\nVoice2\nBurning gasoline also creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that leads to global climate change. Using gasoline was a great idea when people started making cars. There were not many cars in the beginning, so the pollution did not affect much. But today there are more than one and a half billion cars on the road. The success of the car has turned gasoline use into a danger.\nVoice 1\nKate Brunton is a representative from Amber. Amber is a Dutch car company that makes electric, self-driving vehicles. She spoke to the University Network about the problem of gasoline cars.\nVoice 3\n“The problem is that owning cars, especially cars that use fuel, is bad. But there is no real choice. It is bad for consumers, because the cost of owning most cars is high. It is bad for the environment. It does not work well. Most cars spend 90 percent of their time standing still.”\nVoice2\nToday many car companies are working to make cars that do not need gasoline. For example, many large vehicle manufacturers have begun to produce electric vehicles. Instead of burning fuel, electric vehicles store energy in batteries. For a long time, electric vehicles were not very popular. They could not go very far or very fast. This changed in 2003 with the creation of the Tesla Motor company. Tesla worked for many years to create an electric engine that worked as well as gasoline engines. And, in 2008, they released the Tesla Roadster. The roadster was just as fast as a gasoline-powered car. And it could travel over 300 kilometers on a single charge!\nVoice 1\nAnother newer creation is the hybrid vehicle. Hybrid cars use technology from both gasoline and electric engines. Hybrids have gasoline engines like normal cars. But the engines do not give power to push the car forward. Instead, they give power to the battery. The battery makes the car go forward. You do not need to charge the battery in a hybrid car. The gasoline engine provides the power to the battery. But the battery can power the car at low speeds, so the engine does not have to turn on. Hybrid engines are smaller than gasoline engines. And they require less gasoline to operate.\nVoice2\nOther companies have been experimenting with different fuels. For example, it is possible to fuel a car with hydrogen. Many large car companies are researching this new technology. Right now, it is difficult to use hydrogen because it does not last very long. One tank full of hydrogen may only be able to fuel a car for a very short time. But people are hopeful that new technologies will help make hydrogen work in the future.\nVoice 1\nThere are many possible paths for the future of the car. How we travel has changed many times over the past hundred years. And it will change again. It may be possible that there will be no single replacement for the internal combustion engine. In the future, there may be many different kinds of cars, each with different fuels. Or people may use cars less.  Either way, it is important to continue to invest in these new technologies. It is important not only for the future of the car, but for the future of humanity.\nVoice2\nDo you own a car? What kind of engine does it have? Do you use busses or trains more often?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA man climbs on the rocky side of a mountain. He holds on to a thin rope. He has covered his head and shoulders with a cloth. The man raises a long stick with a sharp point. He is a hunter. But he is not hunting an animal. The man on the mountainside is hunting honey. This sweet food is made by flying insects called bees. The bees fly all around the man. If they sting him, it would be very painful. If he falls down the mountain, he will most likely die. But if he succeeds, he will bring valuable honey home. The honey hunter is taking a big risk. Today’s Spotlight is on honey hunters.\nVoice 2\nIf you walk through an area with many plants, you may see and hear bees. These yellow and black insects fly from flower to flower. They are collecting a liquid called nectar. The bees take the nectar back to their home – called a bee hive.\nVoice 1\nBees make their hives out of wax. The wax hive hangs down from a tree or high rock. And thousands of bees sit on it. All these bees were born in the hive. They live and eat there. The wax of the hive has many holes in it. The bees put the nectar in these holes. Soon, the water evaporates from the nectar, leaving a thick liquid. This liquid is light brown or yellow in colour. It tastes very sweet. It is honey.\nVoice 2\nBees make honey to eat as food. But many other animals like to eat honey too – including people. People have used honey as food and medicine for thousands of years. It is a special food in many cultures. People eat honey to help with sickness such as a cough or throat pain. In many cultures, people also put honey on their skin. It keeps skin soft. Honey breaks down bad bacteria and helps to heal wounds.\nVoice 1\nBut to use honey, people must first collect it. Some people take care of a bee hive. But in some places, people collect honey from wild bees. This is common in many parts of the world, especially south Asia. Honey hunting is a local tradition in southern India. But this traditional custom is not easy. The bees in southern India are large. They can grow up to the size of the smallest adult human finger. And these giant honey bees build their hives on the sides of mountains!\nVoice 2\nIt takes many years for a honey hunter to learn to collect honey from these hives. From a young age the honey hunter learns everything about bees. He practices climbing hundreds of metres above the ground. Then the honey season arrives. The honey hunter prepares for many days. He does not eat meat. He does not sleep with his wife. He stays by himself. The honey hunter must be calm and full of courage.\nVoice 1\nThe day of the honey hunt arrives. Early in the morning, the villagers say prayers. And then the honey hunter goes to the edge of the mountain. He climbs down with a rope made from small tree branches. He lights some dry branches on fire. The smoke makes the bees leave the hive. They fly around the honey hunter. He reaches a long sharp stick over to the hive. He gently cuts off of pieces of the wax filled with honey. He takes them back to the village in a container made of bamboo.\nVoice 2\nWhen the honey hunter returns, the village celebrates! The honey is important to them for many reasons. Simone Gie works for the organization Slow Food International. She writes about the importance of honey:\nVoice 3\n“Tribes have been honey hunting in this way for generations. Rock paintings in the area show honey hunters more than 2,000 years ago. Honey was once a valuable resource in the trading system between tribes. It still is an important part of their diet, cooking and medicine.”\nVoice 1\nThe hunter takes some honey. But he always leaves some of the hive on the mountainside. He does not take the part of the hive with the baby bees in it. He does not want to destroy the home of the bees. There are also areas of the mountain and forest that are considered holy. These places are important for the religion of the tribe. The hunters are careful not to take honey from the holy places.\nVoice 2\nBut this traditional system may not be enough to protect the bees in the future. The forests where the tribes live are changing. People are planting huge tea farms throughout the area. They are spraying chemicals and cutting down trees. This is not good for the plants and animals in the forest. It can kill the bees and destroy their hives. It is also dangerous for the people who live there.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation is a local organization in Southern India. It has worked with the honey hunters for fifteen years. They aim to protect the environment and local culture. Robert Leo works for the Keystone Foundation. He tells the organization Slow Food International:\nVoice 4\n“In the past few years, we have seen many people coming back to forest honey gathering, particularly young people. One of the reasons is that it is now possible to make enough money this way.”\nVoice 2\nMany young people in South India leave the tribal areas. They can make more money working in the city. But for the tribe to continue and grow, they must have young people. So the honey hunters have made a few changes. They found ways for young people to make money in the village. The tribe still uses traditional tools and skills to harvest honey. But they have a new production center. Here, they clean the honey. Then they put it in bottles. This way the tribe can sell their honey for a higher price.\nVoice 1\nThe Keystone Foundation also helped set up some hives for people to keep. People can harvest honey from these hives at any time of year. Then the honey hunters can make money even when it is not the season for wild honey. They can continue their traditions. This provides a future for the honey hunters. And it protects the creatures that make the valuable honey – the giant honey bees.\nVoice 2\nThe writer and producer of this program was Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nImagine the inside of a laboratory. Men and women in white lab coats bend over long tables. One woman is working over a small plastic dish. She takes a small container of liquid and empties it into the dish. Then, she squeezes several drops of a different liquid from a long tube. She seals the dish, and places it in a container with several more dishes.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2\nSix weeks pass. The dishes sit in their container. But inside the dishes, something is happening. Slowly, a red substance starts to grow. By the end of the six weeks, it fills the dish. It looks like a hamburger! But does it taste like one? The woman returns to the laboratory and chooses one dish. She brings it into a kitchen and places the substance on a hot pan. Once it is brown, she puts it between two pieces of bread. Then, she takes a big bite!\nVoice 1\nThis may seem like something from a futuristic film. But the woman has just taken her first bite of lab-grown, or in vitro, meat. Many people think this new technology can help solve many problems in the world of meat production. But will people really eat it? Today’s Spotlight is on in vitro meat.\nVoice 2\nMany people around the world love meat. People eat pigs, chicken, cows, goats, and many other animals. Meat is an important part of the world’s diet. For some, meals with meat are important to who they are. Many regional foods depend on meat for their uniqueness.\nVoice 1\nBut there is also a big problem with meat. Raising animals takes up a lot of space, food, and water. And the global population is increasing. As more people come to live on the earth, they will demand more meat. But the earth may not have enough space to keep these animals. \nVoice 2\nRaising livestock animals also has a serious effect on climate change. Some animals, like cows, goats, and sheep, have special stomachs. These stomachs allow them to eat foods that are very hard to digest, like grasses and leaves. But digesting these foods produces a lot of methane gas. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas. It traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide. And the global meat industry is responsible for 30 percent of the world’s methane production! If the world continues to produce meat like this, it could be very bad for the environment.\nVoice 1\nFor some people, growing meat in laboratories may be the solution to this problem. Meat grown with this method is usually called cultured meat, lab-grown meat, or in vitro meat. To make in vitro meat, all a scientist needs is a few cells from an animal’s muscle. They put these cells in a special environment. Then, they add nutrients, and chemicals called hormones. These chemicals cause the cells to grow. The process does require some things from animals. But a few cells from a cow could grow thousands of pounds of beef. It is much more efficient than raising livestock and it does not produce methane. Liz Specht is the director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. She spoke to the website GEN.\nVoice 3\n“Cultured meat could address all the problems related to industrial meat production. It addresses environmental impacts and concerns about treating animals well. It stops the risks of getting diseases from animals. It can do all this while making sure there is a production system to meet the growth in demand for animal protein.”\nVoice 2\nFor people like Specht, in vitro meat could solve many of our problems. But the technology for in vitro meat is still very new. And it is still very expensive. Mark Post is a Dutch scientist. He was the first person to make a lab-grown hamburger in 2013. It was made from cow cells. The hamburger was very expensive to make. It cost 325,000 dollars! And it took three months to grow. Today, the process is much faster. Good Meats is a company that has started growing in vitro chicken. Their chicken takes only two weeks to produce. But a meal of this chicken will cost about 17 dollars.\nVoice 1\nThe process also may not be as environmentally friendly as people thought. Growing in vitro meat uses a lot of energy. Some of this energy will come from burning fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. And it lasts in the atmosphere longer than methane. So, many people say it is worse for the planet in the long-term.\nVoice 2\nGrowing in vitro meat may also cause a lot of waste. This is because cell cultures must be sterile. They must be free of any bacteria. Otherwise, other things will grow, and ruin the meat. These sterile containers also create a lot of plastic waste. And there is already a problem of too much plastic waste in the environment. \nVoice 1\nBut the biggest question about in vitro meat might be: will people eat it? Many people do not trust food grown in a lab. In vitro meat may seem unnatural. Or people might fear that it will somehow affect their bodies in a bad way. And in vitro meat also does not taste like meat from animals. It does not have fat, only muscle. Fat must be added later, and the taste is still not quite the same.\nVoice 2\nStill, in vitro meat is coming. Today, it is available in very few places. But dozens of companies are working on their meat growing methods. Companies have invested billions of dollars in this research. And many people believe that it is the protein of the future. Josh Tetrick is the CEO of Eat Just, which grows in vitro chicken. He told the website CNET.\nVoice 4\n“I want tens of thousands of restaurants to have cultured meat on their menu. Then, at some point, I want them to ask their chefs, ‘why do we have conventional chicken on the menu, too?’”\nVoice 1\nWould you eat in vitro meat? Why, or why not?

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1\nA city sits on the edge of the North Sea. It is very old . Some of buildings show this age. But many are surprisingly modern. High glass structures mix with ancient churches. And many canals run between these buildings. The Rhine River flows through the center of the city. The city is beautiful. It is like nowhere else in the world.\nVoice 2\nThis city is called Rotterdam. It is the largest city in the country of the Netherlands. And this city has a rich history that goes back over eight hundred years. But Rotterdam also has a problem: it is sinking. In fact, much of the Netherlands is sinking. But why? Today’s Spotlight is on this sinking country.\nVoice 1\nThe Netherlands has a long history of working with water. Over one third of the country is below sea level. In 800 B.C., much of the land was not land at all. It was under water! But soon, people began moving earth into water that was not very deep. They built large mounds higher than the water, called terps. These terps let them build towns and villages. It let them expand toward the sea.\nVoice 2\nOver the years, the Dutch have developed many ways of keeping water out of the land. They built huge walls across lakes and the sea coast. These walls, called dikes, helped them control the water. They kept farmlands from flooding. The Dutch also pumped water out of someareas. The dikes made sure the water would not come back. And people could settle there safely. The Dutch have been able to claim a lot of land using these methods. In the 1960’s they even created a new area. It is called Flevoland.\nVoice 1\nWorking with water is very important to the Netherland’s success. It helped the country to grow. It is still a very small country. But today it is the seventeenth largest economy in the world!\nVoice 2\nBut removing water often has a downside. Much of the Netherlands is built on peat, a special kind of thick decaying plant material. Usually, peat rests on top of water. When the water is gone, it can act like soil. But peat is not very solid. When people put weight on it, it shrinks. When they build on it, the land slowly sinks. This is a process called subsidence. Land subsides naturally in every place on earth. But the process is very slow. Normally, land will sink only three micrometers a year. That is about the thickness of a piece of paper. But in the Netherlands, it is happening very quickly. In some places, the land is sinking over two centimeters each year!\nVoice 1\nFor the people of Rotterdam, this is a very big problem. Many buildings there are very old. Some were built hundreds of years ago. They do not have good foundations. When the ground subsides, those foundations can break. If people do not do something, the buildings may fall over.\nVoice 2\nBut there is another reason why the country sinking is a problem: climate change. All over the world, sea levels are rising. This means that more areas of the Netherlands will be below sea level. And, they will be more at risk from flooding. Whole cities will be in danger. It will become harder and harder to keep them above water.\nVoice 1\nBut the people of the Netherlands are not giving up. Instead, they are making plans for the future. Some believe that the old methods will still work. The Dutch could continue to build dikes and pump water. But as sea levels rise, the cost of this method will go up as well.\nVoice 2\nInstead, the Dutch are doing something different. They are not completely keeping the water out. They are letting some in. They call this the “Room for the River” program. In this program, the Dutch ask people to leave some low areas near rivers. Or, they repurpose public places. If there is a flood, these areas will fill first. They will keep water out of larger cities and towns. Hans Docter is a Dutch ambassador. He spoke to Haaretz news service about the effort.\nVoice 3\n“That’s the idea of living with the sea. Living with the water. In the past, we tried to keep the water out as much as we could. Now, we join it much more to our living areas.”\nVoice 1\nThe Room for the Rivers project is part of a larger movement in the Netherlands. Subsidence and climate change are already happening. The country will get lower. And water levels will rise. It will be impossible to stop the water completely. So, the Dutch are changing their lives. They are trying to live with the new situation.\nVoice 2\nIn some places, these changes have already begun. Stan Fleerakkers is a farmer from the Netherlands. The government bought his farm as part of the room for the river project. But Fleerakkers did not want to move. So, the government built a large terp in the area. Fleerakkers moved his farm onto the terp. Now, when the area floods, there is water in his old farmland. But he is living high above it.\nVoice 1\nMany more people may soon live like Fleerakkers. The Dutch may build the land up instead of keeping the water out. Or, they may make their homes with new building standards. Some people may even build their houses on columns or pillars. These tall posts will hold the building above the ground. When water comes, it will go under. The land will still flood. But the flood will not harm anyone. In Rotterdam, buildings are already made to hold or be above water.\nVoice 2\nThese efforts are very expensive. But in the Netherlands, it may be worth it. Fleerakkers spoke to the magazine Politico:\nVoice 4\n“It is not as expensive as when a village is flooded. We spend a lot of money in Holland on water management. We have to do it. If we do not, we will be flooded. There will be no factories. No people will live here. It will all be gone.”\nVoice 1\nMany other countries will soon need to think about these solutions themselves. As climate change gets worse, many other cities will be in danger of flooding. Cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and New Orleans are already dealing with the problem. No country can solve climate change by themselves. Everyone must work together to handle the issue. But many countries may look to the Netherlands as an example. They have a long history of dealing with water. That history may be just what the future needs.\nVoice 2\nDo you live in a place threatened by climate change?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Ruby still sleeps in the basket. She sleeps with her soft plaything. She likes to have both hands and feet holding something when she is lifted. Do you want to hold her?”\nVoice 1\nDiedre de Villiers is talking about a baby. But Ruby is not a human baby. She is a small furry animal – a koala. De Villiers is a koala researcher. She is caring for Ruby. De Villiers rescued Ruby from the mouth of a dog. And Ruby is sick. De Villiers will care for her until she is healthy. Then Ruby will be able to live in the trees with other wild koalas. Today’s Spotlight is on these koalas.\nVoice 2\nPeople often call koalas “koala bears.” A koala does look like a small size bear. Like a bear, it is covered with grey hair or fur. It has large ears, wide eyes and a long black nose. A koala has a round furry body like a bear. But a koala is not a bear – it is a marsupial.\nVoice 1\nMarsupials are animals that have a special way to carry their newborn babies. They have a pouch. The fur on their stomach can open to hold something – a bit like a bag. The koala mother carries her new baby in this pouch. This makes it easier for her to climb trees. Koalas spend most of their lives up in a tree. They eat tree leaves. Koalas particularly like the shiny, dark leaves of the eucalyptus tree.\nVoice 2\nEucalyptus trees grow in Eastern Australia. This is the home of the koalas too. Around the year 1800, Europeans settled in Australia. At this time, there were probably millions of koalas in Eastern Australia. The number is much smaller now. The Australian Koala Foundation says there are only about forty to eighty thousand koalas left. This sounds like a big number. However, koalas are in serious danger.\nVoice 1\nThe human population of Australia is growing. As people build more roads and houses, they cut down eucalyptus trees. But the koalas need these trees to survive. Trees provide shelter, food and safety for the koalas. Humans also build fences, drive vehicles and own dogs. These things can all be dangerous to a koala. Diedre de Villiers tells National Geographic:  “Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying. They are killed by dogs and hit by vehicles. They are even dying from simple things – like a person who cuts down several eucalyptus trees around his house.”\nVoice 2\nPeople also bring something else that harms koalas – disease. Koalas can die from human disease. It causes another problem too. Disease can change their behaviour. It can make koalas fight each other. Diseases can also make koalas unable to produce babies. This is a big problem because the number of koalas is shrinking. Many people are worried that soon there may be no koalas at all.\nVoice 1\nJoel Sartore is a photographer for National Geographic Magazine. He is very famous for his pictures of rare or endangered animals. He visited Eastern Australia to take pictures of koalas. Sartore took one particularly difficult picture. It was a picture of all the koalas that had died in one area during one week. The picture shows the bodies of thirteen koalas. Sartore tells National Geographic about it:\nVoice 4\n“I knew I had to get a picture of dead koalas for this story. But I kept having trouble. People at the animal clinic I was working with said it would look bad. The Australian government does not even like to say that these koalas are endangered. But the workers at one place I visited thought this was an important picture to make. They told me that in this area these animals will be completely gone in three to five years. They want the world to know that.”\nVoice 2\nThe koala has many enemies such as disease, dogs and people cutting down trees. But koalas have many friends too. Many people are working to protect the koalas from danger. People like Deidre de Villiers take care of hurt koalas. Some people even work with koalas in their own houses.\nVoice 1\nSamantha Longman is one of these people. She takes care of koala babies. She is like their mother! The baby koalas climb on her. They depend on her. She tells National Geographic about this work:\nVoice 5\n“It does not leave me much time for anything else! But the little creatures are part of our family. What we are doing is important.”\nVoice 2\nSome people work with the government to protect land and trees. The Australian Koala Foundation, or AKF, is asking the government to use more land as natural park areas. These parks would be a good place for koalas to live. The AKF would also like the government to create laws to protect koalas. They want to stop people from cutting down eucalyptus trees. Without eucalyptus trees, the koalas can not survive. The AKF website explains:\nVoice 6\n“Eighty percent of the land that koalas live on is on privately owned. It is often farmland – not in national parks. This is why the AKF wants a law that will prevent people from cutting down trees on their land. We want a law to encourage people to protect and manage the land where koalas live.”\nVoice 1\nThere is another way de Villiers works to protect koalas. She watches wild koalas. This way she can learn how the koalas are doing. She studies their health. And she studies the population growth of koalas in the area.\nVoice 2\nHumans have caused many problems for koalas in Australia. But de Villiers says that people and koalas can live together. People can make some changes that would help the koalas. They can drive more slowly. They can make sure that there are enough eucalyptus trees for the koalas to live in and eat.\nVoice 1\nOn one trip de Villiers studied Tee Vee – a koala she had watched for over a year.  To her surprise, de Villiers discovered Tee Vee had a young baby in her pouch. De Villiers shared her excited reaction with National Geographic:\nVoice 3\n“While there are still healthy babies, there is still hope.”\nVoice 2\nThe voices you heard were from the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 3\n“Lots of people say – how can you work out in the wild when you are a woman? But I can do anything I want.  Many other people, especially young women like us, they want to join us. I am a woman. I am going to have a baby. I want my baby to see a rhino. That is why I am protecting it.”\nVoice 1\nLeitah Michabela said this to The Guardian newspaper. Michabela is part of a group in South Africa called The Back Mambas. They work to protect wild animals, particularly one special animal – the rhinoceros, or rhino. Today’s Spotight is on The Black Mambas of South Africa.\nVoice 2\nSouth Africa is a large and beautiful country. Like many countries, it has some special areas that are kept only for nature. People do not live in these game parks or reserves. The areas are separated to protect the plants and animals there. These include large elephants, tigers, lions, and many kinds of smaller animals too. Rhinos also live there. These large grey animals have large pointed horns on their face.\nVoice 1\nRhinos are protected by the laws of the country. But people still hunt them. Some people think that the rhino horn has special powers. They will pay a lot of money for it. Because of this, people illegally kill, or poach, rhinos in South Africa’s game reserves. Now, there are not many rhinos left. If people do not stop killing them, in ten years, there will be none.\nVoice 2\nIn Kruger National Park in South Africa, the park officials have worked for a long time to stop poachers. Like other National Parks, they employed male rangers with guns to patrol the park. These rangers would shoot or arrest anyone that they found trying to kill the rhinos. The punishment for poaching a rhino is up to 20 years in prison. There is also a fine of over $100,000.\nVoice 1\nBut even with punishments and armed rangers, the rate of rhino deaths in Kruger Park was still very high. Authorities needed another solution to save the rhinos. So they formed a new group in a nearby area called Balule Nature Reserve. This group has reduced trapping and poaching in their area by 76 percent!\nVoice 2\nThis new force is made up only of women. They are named the Black Mambas after a deadly kind of snake. The Black Mambas do not carry guns. Instead they concentrate on protecting the animals and natural environment in the Park. Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Black Mambas. She explains to The Guardian why her group is so important.\nVoice 4\n“There were men rangers carrying guns. But still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached.\nI think they said, ‘Let us start something and add women and see what happens.’ Women are more loyal to their jobs. So they feel very strongly about what they do.”  \nVoice 1\nIn 2013 the Park employed 26 women from the surrounding community. The Women come from poor communities around the Park. Before they begin, they receive military training and wildlife education. They learn methods to follow poachers’ footprints and to take apart traps.\nVoice 2\nSince 2013, the Mambas have patrolled the metal fence which marks the Park area. They watch for poachers. They remove traps, or snares, set by poachers. And they report everything they see. The Mambas also go into the community. There, they educate people, especially children, about protecting animals.\nVoice 1\nAnd the women of the Black Mambas have made a big difference. The Guardian says in the six months before they began, 16 rhinos were killed in Balule. In the year after the Black Mambas started, only three rhinos were killed. Siphiwe Sithole says:\nVoice 4\n“The Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching. We have zero acceptance of rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”\nVoice 2\nPeople all over the world have noticed the Black Mambas’ success. The New York Times published pictures of them. They won an award from the UK organization Helping Rhinos. And the UN gave them the Champions of the Earth prize in 2015 for their courage. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Achim Steiner said:\nVoice 5\n“Their many successes are a result of their great courage and strong desire to make a difference in their community. The Black Mambas are an inspiration, not only locally, but across the world to all those working to stop the ugliness of the illegal wildlife trade.”\nVoice 1\nWinning awards like this shows people that it is possible to prevent poaching. It also shows local people that the Black Mambas are valuable. Mamba Felicia Mogakane explains:\nVoice 6\n“It is about knowing that people in South Africa love and are thankful fo what we are doing. They are so happy that there are Mambas. Some years ago, they used to say this job is for men. Now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to su and makes us continue to do our job when we know that people are behind us, supporting us. If I were not doing this, I would we sitting at home without a job. Jobs are limited in South Africa. So this is a big chance for me because I am able to take care of my family.”\nVoice 2\nThe Black Mambas are doing important work to save rhinos. But they are also doing important work in their communities. They are supporting their families by earning money. And people respect and honour them because of the work that they do. The Black Mambas show that communities and nature can work together. They bring hope for both people and animals in South Africa. We close our program today with the words of another Mamba, Collette Ngobeni, who share her hope for the future:\nVoice 7\n“If we work together as a community, we can solve this problem. People need to open their minds and their hearts. It is not about money. It is about our culture, our future.”\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are walking through a forest full of pine trees. A thin layer of snow covers the branches. And underneath, the hills are layered with mounds of snow and ice. It is hard to walk through. But the air is fresh, and the cold makes you feel alive. It is one of the most beautiful winter days you could think of.\nVoice 2\nBut a day like this can also turn deadly. Freezing temperatures can cause serious injury, and even death. The Lancet Planetary Health is a medical journal. In 2021, they published a study led by a team of researchers in Australia and China. The study found that almost half a million people die from extreme heat every year. But over four and a half million people die from extreme cold every year. More than half of the deaths from extreme cold were in eastern and southern Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa also had the highest cold-related death rate by population.\nVoice 1\nPeople often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in cold weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Today’s Spotlight is on how to stay safe in cold weather.\nVoice 2\nOne of the biggest dangers of the cold is called hypothermia. A person gets hypothermia when their body temperature gets too low. The human body naturally regulates its own temperature. When it is too hot, we sweat. When it is too cold, our bodies try to make heat. When a person is in the cold, it is almost like they are exercising. Their body is working extra hard to keep the temperature at the right level.\nVoice 1\nBut sometimes, the body cannot create heat fast enough. Or, it has no more energy to use. When this happens, the body’s temperature begins to drop. Soon after, the brain stops working correctly. This is one of the first signs of hypothermia. A person with hypothermia may have a difficult time remembering things. They may be confused, tired, or have a difficult time moving. This makes it even more difficult to get help.\nVoice 2\nHypothermia usually happens when a person is out in the cold for too long or they are not wearing enough clothing. Without proper clothing, the body will lose heat even more quickly. Strong wind can also lead to hypothermia. If it is very windy, the air will carry off heat from the body faster. This is why windy weather feels colder than it actually is. It causes us to lose more heat.\nVoice 1\nWhen a person has hypothermia, it is important to help them as soon as possible. Here is how you can do that. Bring them inside into a warm room. If they are awake, make them a warm drink. Try to warm the center of their body first: the chest, neck, head, and groin. Keep the person dry. If they have wet clothes, remove them. When a person is wet, their body will lose heat faster. Keep them wrapped in dry blankets. And most importantly, get them emergency help.\nVoice 2\nBeing in the extreme cold can also lead to frostbite. Frostbite is an injury where part of a person’s body freezes. When this happens, the water in their body turns into ice crystals. These crystals damage the body parts. And they make it impossible for blood to flow. Frostbite usually affects the body’s smaller parts like toes, fingers, cheeks, nose, and ears. A person who has frostbite will not be able to feel the affected area. The skin will get hard and change color. In extreme cases, frostbite can damage organs and skin.\nVoice 1\nIf you have never been in the cold, it can be difficult to understand the unique pain of frostbite. It is like being burned. But you are being burned by the cold. With very bad cases of frostbite, a person might not even feel it. Sir Ranulph Fiennes is a famous explorer who once had a bad case of frostbite. He was exploring in the artic when his supplies fell in the water. He had to reach in to pull them out. He told the magazine Esquire what happened next:\nVoice 3\n“The water was not all that cold. It was probably about 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But when I got my arm out of the water, it started getting cold very quickly. My fingers felt like dead wood. I could not bend them.”\nVoice 2\nSir Fiennes had fourth-degree frostbite in his fingers. There are four different types, or degrees, of frostbite. A person with a fourth-degree frostbite may never feel the affected area again. The area may die. In the most extreme cases, it may even fall off. In Sir Fiennes’ case, he lost most of his fingers. He was very lucky to not lose his hand.\nVoice 1\nIf someone has frostbite, it is very important to get them to a warm place. Place the affected area in warm water. Keep the area protected. Do not touch the area with frostbite. Moving or rubbing the area can cause more damage. When the area has warmed again, give the person pain medication. When blood returns to a frostbitten area, it can be very painful. You should also get them emergency care. Doctors may be able to save an area from dying.\nVoice 2\nMany people may not recognize symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite. But it is important to know how to prevent them. Here are some suggestions on how to stay safe in cold weather:\nVoice 1\nWear layers of clothing and cover all areas of skin. Wearing the proper clothing is very important in cold weather. It will keep the heat of your body close to your body. And clothing will protect you from the wind. It is very important to cover your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. These areas keep the least heat. They are very vulnerable to frostbite.\nVoice 2\nKeep yourself dry. If you are sweating in cold weather, you may be wearing too much. Take off a layer of clothing. You will still be protected, but you will not be wet.\nVoice 1\nAvoid drinking alcohol when you are in the cold for a long time. Alcohol opens up a person’s blood vessels. Blood will rush away from the important parts of a person’s body. Blood carries heat. So, a person will lose heat in the important areas of the body.\nVoice 2\nKnow your body. Some people may suffer more from the cold. These include older people, and people with bad circulation. These people should avoid being out in the cold for too long.\nVoice 1\nFinally, keep active. The body warms in the cold naturally. Staying active will help keep the body warm.\nVoice 2\nDo you have experience with the cold? What tips or tricks do you have to stay warm? You can leave a comment on our website at www.spotlightenglish.com. You can also find us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\nVoice 1\nThe writer of this program was Dan Christmann.

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nImagine you are in a meeting at an office building. Your boss is speaking about next week’s project. Then, everyone takes a break for lunch. But you do not go to a restaurant or store. Instead, you exit the room. Inside the walls of the building are thousands of plants. Some produce fruit, some produce salad greens. You grab a small plate, go to the wall, and pick the ingredients for your lunch. Then, you sit down under a tree and begin to eat. You are 30 stories above the ground.\nVoice 2\nThis may seem like a fantasy. But this describes plans for a real building called the Jian Mu tower. It will be built in Shenzhen, a city in southern China. And it may represent the future of cities. Today’s Spotlight is on the Jian Mu tower and the future of cities.\nVoice 1\nThe Jian Mu tower is a kind of vertical farm. It is not the first vertical farm. Vertical farming is already happening in some countries. The country with the most vertical farms is the United States. But there are vertical farms in many countries, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UAE. Many of them grow leafy green vegetables like lettuce and kale. Economic experts consider vertical farming a growing market. But the Jian Mu is one of the biggest planned projects.\nA vertical farm; CC BY-SA 3.0\nVoice 2\nThe Jian Mu tower will be a tall glass skyscraper. It will be 51 stories tall. It was designed to have offices and apartments. But it is also designed to grow plants. Each window will be filled with them. And the building will produce 270,000 kilograms of food every year!\nVoice 1\nCarlo Ratti is an Italian architect. He designed the Jian Mu Tower. He named it after a tree from old Chinese myth. In the story, this tree connected heaven and earth. Ratti designed the tower for the Chinese grocery business, Wumart. The tower will be Wumart’s new headquarters. But people can also rent rooms there. Each person living in the Jian Mu tower will have their own garden.\nVoice 2\nBut these are not just any gardens. They are vertical gardens. And the whole tower is one big vertical farm. Vertical farms are different than traditional farms. Traditional farms need soil to help plants grow. But vertical farms use methods like hydroponics. These methods give water and nutrients to the plants directly. They do not need soil.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming also lets farmers put plants anywhere. In a vertical farm, farmers hang plants above and beside each other on a wall. Sometimes, they use special lights to help the plants grow. Others, like the Jian Mu tower, hang plants by windows. The tower is so high, the plants get plenty of sun. Doing this also has another benefit: When plants take in sunlight, they also take in heat. This helps control the climate in the tower. So, the tower will use less energy.\nVoice 2\nVertical farms can be very efficient. Traditional farms can only grow food at some times of the year. But vertical farms can grow plants all year. Some vertical farms trap rainwater. They can recycle the water they use. So droughts – or reduced rain – do not affect the farms. The Jian Mu tower will even get moisture from the air. But vertical farms are a very good use of space. They use far less land than a traditional farm. Brian Moeljadi is the manager of a vertical farm. He told Spectrum News:\nVoice 3\n“With the area of growing, you usually expand out. But with this, you are expanding up. You use less water and land. And you create less waste. It is a more sustainable way to farm.”\nA traditional lettuce farm; Image by NT Franklin from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nToday, environmental experts encourage people to use land efficiently. They want people to use natural resources in the best way possible, with the least amount of waste. Land efficiency will be especially important as the world’s population grows. Dickson Despommier is a former professor at Columbia University. He invented the modern idea of vertical farming. He talked to the website Big Think.\nVoice 4\n“We expect the human population to increase. So, over the next 40 years, you might have three billion more people to feed. And you look around for the land where that food will come from, and you do not find it. It is not there. So, the biggest problem facing the global population is: Where will the food for the next three billion people come from? So, it could come from someplace other than a traditional farm. The question is, could vertical farms solve that problem?”\nVoice 2\nEfficient use of space is important for another reason. It helps fight climate change. According to the World Health Organization, over 50 percent of the world lives in cities. But most of our food does not come from cities. It comes from the country. This means that people living in cities must ship food into the city. The food must come from even farther if it is not in season. Some fruits, like avocados, can travel for thousands of miles before people buy them. This uses a lot of fuel. Food producers must also use preservatives to keep the food fresh. This damages the environment. It also adds to climate change.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming might help reduce these problems. A traditional farm cannot fit in a city. But a vertical farm can! The Jian Mu tower shows that even if you live in the city, there can be a farm in your home. Much of the food people eat in the tower will come from the tower itself. They will not have to go anywhere to get it. They will not have to ship as much food in. And the food will be grown without pesticides or preservatives. It will be better for the people and the environment.\nVoice 2\nVertical farming can even help in places where people cannot grow food. Fukushima is a city in Japan. It once had several nuclear power plants. In 2011 there was a big earthquake. The earthquake caused a tsunami. This huge wave hit Japan and caused terrible damage. The power plants in Fukushima melted down. This contaminated the area with radiation. People could not go there without getting very sick. People in Japan were very scared of the radiation. They did not want to eat food grown anywhere near Fukushima. So, the government funded vertical farming. These new farms were safer than traditional ones. They allowed people to have fresh food, without fear of radiation.\nVoice 1\nVertical farming is not a perfect solution to these problems. A vertical farm can cost a lot of money to build and run. Some vertical farms use lights to grow plants. They also keep their plants in controlled climates. This uses a lot of energy. It can even lead to more pollution, making climate change worse.\nA vertical farm that uses lights; By ifarm.fi – iFarm_salads_small.jpg, CC BY-SA 4.0\nVoice 2\nBut many people believe that they can overcome these problems. They believe buildings like Jian Mu tower will help. Carlo Ratti even believes that buildings like this are the future of cities. He writes:\nVoice 5\n“This approach will be a big part of the design of future cities. It is an answer to one of today’s most difficult building design challenges. That is: How do we bring the natural world into building design?”\nVoice 1\nWould you live in a place like the Jian Mu tower? Would you like to work in one?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1 \nStorms. Floods. Mudslides. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. Most people know about the dangers of these natural disasters. But there is another natural disaster that can be just as dangerous as any of these. It is the heat wave.\nVoice 2 \nHeat waves can have deadly results. The World Health Organization says that between 1998 and 2017 over 160,000 people died because of extreme temperatures. But even without a heat wave, hot weather can be very dangerous. Working outside in the hot sun can affect people more than they know.\nVoice 1 \nPeople often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in hot weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of hot weather. Today’s Spotlight is on how people can stay safe in hot weather.\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nA heat wave is a period of hot weather that lasts for several days. Heat waves are common. Some heat waves last only a few days, but heat waves can last much longer. Heat waves are the most dangerous when they last for more than a few days.\nVoice 1 \nExperts say that heat causes the most damage when outside temperatures stay high day to night. The middle of the day is usually the hottest. And then at night the temperature is cooler. A healthy person’s body can adapt, or change, during the day so that hot weather is not as dangerous to his body. Then, at night when the temperature is cool, his body can rest from the heat. But, if the temperature does not cool down at night, this causes serious problems for his body. His body has no time to recover.\nVoice 2 \nThe human body reacts to heat through its own cooling system. When we get too hot, our skin begins releasing water on its surface. This sweat on the outside of the body evaporates into the air. As the sweat evaporates off the body, the person gets cooler.\nVoice 1 \nThis natural cooling system works well for short periods of time. But it is possible for a person to release too much water as sweat. If he does not put enough water back into his body, he could become dehydrated. Dehydration is one of the most common problems in hot weather or a heat wave. Someone who is dehydrated may have trouble thinking or working. This is because lack of water affects the working of the brain.\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\nVoice 2 \nSomeone who is dehydrated should avoid working too hard and sweating. He needs to put water back into his body. So, he should also drink lots of water. If he does not, his dehydration could lead to more serious problems.\nVoice 1 \nThere are three main illnesses that come from extreme heat. These are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\nVoice 2 \nHeat cramps are quick painful muscle movements that a person cannot control. A person can get heat cramps when she is in very hot weather and has not had enough water. They are most common when a person has also been doing a lot of physical activity. If a person has heat cramps, you should move her to a cool place. Then give her plenty of liquids. A sports drink is a good choice. But coconut water, milk, or water are also very good in this situation.\nVoice 1 \nHeat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. A person with heat exhaustion may have cool wet skin. He may sweat a lot and feel dizzy or faint. He may feel as if he will be sick or have a headache. His heart will beat quickly, but weakly. He may even fall to the ground. If it is not treated, it can be very serious.\nVoice 2 \nHeat exhaustion can develop quickly. But it may also develop slowly over a few days. Often, the victim may not even observe the changes and problems happening in his body.\nVoice 1 \nDuring heat exhaustion, his body is trying to make his body temperature normal again. You can help his body cool down. A person with heat exhaustion should immediately stop working. He should rest in a cool place. They should remove any warm clothing. You can give him cool, wet clothes to put on his skin. And most importantly, he should drink liquids like sports drinks, coconut water, milk, or water.\nVoice 2 \nIf heat exhaustion goes untreated, it may develop into heatstroke. This is the most damaging and dangerous problem that comes from hot weather. During heatstroke a person’s average body temperature rises to over 40 degrees Celsius.\nVoice 1 \nOne sign of heatstroke is that the person becomes confused. He may not be able to answer simple questions. The person’s skin may be dry and red or lighter than normal. He may feel as if he will be sick. And he may take short fast breaths and have a fast but quiet heartbeat.\nVoice 2 \nIf his body temperature rises above 42 degrees, his body will even begin to damage his organs. This can result in permanent brain damage or even death. A person suffering from heat stroke must get treatment immediately.\nVoice 1 \nIf you think someone is suffering from heat stroke, it is very important to help them. Here is what you can do. Remove the person from the heat. Take off his clothes and pour cool water over his body. The water will begin to evaporate and help to cool him down. Place a cool, wet cloth on his skin under his arms and on his neck. Blood vessels are very close to the skin in these areas. The cloth will help to cool his blood and his body. Make sure you get emergency help as soon as you can.\nVoice 2 \nMany people may not recognize these signs of heat sicknesses. But it is important to know what they are and how to treat them. Here are some more suggestions about how to stay safe in hot weather:\nVoice 1 \nTry to stay out of the sun. Use a sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun. Sun can badly burn a person’s body. This affects your body’s ability to cool itself. If you are in the sun and begin to feel sick, find a cool place immediately.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIn 2004, a news reporter had a special story on Chinese television. The news reporter talked with a six-year-old girl. The reporter’s name was Chai Jing. Chai worked for China Central Television. She was reporting in the village of Xiaoyi in the highly-polluted area of Shanxi. Shanxi has many coal plants, and the air is very dirty. Chai asked the little girl in Xiaoyi:\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen a real star?\nVoice 4 \nNo.\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen blue sky?\nVoice 4 \nI have seen sky that was a little blue.\nVoice 3 \nHave you ever seen white clouds?\nVoice 4 \nNo.\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing could not forget about this little girl. Ten years later, she made a documentary film about air pollution in China. She called it “Under the Dome.” Chai released her film on Saturday, February 28th, 2015. In three days, people had watched it more than 150 million times. In one week, people had watched it more than 300 million times. Around one fifth of China’s population has seen it! Today’s Spotlight is on the Under the Dome film.\nScreenshot from the documentary film Under the Dome by Chai Jing, showing pollution in Chengdu in 2014.By Source (WP:NFCC#4), Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=45627907\nVoice 1 \nLess than 10 years after Chai talked with the little girl in Xiaoyi, she had her own baby girl. In fact, having her baby was the main reason she made the film. Chai was worried about her child. Chai lived in Beijing with her daughter. The air there is very polluted. Chai was careful with her daughter. She did not let her daughter play outside her house very often. Chai knew that one day, her little girl would ask her, “Mommy, why did you not let me outside to play?” Chai wanted to have answers for her daughter. She spent her own money making the film. And she took a year researching three questions: One: What is pollution? Two: Where does it come from? And three: What can we do about it.\nVoice 2 \nIn the film, Chai performed an experiment. In her home city of Beijing, she wore a pollution measuring device. She wore the device for 24 hours – one whole day. The device measured the kinds and amounts of pollutant chemicals in the air. Chai wore the device to her normal places, for her normal daily activities. The results of her experiment were shocking. In 24 hours on a normal day, Chai breathed in five times the legal amount of pollutants in China. And China’s legal limits are three times as high as the World Health Organization’s advised limits. Chai is especially concerned about Benzo[a]pyrene. This poisonous chemical causes cancer. On the day of the experiment, Chai breathed in 14 times the legal limit of Benzo[a]pyrene.\nVoice 1 \nChina does have laws about pollution. It also has a Ministry of Environmental Protection, or MEP. In 2012, the government created an “Air Pollution Prevention Plan.” Officials began to measure and announce the amounts of pollutants in the air. But Chai’s film shows one of the main problems. No one enforces the laws against pollution.\nVoice 2 \nIn one part of the film, Chai is with MEP officials. They are driving on the road, and they see a truck with a black cloud around it. The cloud is so large Chai thinks something is on fire. But it is just the pollution coming from the truck. So Chai and the MEP officials follow the truck. They want to see where the truck is getting its fuel. Chai and the MEP officials find a public fuel station. They ask the owner if they can test the quality of the gas. The owner refuses. He takes their MEP identification and will not give it back. Chai protests. She tells the owner that the MEP officials have the responsibility and the authority to test the fuel. The owner says,\nVoice 5 \n“You have the responsibility, but not the authority.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nThis, Chai says, is the problem. Every day, individuals and businesses break environmental laws in China. But no one is punished. One MEP official told her,\nVoice 6 \n“We do the required steps. There is nothing we can do if the businesses do not stop. This is a kind of helplessness.”\nVoice 1 \nThe film “Under the Dome” was on the internet in China for one week. After that, the Chinese government began to block it on the internet. But it still had influence. After three weeks, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang talked publicly about enforcing pollution laws. He said,\nVoice 7 \n“Last year I said that the Chinese government would declare a war against environmental pollution. This year we will work to make sure that the new environmental protection laws are enforced.”\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing’s film had a particular goal. The film asks the government to force factories and businesses to announce their pollution levels. These pollution levels should be public information. She also tells people to report broken rules to the MEP.\nVoice 1 \nIn one part of the film, Chai gives an example of this. The building where she lives has a food restaurant. Every day, cooking smoke comes out of the restaurant. Chai thought this was normal. But then she discovered that there is a rule about cooking smoke. All restaurants should have smoke filters to block their pollution. So she called the MEP. Very shortly, the MEP put a smoke filter in the restaurant. After that, the smoke problem was solved. Chai said,\nVoice 3 \n“When the pollution was bad, I did not know where I would be tomorrow, or where I would be in the future. But when the restaurant owner put in the smoke filter, I felt like my feet had landed on solid ground.”\nVoice 2 \nChai Jing was happy when she saw the restaurant owner using the smoke filter. She knew that the difference to Beijing’s air pollution was very small. But she said,\nVoice 3 \n“One person knows that because they did one small thing, the situation improved a little bit. So when you look back at the war between people and pollution, you see this is how history is made. It is tens of millions of ordinary people. One day they say ‘No. I am not satisfied. I do not want to wait. I will stand up and do something. I will do it right now. At this time, at this place. I am going to do it.’”\nPollution in a city; Image by Ralf Vetterle from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nSusan Saunders was just a young mother. But her own mother began to suffer from dementia. Dementia is not a disease. It is a general loss of skills such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. A person with dementia cannot do normal things on their own. This can happen for several medical reasons. Saunders knew that she did not want her own daughters to have to watch her getting old this way. She began to research how to stay healthy while growing old. She told the news website The Guardian,\nVoice 3 \n“I decided to do everything I could to increase my chances of aging well.”\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nSome people say that age is just a number. But everyone grows old. As people age, their bodies and minds change. They are not able to move as fast or be as strong as they once were. Sometimes people get diseases that they cannot prevent. However, there are things people can do to get the best chance of living a long and healthy life. Today’s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life as you grow old.\nVoice 1 \nIn many ways, what people need in their lives is always the same. People need to eat good food. They need to avoid smoking and other harmful things. However, older people may need to do a little more. They need to be more careful because they may not recover quickly if something goes wrong.\nA glass of water; Image by Ulrike Leone from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe first tip to living well is to drink enough water.  There are three reasons why drinking water is important as people age. First, as people grow older their bodies begin to contain less water. Second, the kidneys stop working as well. These organs clean the body’s water. And third, research shows that older people do not feel thirsty as soon as younger people.\nVoice 1 \nUnder good conditions this is usually not a big problem. But if there is a medical problem that leads to blood loss, or even a very hot day, older people can become dehydrated and sick. In fact, in France during the summer of 2003 over 14,000 people died because of causes related to not drinking enough water. Most of these people were old people.\nVoice 2 \nThe second tip for healthy living is to spend time outside. Scientists are discovering that being outside has many health benefits. Fresh air and sunshine improve lungs and skin. It can also reduce stress. But as people grow old, they may not be able to walk as well. People can struggle to get outside, especially if there is snow or ice. Older people can sometimes spend weeks or months without going outside. But research shows that even 30 minutes outside can make a big difference to a person’s health and attitude.\nAn older couple spend some time outside; Photo by RODNAE Productions from Pexels\nVoice 1 \nThe third tip to living a healthy life as you get older is to think about the past in a healthy way. The average length of life is different depending on where in the world you live. But all aging people understand that they have less time left to live. This can make them ask a lot of questions. Erik Erikson was a famous psychologist. He developed a series of steps of human life. Kendra Cherry wrote about Erikson’s work for the website VeryWellMind.com. She writes:\nVoice 4 \n“Success at this older time of life means that people are able to look back at their life with a sense of happiness. They can face the end of life with a sense of wisdom and no regrets. Erikson defined this wisdom as an “informed and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself.” Those who feel proud of their achievements will feel a sense of wholeness. These individuals will get wisdom, even when looking at death. Those who are not successful during this time of life will feel that their life has been wasted. They will experience many regrets. This person will be left with feelings of bitterness and no hope.”\nVoice 2 \nThe fourth tip to living a healthy life in old age is to give to your community. A person can give money. But adding to your community is so much more than money. Throughout life, a person learns a lot of different skills. Some skills are learned at work. But some skills are learned through hobbies or other life experiences. A person can use the skills he has learned to improve the community around him. A person can discover meaning and purpose to life when they find a way to add to their community. It is also a good way to help those people that they care about.\nA grandmother teaches her grandchild how to knit; Photo by Alex Green from Pexels\nVoice 1 \nThe last tip for living a healthy life as we age is to keep learning. Erika Andersen is a writer for Forbes. She says in many places of the world people are living longer. But they are not always living better. She thinks one solution is to stay connected to the world through learning. This could be reading about something you do not know much about. It could be trying a new food – or even meeting a new person. Andersen writes:\nVoice 5 \n“One of the best ways to stay active as you get older is to always choose to learn new things. The least interesting older people I know are those who find a comfortable place and stop. They do the same things. They have the same conversations. They express the same opinions. Choose to learn something totally new every week or every month. There is nothing like being bad at something to wake you up and shake you out of your understanding. And when you start to get good at it, it can make you feel as excited as a six-year-old.”\nVoice 2 \nWhat about you? How will you stay healthy as you grow older?

                "content": "Voice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Colin Lowther.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nHave you ever seen a person try to stand up and then make this sound? Did it make you think they were old? Did it make you wonder what happened to them? As we grow, our bodies become less able to move. We must slow down when we move or exercise or play sport. We must be careful. If we are not careful, we can hurt our neck, our knees, or our back. When this happens, it can take weeks or even months to feel better. And even simple things, like sitting down, become a problem. This does not only happen to much older people. It starts happening as we enter adulthood.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThis program is part of a series of programs called Tips for a Healthy Life. Other programs focused on pregnancy, the first year of life, childhood, and the teenage years. Today’s Spotlight is on how to live a healthy adult life and recover from injury.\nVoice 1 \nBefore we begin, we should note that all information in this program is not meant to replace going to a doctor. If you have a serious injury or sickness, you should go to a doctor for help.\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe human body is an amazing thing. It can fix itself. This is a miracle that most people do not think about. Julie K. Silver is a doctor who specializes in helping people recover after serious sickness or injury. She is amazed at how the human body works to repair itself after an injury. She wrote for AARP.com:\nVoice 3 \n“Your body works hard to help you recover. Even if you do little to help the process along. There is a lot happening in your body, both day and night, to help you to heal. When you are injured, white blood cells go to the injury to stop things getting worse. Other blood cells remove dead cells and help to control inflammation. If you break a bone, bone cells build the rough edges back together. There are so many cells assisting us in healing that we could never count them all. These processes happen on their own. But there are things smart patients can do to speed and strengthen their recovery.”\nVoice 1 \nSo what are these things that can help people heal faster and better? The first and best thing you can do is to sleep more. Everyone knows that a good night of sleep makes you feel great. But scientists in many different fields of study believe sleep helps in growth, recovery, and mental health. Most healthy people are not getting enough sleep. And Dr. Silver says that people recovering from an injury need even more. She says,\nVoice 3 \n“If you are like most people, you need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. During sickness you may need more rest than that. Your body’s healing processes require sleep to work. For example, your body produces the chemical melatonin when you sleep. This chemical increases your immune system and helps repair your body. It may even help prevent some forms of cancer. But if you are not sleeping enough at night, your melatonin levels can be reduced.”\n\nClick here to see the Advanced version of this program\nVoice 2 \nThe next tip for recovering after injury is to continue to move in healthy ways. Do not make the injury worse. Many athletes continue to exercise and play sport when they are injured. They do not know the difference between pain from effort and pain from injury. In these cases, they may need total rest. But many experts say that light activity can help people heal faster. In fact, a study from 2005 showed that wounds healed faster when people moved.\nImage by Louis Moore from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nResearchers from Ohio State University in Columbus studied a group of older adults from ages 55 to 77. All the adults were healthy. During the study, about half of the adults exercised three times a week for three months. The other half did not exercise during this time. Each person in the study also received a small but deep wound on the upper part of their arm. Researchers took pictures of the wound over time as it healed. And the adults recorded their exercise. At the end of the study, researchers discovered something amazing. The wounds of the people who exercised healed about ten days faster than the wounds of the people who did not exercise.\nVoice 2 \nThe next tip to recover after an injury is to eat good food and drink enough water. Food is the first medicine. What we put in our bodies becomes our bodies. Foods like fish, eggs, and yogurt can help with broken bones. Meat, nuts, and seeds can help our blood. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C. Vitamin C helps people stay healthy and heal from cuts on the skin. Eating good food is important for all people. And it is very important when recovering from a sickness or injury.\nImage by Anant Sharma from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe final tip to help recover after an injury is to work on the mental parts of recovery. An injury often requires us to change the way we live. This can be frustrating. We want to be able to live at the same fast speed that we always did. But an injury can make us slow down. Carrie Cheadle is a professor of sports psychology at John F. Kennedy University. She told Outside Magazine how people cannot deny what it will take to recover. She says:\nVoice 4 \n“You should not ignore the frustration and sadness that come with injury. But you should look at all the good things in your life. Let yourself have some joy. It makes you understand that everything is not horrible. It is often as simple as focusing on something that makes you happy that is not exercise or sport. You may even try keeping a journal and writing down three things you are thankful for every night. This can help move your thoughts away from your injury.”\nVoice 2 \nHave you ever had an injury?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3 \nHere is tonight’s top story: something is happening to young people around the world. We have reports of young people acting strangely. Young people are changing very quickly. They sleep all the time. They eat large amounts of food. They smell very bad. They are only able to communicate with their friends and not with their parents. If you see a young person, use extreme care. They may become angry for no reason. What is causing these changes? Is there any hope for these young people?\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nYou may wish you had heard a news story like this before you knew a teenager. You may be happy to learn that there are answers for some of these questions! Today’s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life during the teenage years.\nVoice 2 \nYoung people go through a lot of changes. These changes are called puberty. Puberty is the process of a body changing from a child into an adult. It can begin as early as age nine in girls. It usually begins later in boys. In boys, puberty usually begins around age 12.\nVoice 1 \nThe bodies of young people change a lot. Their bodies can grow many centimeters in just a few years. Young people grow taller and more muscular. Girls develop breasts and their bodies become able to have babies. Boys’ voices become lower and their bodies become ready to make a baby with a woman.\nImage by Pexels from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nYoung people also experience a lot of changes outside their bodies. Their relationships change. Young people depend less on their parents. They may become busy with school. Michelle Zehr is a writer for the website Livestrong.com. She wrote about the pressure on young people.\nVoice 4 \n“Your teenage years come with a lot of pressures. These include the pressures to fit in and do well in school. There is school, sports, special interests and even a part-time job. It can be difficult to find the time to lead a healthy life. But as a young person it is important to remember that the healthy things you do now will help you through the rest of your life.”\nVoice 1 \nYoung people can do several things to have a healthy life. The first thing a young person can do is to get enough sleep. Experts say that young people need between nine and nine and a half hours of sleep every night. This is because young people are growing and changing so fast. And sleep can help with these changes.\nVoice 2 \nThe second thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to wash and care for skin and body. Charles Wibbelsman is a doctor for children and a writer. He wrote for the website WebMD.\nVoice 5 \n“Parents too often think that children will somehow just learn what they need to know about cleaning their body. But that is not true. Someone has to teach them.”\nVoice 1 \nSomeone needs to teach children about washing their body, skin, and hair. This includes changing clothes regularly, cleaning teeth, and know when their feet smell bad. Young people will not find these things difficult. But they must remember this new responsibility.\nVoice 2 \nThe third thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to eat and drink good foods. During these years, young people eat a lot of food. But they do not always eat good, healthy food. Sometimes young people eat too much food that is fast and easy to eat, such as sweets, pizza, or boxed foods. They do not eat enough fresh food like fruits and vegetables.\nVoice 1 \nThe fourth thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to avoid risky behaviour. Parents give advice to young people. But young people like to test limits. They may smoke or try drugs and alcohol. They may chew betel-nut or tobacco. These things can become addictive. Once a person begins using them, it can be difficult to stop. They are harmful to the body.\nImage by karosieben from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nYoung people feel a lot of pressure to do these things. Young people want to be like their friends. If their friends drink alcohol, they will want to drink alcohol too. Young people may feel less worried about what other people think of them if they use drugs or alcohol. Drugs and alcohol can make a person feel good for a short time. But these things can hurt your body in ways that will only appear years later.\nVoice 1 \nThe other common risky behaviour is sex. Young people start to be interested in sex. Sex is an important part of life. But it does have different risks when people are not married. Zehr writes,\nVoice 4 \n“If you have decided to have sex as a teenager, be smart about your health. To avoid pregnancy and getting a sexually transmitted disease, use protection in the form of condoms, birth control pills, or other methods. Remember that not all birth control methods protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Talk to your doctor about the birth control methods that are right for you. When you become sexually active, make a yearly trip to your doctor.”\nImage by Hong Manh from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nThe final thing is for parents. Parents need to love and support their children through these changes. Parents experience changes too. They need to begin giving their children more responsibility and choice. Parents can tell their children that these changes are a normal part of life. The website Better Health channel is made by the government of the Australian state of Victoria. It advises parents:\nVoice 6 \n“You may need to accept that you will not have total control over your child’s choices and life direction. It may help to trust that you have done your best as a parent. But if your child makes new friendships that lead to acts that concern you, such as violence or drug taking, you may feel stress. In these times it may be useful to seek help from a family counsellor or other service which offers parenting help or classes. Let your child know you are there for them, no matter how old they are.”\nVoice 1 \nWhat do you think makes the teenage years better? What is the best advice you can give a teenager?

But there are ways to help you raise a healthy and happy child. These three things are taking care of the physical body, caring for the mind, and having healthy relationships with other people.\nVoice 1 \nThe first way to have a healthy childhood is to take care of the physical body. If a child lives in a dangerous situation, they cannot have a healthy life. Parents cannot stop all hurt and harm. Children often get hurt playing hard or falling down. This is one of the ways children learn about what is safe and what is not. But parents should work to keep children as safe as possible. Parents need to be careful around water, especially with young children. Other concerns are fire, guns, and knives. Children like to explore. But they should not explore things that could lead to injury or death.\nVoice 2 \nParents should also take children for regular medical tests. Doctors examine if children are growing. Doctors also give vaccines. Vaccines are medicines given to children before they get sick. They are tested and safe. Sometimes vaccines can seem frightening. However, according to the United States Center for Disease Control website:\nVoice 3 \n“Vaccines during childhood are very important. That is because they help protect children before they are exposed to life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to make sure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the right ages.”\nPhoto by James Gathany, Judy Schmidt, USCDCP on Pixnio\nVoice 1 \nThe last part of caring for a child’s physical body is making sure the child is eating good food and getting enough exercise. A report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, says:\nVoice 4 \n“Children ages three through five should be encouraged to move and be active. They should do things such as throwing games and bicycle or tricycle riding. To strengthen bones, young children should hop, skip, jump, and roll around. A target may be three hours each day. This can be all kinds of exercises: light, moderate, or fast. Children ages six through 17 years can achieve most health benefits by doing moderate and fast physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes or more each day.”\nVoice 2 \nRemember that most children learn by watching what adults do. If adults are eating good food and exercising, children will also want to do these things. And if adults around them smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol, children may do that. If adults spend hours looking at a phone, then children will want to do that too. Parents need to teach with their words. But they also need to show children with their actions.\nVoice 1 \nPhysical bodies are important. But adults must also take care of children’s minds. Children are learning all the time. And they start learning even before they are in school. Even babies learn to see faces, shapes, and different colors. Young children learn about what things feel like, what different foods taste like, and how to move and walk.\nImage by Joshua Tee from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nWhen children are old enough, they should attend school. It is not enough that some children get an education. A good education is important for all boys and girls. And education is important for the future of the whole world. Jessie Woolley-Wilson is the CEO of Dreambox. Dreambox is an online mathematics teaching program. She wrote for Fast Company magazine.\nVoice 5 \n“Our shared future depends on every child receiving a quality education. They will need to be ready to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. It does not matter their sex, race, or where they live.”\nVoice 1 \nThe third thing people can do to create a healthy childhood is to take care of a child’s heart. That is, children need good relationships with other people. It is also important that a child feels emotionally connected to a community of people. Jason Williams is the Director of Quality and Safety at the Children’s Hospital Colorado. He wrote about connecting with children on the hospital’s website:\nVoice 6 \n“Anything can connect with children. You can go on a bike ride, walk the dog, talk in the car, or let them help you shop. Any time you spend around your children can be a chance for connection. It does not have to be complex. With a baby, it could be as simple as 30 seconds of play or touching her toes. With older kids, it can just be taking time to stop and look at something your child is interested in. You can comment on it and see the world through her eyes. It could be playing a game — even a video game. Or it could be having a teenager show you what he is posting on Instagram. The important thing is to get on their level, be in their world.”\nImage by Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke from Pixabay \nVoice 2 \nLife is not easy for parents or children. Some parents cannot create a healthy space for their children, even if they want to. They do not have enough money or experience. They may not be able to get good medical care. They may not be able to send their child to the best school. Yet all parents can offer love and connection to their children. And love and connection are two of the most important things people can give to children.\nVoice 1 \nWhat else do you think helps a child live a healthy life?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nOne morning Mary felt strange. She did not feel sick, but she did feel different. She and her husband had been trying to have a baby. Mary wondered if she could be pregnant. So, she took a pregnancy test. She was pregnant! Mary and her husband were going to have a baby. They were filled with excitement and joy. But soon, they felt something else — worry. Mary worried that she did not know what she should do to have a healthy pregnancy. A healthy pregnancy would help her baby to be healthy.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 2 \nThis is a made-up story. But these are common worries for many pregnant women and their partners. Pregnancy can have risks. But there are also things people can do to have a healthy pregnancy. These things cannot make sure the baby is healthy. But they can give the baby and mother a better chance at health. Today’s Spotlight is on simple tips for a healthy pregnancy.\nVoice 1 \nThere is a lot of advice for pregnant women. Some of this advice is cultural. Different cultures offer different advice for pregnant women. Or it seems like there is too much advice. A pregnant woman may feel like it is all too much to do! But these tips are general. They are simple ways that pregnant women can be a little healthier.\nVoice 2 \nThe first tip for pregnant mothers is to eat good foods. A baby still living inside a mother’s body is called a fetus. The fetus gets all it needs from what a mother eats. For a baby to be healthy, it needs healthy foods as a fetus. Pregnant women should eat vegetables and fruits. They should eat whole grains like oats and rice. Protein is also important. It is found in foods like eggs, beans, nuts, and meats. It is also good to eat some cheese or yogurt.\nImage by Andrey Cojocaru from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nHowever, there are some foods pregnant women should avoid. Many health experts say that pregnant women should not eat unwashed foods, soft cheeses, or meat that is not cooked. These foods can contain harmful bacteria. This bacteria can cause the woman to lose important nutrients in her body. It can even cause the woman’s body to reject the fetus. Some experts also say that pregnant women should limit their caffeine. This is the drug found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks. Too much caffeine can result in the baby having unhealthy low birth-weight.\nVoice 2 \nBut the two things that women should ALWAYS avoid during pregnancy are smoking and alcohol. Smoking can result in early birth before the baby is ready. It can also cause the fetus not to grow properly. And pregnant women should avoid all alcohol. The Center for Disease Control in the United States writes on their website about alcohol and pregnancy. They say:\nVoice 3 \n“There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time during pregnancy to drink. All kinds of alcohol are equally harmful. This includes wine and beer. Alcohol in the mother’s blood goes into the baby. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, death, and several physical, behavioral, and mental problems.”\nVoice 1 \nOne thing a woman should drink while pregnant is clean water. Water is a good drink for all people. Water improves blood flow, skin health, and digestion. If a woman does not drink enough water during pregnancy, she may not produce enough breast milk. She may get a headache or feel more tired.\nVoice 2 \nAnother tip for a healthy pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin. These vitamins are designed to help pregnant women. Sometimes it is difficult for a woman to get all she needs through food. But a good prenatal vitamin will include iron for the blood, calcium for bones, folic acid for the health of the baby, and many other things.\nImage by Ri Butov from Pixabay\nVoice 1 \nThe next tip for a healthy pregnancy is to sleep a lot. It can be difficult to sleep during pregnancy. As the fetus grows inside the mother, it pushes her internal organs around. Woman can suffer from back pain and difficulty breathing. But sleep can help everyone. When people sleep enough, they reduce stress, build muscle, repair body tissues, and process things they have learned that day.\nVoice 2 \nA pregnant woman may have to try new things to be able to sleep. The best position for her to sleep in is on her side. Sleeping on her back or stomach can cause problems. A woman can use pillows or other soft things to get into a comfortable position. If possible, a woman’s partner should encourage her to sleep longer. He could take on a few more morning duties for her. Or he could encourage her to sleep during the day.\nVoice 1 \nBut even if a pregnant woman is sleeping more, she still needs to stay active and exercise if she can! This is the sixth tip for a healthy pregnancy. Exercise is good for most people. This is true for pregnant woman as well. It is important that women talk to their doctor before beginning any exercise program. Staying physically strong during the pregnancy can also help with the birth and recovery.\nVoice 2 \nThe final tip for a healthy pregnancy is to think about a plan for the birth of the baby. Labor is usually painful and can be frightening. Thinking about what the birth might be like can give a woman some control over what is happening. She can make a plan for how she would like things to go or about who she would like to be there.\nVoice 1 \nPeople cannot always control if there is a healthy birth or not. But there are things that women can do to have the most healthy pregnancy possible. And there are things their partners can do to encourage them in this work. A healthy pregnancy sets up a healthy baby. And a healthy baby can mean a healthy life.\nImage by Brian Odwar from Pixabay\nVoice 2 \nWill you have to change anything if you become pregnant?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nIn today’s Spotlight we tell the second part of the Easter story. In an earlier program we told how a large crowd of people cheered joyfully for Jesus as he entered the city of Jerusalem. They were excited because they had heard about Jesus’ great teaching and miracles. Then Jesus ate a special meal with his followers, called disciples. But one of his disciples betrayed him. The disciple told the religious leaders where they could find Jesus. The religious leaders did not like Jesus’ teachings or his popularity. So they brought him to the governor – the area’s Roman leader. The people demanded that the governor sentence Jesus to death. So, he did. This is where part two of our story begins.\nNarrator \nAfter the governor sentenced Jesus to death, Roman soldiers took him away. They laughed at him. Jesus claimed he was the king of the Jews. Now the soldiers made a crown out of a plant with sharp thorns. They pushed the crown on Jesus’ head and laughed at him.\nSoldier 1 \n“Ha! Yes, now you look like a king. Let’s worship our new king!”\nSoldier 2 \n“Yes, we honor you, king of the Jews!”\nNarrator \nThe soldiers spat on him and beat him. Then they made him carry a large cross. It was made of two pieces of wood. And it was extremely heavy. Crowds of people gathered in the streets to watch Jesus carry the cross.\nFinally, Jesus and the soldiers arrived at a place called Golgotha. This is where the government often executed criminals. The Roman soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross. They put small, sharp pieces of metal through his hands and feet. The nails held Jesus in place as soldiers lifted the cross to stand. Jesus’ enemies stood under the cross. They laughed at Jesus and mocked him.\nSoldier 1 \n“So, are you really a king?”\nSoldier 2 \n“Save yourself, then! If you are really the son of God, come down from that cross and save yourself!”\nSoldier 1 \n“Yes, come down! Then we will believe in you!”\nNarrator \nBut Jesus knew that in order to save God’s people, he had to die. He was a perfect man. He had never sinned. But he was not just a man. He was also God. Jesus knew he must suffer to pay for the sins of all humans. If he did, all people would be free from the punishment they deserved – death. He looked at the people below him, laughing at him. He cried out:\nJesus \n“Father God! Forgive them! They do not know what they are doing!”\nNarrator \nFor hours Jesus hung on the cross. He experienced great torture. But finally, he knew that it was his time to die. He cried out again:\nJesus \n“Father, I give my spirit into your hands.”\nNarrator \nAfter he said this, he died. At this moment miracles happened through the city. There was an earthquake. Rocks split. An important curtain in the temple split. Jesus was dead.\nIt was almost night time. Jesus’ followers wanted to prepare his body to be buried. A few men and women asked the governor for Jesus’ body. He gave it to them. They covered Jesus’ body in clean cloths. Then they put his body into a stone burial tomb. They rolled a large stone in front of the tomb – to close it. Jesus was buried.\nA few days later, two women visited Jesus’ tomb. They were Jesus’ followers, Mary and Mary Magdalene. They had come to mourn. As they walked, they wondered how they would enter the tomb.\nMary Magdalene           \n“Who will roll away the stone for us? It is much too big for us to move ourselves.”\nMary    \n“Yes, if we cannot move the stone, we cannot see Jesus’ body.”\nNarrator \nBut when they arrived, they felt the earth shake. They saw that the stone in front of the tomb was gone! They went into the tomb. They looked around. They saw a man, but it was not Jesus. This man looked like he was dressed in light. The women were so afraid that they could not speak. But the man said:\nAngel   \n“Do not be afraid. I know you are looking for Jesus who died on the cross. He is not here. He is alive – he has risen from the dead! Come look for yourselves.”\nNarrator \nThe women were afraid, but also filled with joy! The man continued:\nAngel   \n“Go! Go quickly and tell his disciples that Jesus is alive! You will see him soon.”\nNarrator \nThe women immediately left to find the disciples. They ran to where some of the disciples were.\nDisciple 1 \n“What are you doing Mary? Why are you running?”\nDisciple 2 \n“You look frightened!”\nMary    \n“He… He is alive!”\nDisciple 1\n“What? Who? Who are you talking about?\nMary Magdalene\n“Jesus! His tomb is empty. He is gone! Alive! A man was there – a man like I have never seen. He told us that Jesus is alive!”\nDisciple 2 \n“This cannot be true!”\nNarrator \nSome of the disciples ran to see the empty tomb with their own eyes. They found it empty – just as the women had said.\nOver the next weeks Jesus met with all of his disciples. The disciples could not believe what they were seeing. They had seen Jesus die. They had buried him. But he was here now. They felt Jesus’ hands and feet. They felt where the metal nails had gone through his skin into the cross. They ate meals with him. He was alive. Jesus explained everything to them. He said:\nJesus \n“I have done everything that I came to do. Prophets from long ago said that Christ would suffer and then rise again on the third day. And because of this all people on earth can be forgiven of their sins. You are witnesses to everything that I have done.” [Luke 24:46]Narrator After about a month, Jesus returned to heaven. But before he left, he told his disciples to tell everyone about what had happened. He said:Jesus “All authority in heaven and on earth is mine. So go to the people of all nations. Make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Teach them everything I have told you. I will be with you always until the end of time.” [Matthew 28:18]Voice 1 Since this time, this is what the followers of Jesus do. They spread the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection – the story of how he came to life after death. During Easter, Christians remember this great miracle. Christ Jesus died and rose to life again. He forgave people from their sins. Hallelujah! Praise and thanks to God!The writer of this program was Liz Waid. The producer was Mark Drenth. This telling of the Easter Story is based on the book of Matthew, in the Christian Bible. You can listen to this program again on the internet at www.radioenglish.net.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nA crowd of people welcomes a man into their city. They cheer and praise him as he enters the city gates. But soon, this same crowd will call for this man’s death. He will die. But his death is not the end of the story. In fact, it will begin a new story – the story of a miracle for all people. Christians around the world celebrate this event at Easter. Every spring, Christians remember and retell this story. Today, Spotlight tells the Easter story.\nNarrator \nThe story begins about 2000 years ago in the city of Jerusalem, in the ancient Roman province of Palestine. It is the Jewish holiday of Passover. During this holiday, the people remember how God led them out of slavery hundreds of years before. Many Jewish people gather in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover miracle. On this day, a man named Jesus and his followers were preparing to enter the city to celebrate Passover.\nJesus was a great prophet and teacher. He performed many miracles and taught people how to live good lives. Jesus said he was sent from God. He had come to save all people from the effects of their sins.\nMany people loved Jesus. But many religious leaders did not. The things Jesus said and did made the leaders angry. They believed that only God could do the things Jesus spoke about.\nWhen Jesus arrived in Jerusalem, he was riding on a simple donkey. But the people welcomed him like a king. They spread their coats on the ground in front of Jesus’ donkey. They took palm tree leaves and laid them in the donkey’s path. They cheered and shouted:\n“Blessed is the son of David!”\n“Hosanna! Praise!”\n“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”\n“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”\nNarrator \nJesus continued riding until he reached the great temple. During Passover, people are supposed to offer sacrifices to God. But inside the temple, people were not praying and sacrificing. They were buying and selling things. They had made it a marketplace. Jesus became angry. And he turned over some of the tables. He told the people the temple was for worshipping God – not making money. After this, the religious leaders decided they needed to silence Jesus. He was making trouble for them.\nOver the next few days, Jesus continued teaching about God and performing miracles. But someone was about to betray Jesus. It was one of his own followers, or disciples. The disciple’s name was Judas. One night Judas went to the religious leaders. As he came near, they said:\nPriest  \n“We know you! You are Judas. You are a follower of Jesus. Troublemaker… What are you doing here?”\nJudas \n“I have a deal for you. What will you give me if I give Jesus to you?”\nPriest  \n“You cannot be serious. Are you telling us the truth? Can it be that easy?”\nJudas \n“Yes. What will you give me if I do it?”\nNarrator \nThe religious leaders agreed to pay Judas 30 silver coins to betray Jesus.\nOn the first night of the Passover feast, Jesus and the disciples gathered to eat a meal together. As they were eating, Jesus told them that one of them would betray him. The disciples all became very sad. They asked who it would be. But Jesus did not tell them. Then Jesus took some bread from the table. He thanked God for it. Then he broke the bread into pieces. He gave the pieces of bread to his disciples. He said:\nJesus   \n“Take this, and eat it. This is a symbol of my body.”\nNarrator \nThen Jesus took a cup of wine from the table. Again, he thanked God for it. Then he passed the cup to each of his disciples and said:\nJesus \n“All of you drink from this cup. This is a symbol of my blood. It is a symbol of the promise between God and humans. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people. After I die, you should do these things to remember me.”\nNarrator \nThe disciples did all that Jesus told them to do. They did not know what Jesus was talking about. But they sang a song of praise to God. Then they went out of the house.\nAfter the meal, Jesus and his followers travelled to a place called Gethsemane. Here, Jesus prayed to God. Jesus knew Judas would betray him. He knew he would die and that it would be a painful death. Jesus did not want to experience a painful death. But he knew that his death would save people. Jesus had lived a perfect life. He had never sinned. But he chose to die to save people from results of their sin. For an hour, Jesus prayed to God. He pleaded with God:\nJesus \n“My Father, God, if it is possible, take this suffering away from me. But let what you want be done, not what I want.”\nNarrator \nAfter praying, Jesus returned to his disciples. But he found them sleeping! He seemed angry with them and asked them to keep watch again. Again, Jesus left the group to pray alone. After praying, he returned again to his disciples. And again he found them sleeping! He went back to pray a third time. But when he returned the third time, he called to the disciples:\nJesus \n“Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The time is near. Get up, let’s go! Here comes the man who will betray me.”\nNarrator \nJudas arrived with a large crowd carrying weapons. The crowd did not know which man was Jesus. So Judas told them he would kiss Jesus to identify him. Judas saw Jesus. He went to Jesus and said:\nJudas \n“Greetings Jesus.”\nNarrator \nHe gave Jesus a kiss. Jesus answered him:\nJesus \n“Friend, do what you came to do.”\nNarrator \nThree soldiers from the crowd arrested Jesus. He went with them peacefully. His disciples ran away.\nSoon after his arrest Jesus stood before the governor. This Roman leader would decide Jesus’ punishment. The religious leaders told the governor that Jesus was causing trouble. They told him that Jesus thought he was the king!\nThe governor did not know what to do. He knew Jesus was innocent. But it seemed like the people wanted Jesus dead. He stood in front of the crowd of people. He asked them:\nPilate   \n“What do you want me to do with this innocent man? What do you want me to do to Jesus?”\nCrowd \n“Crucify him!”\nPilate   \n“But what has he done?”\nCrowd \n“Crucify him! Crucify him!”\nNarrator \nSo the governor gave the crowd what they wanted. He sentenced Jesus to death – death on a cross.\nVoice 1 \nThis is not the end of the story. Jesus would face death. But what makes this story so important to Christians?

                "content": "Voice 1\nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Roger Basick.\nVoice 2\nAnd I’m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nEvery year, on March 17th, the city of Chicago in the United States, does something unusual. They change the colour of the river that runs through the city. They use food colouring to turn the water green! They use about 18 kilograms of this vegetable-based dye for the water. They do this to celebrate an Irish saint – Saint Patrick.\nVoice 2\nMany Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations involve a lot of food and drinks. Some of the food and drinks are green too. Another tradition is to wear green. And if you do not, someone may just pinch you. They may pull a little bit of skin between two fingers. But Chicago is only one place that celebrates Saint Patrick – people in cities and countries around the world celebrate him.\nVoice 1\nBut who is Saint Patrick? And why do people celebrate him on March 17th every year? Today’s Spotlight is on Saint Patrick and his holiday.\nVoice 2\nSaint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland. He is known for his religious work on that island. Historical church documents tell us some things about his life. But he also recorded his life and passion for his Christian faith in his letters.\nVoice 1\nSaint Patrick was bornin Britain around the year 386. At this time, the Roman Empire in Britain was ending. Violent groups from Ireland invaded the land. They stole land, money, animals, objects and even people. When Patrick was 16, people from Ireland raided his family’s home. They took Patrick and held him as a slave. He was kept in Ireland for six years. There, he worked as a shepherd and spent most of his time out in the fields caring for sheep Patrick wrote in his letters that he depended on God when he felt lonely or afraid.\nVoice 2\nAfter being held for six years, Patrick escaped. In his letters, he writes that he had a strange dream. In the dream, he heard the voice of God telling him to leave. So Patrick left. He walked almost 322 kilometres toward the Irish coast. There, he was able to get on a ship to Britain and return to his family.\nVoice 1\nIn Britain, Patrick studied to become a Christian priest. He lived with other religious men, as a monk. But then, Patrick’s writings say that he had another dream, this time from an angel. This angel told Patrick to go back to Ireland.\nVoice 2\nHistorical records show that Patrick did return to Ireland. There, Patrick shared Christianity with the people. Because Patrick had lived in Ireland for many years, he knew the language and the people. He combined old Irish customs and traditions with the new message about the Christian faith. He did this to help the native people keep their own culture. For example, Patrick invented traditions to honor the Easter holiday. Easter is one of the most important Christian holidays. But the Irish did not celebrate Easter. The Irish worshiped other gods. And they worshiped their gods with fire. Saint Patrick used fire in his Easter celebrations. He used these ideas to explain the new religion. This also honoured the local culture.\nVoice 1\nHe also added a circle to the common Christian cross. This became the Celtic cross or the cross of Ireland. The circle was the symbol of the sun. The sun was a powerful Irish symbol for many people. Patrick combined the circle and cross. This showed that Jesus was like the sun.\nVoice 2\nSt. Patrick is also closely connected to the green shamrock plant. It has three leaves. It is often used as a symbol of Ireland. Some stories suggest that St. Patrick used this plant to teach people the Christian idea of the Trinity – that God is three but also one.\nVoice 1\nBut just how did the world start celebrating St. Patrick’s day on March 17th every year? That is because March 17th is the anniversary of St. Patrick’s death. He died on that day in the year 461. The Irish have celebrated this day for over a thousand years. Traditionally, people attended a religious service early in the day. Then they returned home to eat, drink and dance.\nVoice 2\nAs Irish people moved to other countries, the traditions went with them. The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was in New York City, in the United States, in the year 1762. Irish soldiers were serving in the English military there. They marched through the streets. This parade helped the soldiers feel a sense of their national culture. They celebrated the parade with Irish symbols, music and food. One of the most popular instruments used in these parades were bagpipes.\nVoice 1\nIn the 17-and 1800’s, large groups of Irish immigrants moved to the United States. This spread Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations to many communities there. But the United States and Ireland are not the only placed that celebrate this holiday. People in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Japan and Russia all celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. People have even celebrated this day on the International Space Station!\nVoice 2\nBut the biggest celebrations today are in Ireland. It has been a public holiday there since 1903. Today, in the city of Dublin, about one million people take part in Saint Patrick’s Festival. This celebration is five days long! It includes parades, music, dancing, outdoor plays, fireworks and more!\nVoice 1\nIn the past, Saint Patrick’s Day was mainly a religious celebration. Until the 1970’s, Irish law even said that the bars must be closed on March 17th. But now in most places, it is more a celebration of Ireland and Irish culture. But no matter why you celebrate, make sure to wear green on March 17th – or you may get pinched!\nVoice 2\nDo people celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day where you live? Do you?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nChristmas is one of the few holidays celebrated all around the world. But every country has its own ways of celebrating Christmas. These celebrations pass from one generation to another to create special traditions. In this way, people of every age can enjoy the excitement and stories of Christmas.\nVoice 2 \nAll the different celebrations, traditions, and Christmas stories are also similar. This is because they are all based on one story. It is the story of the first Christmas — the day Jesus Christ was born. The word “Christ” was not part of his name. The word Christ is a special name for someone who would rescue people. It was a special name for a new kind of King.\nVoice 1 \nJesus was born in the ancient city of Bethlehem, in the Middle East. After he was born, a star appeared in the sky. At that time, there was a tradition about new stars. A new star appearing meant that a new king was born. A small group of important men lived very far away from Bethlehem. Today, many people call these men the Magi or the Wise Men. The Wise Men saw this star. They wanted to bring gifts to this new baby king. So they travelled to find the baby. They had to travel far. But a star is not a map. It does not give a perfect location. The Wise Men had to stop and ask if anyone had heard of a king being born.\nVoice 2 \nThis story is the starting point for our program today. It is a legend. It probably did not happen exactly as it is told. But it is a story that tells us something about the world or the way we should live. Today’s Spotlight is on the Russian Christmas legend of Babushka.\nVoice 1 \nThis Christmas story begins in the land that is now Southern Russia. It happened a long time ago on the night when Jesus was born. It was winter. Snow covered the earth. Ice covered the tree branches. And the cold wind blew. An old woman called Babushka was alone in her home. But she was happy that she had a fire to keep her warm. She did not have to go out into the cold.\nVoice 2 \nSuddenly, there was a noise at her door. Someone was knocking! When she opened the door, three old Wise Men were standing there. They were wearing the clothes of kings. They carried gifts and packages. They said to her,\nVoice 3 \n“Babushka, we have travelled from a far away country. We have stopped to tell you of the Christ-child who was born tonight in Bethlehem. He comes to rule the world. And he will teach all men and women to be loving and true. We are bringing him gifts.”\nVoice 1 \nBabushka invited the men to stay and get warm. She gave them hot food to eat. They told her about the star they were following. Babushka wished that she could see this little baby King. The men invited Babushka to come with them.\nVoice 3 \n“Come with us, Babushka! Then you can bring a gift of your own!”\nVoice 2 \nBut Babushka looked out the window at the cold night. She thought of going out into the cold. She decided that she did not want to leave her warm room. So the three men continued on alone in the cold winter night.\nVoice 1 \nBut that night Babushka could not sleep. She kept thinking about what the old men told her. She kept thinking about the wonderful chance they offered – to see the baby Jesus. Finally, she decided that in the morning she would go to see the Christ-child. And she hoped that on her way, she would see the old men.\nVoice 2 \nIn the morning, Babushka filled a container with gold balls, wood toys, and other play things for children. Then she put on her coat and went to see the baby Jesus. But Babushka remembered something. She had not asked the three Wise Men the way to Bethlehem. And now they had travelled so far during the night that she could not find them.\nVoice 1 \nBabushka decided to continue on. She hurried up and down many roads. And she asked every person she met,\nVoice 4 \n“I want to see the Christ-child. Where is he? I am bringing him beautiful toys.”\nVoice 1 \nBut no one could tell her the way. Each person told her,\nVoice 5 \n“Continue on Babushka, keep going.”\nVoice 2 \nSo Babushka kept travelling. She travelled for years and years. But she never found the child. In Russia, they say she is still travelling and looking for the baby Jesus. And every year, on the night before Christmas, she comes into the towns carrying her bag of toys. She enters each house when the children are sleeping. She holds a light close to the little children’s faces. She says,\nVoice 4 \n“Is he here? Is the baby Jesus here?”\nVoice 1 \nThen she shakes her head sadly. But she leaves a toy from her bag next to each sleeping child. Then Babushka continues on her way.\nVoice 2 \nPeople tell the story of Babushka every year at Christmas time. Often, these Christmas legends explain how a particular tradition began. The story of Babushka explains how presents appear while children sleep. Many cultures or countries have different legends that explain the mystery of surprise gifts. There is a story from Italy that is similar to Bubushka. It is called La Befana. Some parts are the same, but other parts are different.\nVoice 1 \nAnother story that explains the tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is the story of Saint Nicholas. This story has changed a lot from the story in the Bible. The most well- known version has become Santa Claus. But the Santa Claus story that is in films today has snow, elf helpers, and flying reindeer. This is a very different from the story of the Wise Men bringing gifts to a baby Jesus.\nVoice 2 \nStories like Babushka may not be true. But these stories are important. They help us explain traditions. They help us understand the world and make meaning of our lives.\nVoice 1 \nHave you heard this story of Babushka before?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nChristmas. It is the most celebrated holiday in the world. Around the world, over two billion people celebrate this holiday every year. Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ – an event that happened over 2,000 years ago.\nMost people in the world celebrate Christmas on December 25th. However, some Christians from countries like Russia, Egypt and Ethiopia celebrate Christmas on January 7th. Traditionally, the Christmas season lasts for 12 days. However, in many places, people celebrate only Christmas day and the day before, called Christmas Eve.\nAround the world, people follow many different Christmas traditions. But no matter how or when people celebrate Christmas, everyone celebrates with food! Today’s Spotlight is on Christmas foods from around the world.\nFood is an important part of most holiday celebrations. Large meals, or feasts, bring people together. And often, holiday foods represent what the holiday is about. Join Spotlight as we tell about these Christmas foods.\nVoice 2 \nIn the United Kingdom, people eat a large Christmas meal. When they are done, they eat a sweet dessert called Christmas pudding. Christmas pudding contains ingredients like dried fruit, alcohol, butter, sugar, eggs, flour and spices. Many people make Christmas pudding with 13 ingredients. This number has a religious meaning. It represents Jesus Christ and his 12 closest followers, called the disciples.\nTraditionally, people begin making Christmas pudding five weeks before Christmas! They begin by combining and steaming the pudding ingredients. Some people only mix the ingredients in one direction – from east to west. They do this to remember part of the Christmas story. The Christian Bible says that a group of wise men came from the east to see the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.\nAfter cooking the Christmas pudding, people let it set for a few weeks. On Christmas day, they cook it again. Often, they pour an alcohol called brandy over it and set it on fire. It is a beautiful thing to see.\nMillions of people in the United Kingdom eat Christmas pudding at Christmas. However, today, many people choose to buy it instead of make it.\nVoice 3 \nIn northern Europe, many people celebrate Christmas with another kind of pudding. In Iceland, it is called Mödnlugrautur. And in Sweden, it is called Julgröt. This sweet pudding is made from rice, sugar, salt, milk and spices like cinnamon. In Denmark, people call it Risalamande and they serve it with a sweet fruit sauce on top.\nThis pudding is part of a Christmas game. The person that makes the pudding hides a whole almond nut in it. They serve the pudding to everyone at the end of the meal. Each person eats their pudding and hopes to find the almond in their bowl. Finding the almond means you will have good luck in the coming year. The person who finds the almond also gets a special present or treat. People all across northern Europe celebrate this fun tradition.\nVoice 4 \nGermany also has many wonderful Christmas food traditions. However, the sweetest of these is stollen. Stollen is a sweet bread. People have made stollen during the Christmas season for 600 years! In the 1400s, stollen was not very good-tasting. It was made of only flour, oil, water and yeast – for helping the bread rise. However, over many years, the recipe for stollen has changed and developed. Today, the German people make stollen with sugar, colorful dried fruit, nuts, spices, alcohol and a lot of butter.\nPeople make stollen in the shape of a long bread loaf. Then, they cover it with a sweet, white, sugar icing. The Bible says that after the baby Jesus was born, his parents covered him with white cloth. The stollen’s white icing represents this cloth. And the loaf represents the newborn Jesus.\nDuring the Christmas season, stollen fills Christmas markets around Germany. And there is a famous stollen festival in the town of Dresden!\nVoice 5 \nNext, we travel to several European countries to learn about their Christmas Eve meals. In the country of Italy, many people do not eat red meat in the weeks before Christmas. They are waiting for the celebration of Christmas. On the day before Christmas, they eat a special meal that does not include meat. It is called the Feast of the Seven Fishes. In the Bible, the number seven represents perfection or completion. This meal completes the season of preparation for Christmas.\nIn Russia and many other Eastern European countries people also celebrate a special meal on Christmas Eve. The meal includes 12 different foods. The 12 dishes are usually fish and vegetables. The number 12 represents Jesus’ twelve disciples and the end of the 12-month year. Many other parts of the meal represent parts of the Christmas story, when Jesus was born. Some people call this Christmas Eve meal the “Holy Supper.”\nVoice 6 \nOur next Christmas food is popular all over the Spanish- speaking world. It is called rosca de reyes. This means “King’s ring”. From Spain to Mexico to South America, people make, buy, and eat King’s ring. They celebrate the end of the Christmas season, called Epiphany.\nLike stollen, King’s ring is a sweet bread. However, King’s ring is large and round with a hole in the middle. People decorate the ring with colorful, sweet dried fruits and candies. But, the most special thing about the King’s ring is what is INSIDE it.\nEvery King’s ring has a small figure hidden in it. It is a symbol of the baby Jesus. Everyone wants to get the piece of the King’s ring with the baby Jesus figure in it. People believe it is a blessing. In some cultures, people bring the figure of Jesus to church with them later in the year. In other cultures, whoever gets the baby Jesus figure must cook the meal at the next holiday! Today, millions of people celebrate the end of the Christmas season with King’s ring.\nVoice 1 \nThese are just a few Christmas food traditions from around the world. But there are thousands more! And almost every person who celebrates Christmas has their own particular Christmas food traditions!\nWhat about you? Do you celebrate Christmas? If you do, what special foods do you eat during the Christmas season? If you do not celebrate Christmas, what foods do you make during your special holidays? You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThis time of year is special in many countries. Soon it will be Christmas. Christmas is the day when Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, but all kinds of people celebrate Christmas as a holiday. In today’s programme, we look back in history to a time before Jesus Christ was born. We think about the people who were waiting for someone to rescue them from their struggles. Their concerns were for the problems that were affecting them at that time. But the Christmas message goes beyond that. We consider how hope for a better future can help people in their present situation today – however difficult it is.\nVoice 3\n“A child is born to us. A son is given to us. God has given him the right to govern. People will call him a Wise Guide, powerful God, Father for ever, the Prince of Peace.”\nVoice 2\nThese words are from an English translation of the Bible. In fact they are from the older part of the Bible. This part of the Bible is important for both Jews and Christians. The original words were written in the Hebrew language, more than 2,500 years ago! But they were talking about future events. The man who wrote them was a prophet, a messenger of God. His name was Isaiah. Isaiah lived in the land of Judah – part of modern day Israel and the West Bank. Judah was ruled by one king after another. Some were good kings, but most were bad. When Isaiah wrote his words, Judah was about to be attacked by its enemies. The people were afraid. And so God told Isaiah these words to speak to the people:\nVoice 3\n“A child is born to us. A son is given to us. God has placed the right to govern in his hands.”\nVoice 1\nIsaiah’s words helped many of the people at that time. The promise of someone who would govern a kingdom of justice and peace was like a light in their darkness. In time, a new king came to power In Judah. His name was Hezekiah. He trusted God and saved his people from the attackers.\nVoice 2\nJewish belief is that Isaiah’s words were only about the good king, Hezekiah. But some of the words seem to go beyond describing any normal king – words like mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace. Not even a king could live up to these words.\nHowever, there is a second part to the Bible. This second part is part of the Christian Bible, but not the Jewish Bible. From this newer part of the Bible, Christians understand that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. We need to remember that Jesus was not born until seven hundred years after Isaiah. Christians believe that God gave these words to describe the birth and power of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not a normal ruler. He did not have a kingdom on earth. But Christians believe that Jesus is alive today in heaven. They believe he rules God’s kingdom – and he rules in their hearts. And they believe that Jesus will come again to earth, and he will be seen to rule over everything.\nVoice 1\nChristians remember the period of waiting before Jesus arrived, 2,000 years ago. They call it, ‘Advent’ – looking forward to the arrival of someone that people have long been hoping for. So, Advent also marks the Christian hope that Jesus Christ will come again.\nVoice 2\nAll this raises questions. How does anyone know that Jesus is ruling in their hearts? How does it show in the lives of normal Christians in the 21st century? Most Christians would say that their problems do not go away – but they say they can live with their difficulties, and still have inner joy and peace. They say they do not lose hope. Here is one example of this:\nFor the people of Zimbabwe, trusting God is the main thing that helps them survive. This southern African country has experienced severe economic problems. Local people lack necessary things such as clean water and bread. Yet in the middle of this difficult situation, some Zimbabwe Christians can still speak of their faith in God.\nVoice 1\nJoseph drank some water from a pipe, but he did not know that the pipe was broken, and the water was dirty. Since that time, he has suffered constantly from stomach problems. He talks honestly about his situation:\nVoice 4\n“What is my hope? That is a difficult question. I would say that God has got the answer to this situation. I know someone out there can help me. Someone can understand the problems I and my family face. Someone can give me some food, some clothes, some financial help. I think prayer can be an answer to all these questions. I would say so, because I believe in God.”\nVoice 1\nMannymore agrees with these words. He is a church leader in the town where Joseph lives. He says:\nVoice 5\n“We have tried to solve the problems ourselves. We have tried politics. It does not work. The only one who can help us is Jesus Christ. Often there seem to be no choices. But at those times he provides us with something to eat and something to drink.”\nVoice 2\nJoseph and Mannymore face huge problems. But they are waiting and living in hope of a better world – just like the people of Judah long ago. It is a time of advent for them.\nChristians traditionally remember Advent on the four weeks before December the 25th – Christmas Day. On each of the four Sundays in advent, there is a small ceremony. In the ceremony, someone lights a candle. They remember the people years ago, waiting for Jesus to come. And they remember people today who are waiting for him to come again. A fifth, gold candle is kept for Christmas Day. It represents Jesus, the light of hope shining in a dark world.\nVoice 1\nFor many Christians, Advent is a time to stop and think. It is a time of quiet before the busyness of Christmas celebrations. It is a time to remember the birth of Jesus. And it is a time to look forward to a better world. They may pray a prayer, such as this:\nVoice 3\n“Come, Lord Jesus – do not delay. Give new courage to your people who trust in your love. Amen.”\nVoice 1\nThe writers of today’s programme were Ruby Jones and Mike Procter. The producer was Ruby Jones. The voices you heard were from South Africa, Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom and the United States. All quotes were adapted for this programme.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n…5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Happy New Year!\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nEvery year on December 31st millions of people around the world stay up late. They stay awake until the clock turns to midnight. They do this to celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. When the clock reaches midnight, everyone cheers and shouts. Some people kiss someone they love. A New Year’s celebration can be a fun celebration with friends or family. It is a good time to think about the past. But it is also a good time to think about your hopes for the future.\nVoice 2\nHowever, did you know that if you live in a large city, such as San Francisco in the United States or London in England, you may see New Year’s celebrations all year? This is because people have come to these cities from all around the world. They bring their traditions and celebrations with them. And not everyone celebrates the new year on same day.\nVoice 1\nRussian people celebrate “Novy Gode” on January 14. The Assyrian New Year is called Kha b-Nisan. It is celebrated on April 1st. And people from Thailand celebrate the New Year in April as well. They call the celebration the Songkran Festival. Today’s Spotlight is on different New Year’s celebrations like these from around the world.\nVoice 2\nIn the country of Vietnam, people celebrate the new year with the holiday Tet Nguyen Dan, or «Tet» Holiday. This is the festival of first days. It marks the beginning of the lunar new year. This celebration is on different days each year. This is because the time of celebration is based on the moon. But it is usually around late January or early February.\nVoice 1\nDuring Tet, people often return to their family homes. It is important to begin a new year clean, happy, and full of good luck. So, people clean their homes. They pay debts. They may display a New Year’s tree in their home to keep away evil spirits. It can be a kumquat, peach, apricot or tangerine tree.\nVoice 2\nWhen the clock strikes midnight on the new year, people make as much noise as possible. They shout and hit drums or other instruments. They wish each other “chuc mung nam moi” or Happy New Year!\nVoice 1\nThe Persian New Year happens in the month of March. Three hundred million people around the world celebrate the Persian New Year, called “Nowruz”. Nowruz marks the beginning of the Iranian calendar. It is a 13 day-long celebration. Masoud is a Persian man living in London. He spoke to the BBC about what Nowruz means to him.\nVoice 3\n“For me, it has been brought down from the generations. We have been told about the culture of Iran. And the celebration of the new year. Which brings new life to spring into action for the year. And it is just a time to be full of joy!”\nVoice 2\nNowruz is a time for families to be together. People travel home if they are able. They set a table with seven special things that begin with the Persian letter S. This is called “Haft-sin”. Each thing represents something different. They may represent age, love, wealth, spring, new birth, health, and a sweet life. People wish each other “aidé shomā mobārak”. This means “Happy New Year!”\nVoice 1\nHindu people living in the south of India celebrate “Ugadi”. And Hindu people living in other parts of India celebrate “Gudi Padwa”. These celebrations are similar in many ways. There are two names because the people speak different languages. But during both celebrations, people create beautiful designs on floors called rangoli. They clean their houses and eat together with family. And of course, they wish each other “naye saal ki shubh-kamnaye” which means, happy new year.\nVoice 2\nRupa Vaitla lives in India. She believes these celebrations are important. She spoke to the website DeccanChronicle.com.\nVoice 4\n“Every celebration has its own meaning. It has been passed down from generations. They all have a story to tell. This is what makes us and our families grow stronger and closer. We must teach our children the importance of every festival. They are the ones to take our culture and history forward.”\nVoice 1\nThere are many other times that people celebrate a new year. Jewish people celebrate “Rosh Hashanah” at the end of September. Muslim people mark “Murharram” around the same time. People in Cambodia celebrate new year in April. People in Korea celebrate at the end of January. Each of these traditions are different. But many involve cleaning, family, food, and remembering the past.\nVoice 2\nWhen someone celebrates a different tradition then we do, it can make us feel separate and different from them. But it does not have to. In 2019, the Ethiopian New Year festival of Enkutatash was at the same time as the Chinese Autumn festival. Some Chinese people who were living and working in Ethiopia held a combined celebration. Kang Rongyao moved from China to Ethiopia for work. He told the website Xinhua:\nVoice 5\n“Celebrating the two events in one place together with my Ethiopian colleagues was a special experience. I was amazed and happy with the many traditions and cultural values of our two countries. They value a family connection. And the traditions of the celebration give me a look at the meaningful Ethiopian culture. I think it is in many ways similar to the Chinese culture.”\nVoice 1\nNew Year’s celebrations are a great time to think about your own life. You can think about the past year or the future year. It can also be a good time to think about people all around the world. People celebrate different things in different ways. But when we enter into a new tradition, we may be surprised to discover how similar we are to one another.\nVoice 2\nHave you ever celebrated a New Year of another culture?

She is cold and hungry. Where can she find help on a cold winter’s day?\nVoice 2\n“Matches! Light your fires with my matches! Would you like to buy some matches sir? What about you madam? They are the best kind! Strike them against any wall! They will burn! Someone must want some matches – anyone?”\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story. Hans Christian Anderson wrote this story. He wrote many children’s stories in the 1800s. People like to tell the story of the Little Match Girl during the Christmas season. Both adults and children enjoy it. But is it a sad story or a happy story? Liz Waid tells the story of the Little Match Girl.\nVoice 3\nA cold wind blows across the town. People hurry along, holding their warm coats close to their bodies. It is a cold winter! They will be happy to get home to their warm fires and nice food. Street sellers count their money at the end of the day. But for the little match girl, there is no money to count. No one wants to buy her matches. So, she is afraid to go home. Her father will beat her for sure.\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nThe little girl walks across the street. The snow falls on her long hair. She looks up at the tall, beautiful houses as she passes. She can hear people laughing inside. The smell of food cooking rises in the air. The people are preparing their last meal before the New Year. The little match girl walks to a quiet street corner. She sits down, holding her knees. She tries to pull her feet under her body. They are so cold. She has no shoes or coat. Her feet are blue from walking on the cold ground. Maybe she should go home? But even her home is not warm. Her family has no money.\nThe little girl puts her head in her hands. A tear wets the side of her face. If only she could be warm – for just a minute. Then, she has an idea – matches! She has her matches!\nHer father would be angry if she wasted any matches. But she only wants one, just one. Maybe it will warm her freezing fingers. The little girl gets a match. She strikes it against the wall – fire! The warm orange light shines in the darkness. The little girl looks hard at the small dancing fire. She imagines that she is sitting by a warm cooking oven. It seems so real! She can see the oven. She can feel its heat. She stretches her legs and warms her feet. How the fire burns! Then, the fire from the match goes out. The oven disappears. The little girl is once again in the cold darkness. Only the half-burnt match remains in her hand.\nThe little girl is so sad. Her happiness had come and gone so quickly. Maybe she could burn one more match? She takes another. And she strikes it against the wall. Fire lights up her sad face. She smiles. This time, she sees the wall become thin. It is almost like paper. She can see through it! Behind it, she sees a room. Such beauty! There is a huge table with hot food on it! She can almost taste the hot food. She reaches out for a little to feed her hungry stomach. But suddenly the fire from the match goes out. Once more, everything disappears. Only the grey wall remains before her.\nSo, the little girl strikes another match. The golden fire burns again. This time, she is under a huge Christmas tree! Beautiful bells and flowers hang from the tree. Lights shine from its green branches. It is the most beautiful tree she has ever seen! She reaches her hands toward the lights. Then, the match goes out. But the Christmas lights begin to change into stars in the sky. One of the stars falls back to earth.\nThe little girl thinks to herself,\nVoice 2\n“Someone must be dying”.\nVoice 3\nThe little girl starts to think of her dead grandmother. Her grandmother told her that when a star falls from the sky, a soul goes up to God. She misses her grandmother so much. The little girl lights another match.\nThis time, standing in the light, she sees her grandmother! Her grandmother was the only person who ever showed her love. She looks beautiful. The little girl cries:\nVoice 2\n‘Grandmother! Take me with you! I know when the fire goes out you will disappear! Please take me with you!’\nHinko Smrekar, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 3\nThe little girl takes all the matches. One by one she strikes them against the wall. She burns them quickly, so the picture does not disappear. The light shines brighter and brighter. It is as bright as day. She sees her grandmother more clearly. Her grandmother has never been so beautiful. The little girl reaches out to her grandmother. Her grandmother stretches out her arms to receive the little girl.\nThe grandmother takes the little girl in her arms. They fly together in joy high above the earth. There is no cold, hunger or fear. They are with God.\nIn the corner on the street, the little girl is leaning against the wall. She has red cheeks and a smiling mouth. But she is frozen. The New Year’s sun rises on the sad figure. The child sits there still and cold. She is holding a bundle of half-burned matches.\nOnly a few people walk on the quiet streets. They stop at the street corner. They see a small body on the ground. The people comment, “Poor thing. She was trying to keep warm,”\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nBut no one knew the beautiful things she had seen. They did not know how happy she was to be with her grandmother. She had gone happily into the New Year.\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story at Christmas time. It is an imaginary story. But people see many messages in it. Some people say the little match girl makes them think about people who have less than them. They think about people who may be poor or lonely at Christmas or the holidays. The story encourages them to help people in need.\nOther people see a message behind the pictures in the story. Each vision made the little match girl feel happy. But the picture she wanted to stay with her was the one of her grandmother. This was the only one that offered a different kind of happiness – love.\nUnconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God’s love and heaven – especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day — heaven.\nHave you heard this story before? Do you think this story was a sad story or a happy story?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nChildren\n‘Let me put the sheep in.’‘I want to put the wise men in.’‘Can I put the baby in?’\nVoice 1  \nThese children are not just playing. They are making something together. It is something they build every year. It helps them remember an important event. Many people around the world build something like this every year at Christmas. It is a Nativity scene.\nVoice 2  \nAt Christmastime they remember the story of the birth of one special baby, Jesus. He was born over 2000 years ago in a small town called Bethlehem. He was born in a stable, the place where animals were kept. The animals ate from a manger, or animal feed box. The baby used a manger as his crib or bed. Shepherds with their sheep visited him. And wise men from the East brought him gifts.\nVoice 1  \nAll of these things are included in this model of the night of Jesus’ birth. The Nativity scene contains small figures or statues of the baby Jesus, Mary his mother, and her husband Joseph. Figures of the animals and those who visited the baby are also included. People put nativity scenes in their homes to remember Jesus’ birth. Today’s Spotlight is on nativity scenes.\nPhoto by Myriam Zilles on Unsplash\nVoice 2  \nNaples, in Italy, is a city that is famous for making nativity scenes. The people of that city have used nativity scenes in churches for almost a thousand years. The nativity scenes from Naples are very special. Sometimes people build them in the shape of a tall triangle with a star at the top. A star guided the wise men from the East to Jesus. The nativity scenes always include Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus. But they also have lots of extra every-day people and objects. The largest nativity scene in the world is in Naples. It has 162 people, 80 animals, angels and about 450 smaller objects.\nVoice 1  \nNativity scenes are also very important in the country of Malta. Maltese people first built them in the 17th century. An organisation called the ‘Friends of the Crib’ was formed in Malta in 1986. It has over 500 members. In the weeks before Christmas the Friends organise a show of about 100 nativity scenes. They are in all shapes and sizes. Some even contain mechanical figures that move.\nVoice 2  \nIn some countries the figures in nativity scenes move for a different reason. They move because they are alive! They are part of living nativity scenes. In Spain many towns create these living nativity scenes. Local people dress up as people from the story of Jesus’ birth. They act different parts of the story. The main nativity scene is always the birth of the baby Jesus.\nVoice 1  \nLiving nativity scenes are also popular in Italy. In both countries some living nativity scenes are simple and basic. In other towns living nativity scenes are larger. Several hundred people may take part. They perform as characters from the story and people who lived in the town. And the performances can take place in the streets. Many people enjoy visiting these living nativity scenes.\nVoice 2  \nSome of these living nativity scenes are even famous. Over 100,000 people visit the island of Gozo in the weeks around Christmas. They come to this small island off Malta to experience a very special living nativity. Franco Ciangura is the mayor of the village of Ghajnsielem. He told the Guardian about the long tradition of building nativity scenes on the island.\nVoice 3  ‘\nFor generations, making nativity scenes has been a big thing at Christmas. Every home in Gozo has one. Sometimes they take up a whole room in the house. Families start making them in early December.’\nVoice 1  \nBut in 2008 Mayor Ciangura and the people of his village did something amazing. And they have done it every year since then. They created a life-size nativity scene. But they also created more. They created a whole village. They made a model of the village of Bethlehem from 2000 years ago. They built the ‘Bethelehem’ village on fields near their own village. It covers a large area of over 20,000 square metres.\n“Nativity scene, birth of Jesus” (CC BY 2.0) by wuestenigel\nVoice 2  \nThis ‘Bethlehem’ village looks very natural. People perform real jobs. A real baker and his wife make bread. A real carpenter works with wood. He is happy to talk to visitors about his work as he uses tools such as a lathe. This ‘Bethlehem’ also has a market that sells fresh fruit, vegetables and fish. And people can meet friends and eat and drink at the village inn. It looks like any normal village would from 2000 years ago. Mayor Ciangura told the Guardian newspaper why the village is like this,\nVoice 3  \n‘People have criticised me for making it too ordinary or normal, but this is how it really was. It was just an ordinary village. And in a stable a baby was born. And few people noticed. Just like here, life was going on as normal all around.’\nVoice 1  \nBoth local people and visitors enjoy the ‘Bethlehem’ village experience. Some people even stay in the village overnight. The story of Jesus’ birth says that 2000 years ago Mary and Joseph stayed in a stable. That is because there was no room for them anywhere else. But there is room for visitors today.\nVoice 2  \nAnd just like in Bethlehem 2000 years ago a baby is in a stable. In fact, more than one newborn baby plays the part of the baby Jesus. When Jesus was born, no one knew who he was – except the people represented in the nativity scene. He was just another baby. But in this living nativity Bethlehem everyone notices the baby. They know he is the reason people are celebrating. The baby born 2000 years ago is the reason for the celebration of Christmas.\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever seen a Christmas nativity scene?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nSomewhere in the world, a farmer plants many seeds into a field. The farmer waters the fields. Soon, after sun, water, and time, the seeds grow into large plants. They are fruits, or vegetables or grain. The plants are full and ready to be used. It is time to take the fruit or vegetable or grain from the plant. It is time for the harvest.\nVoice 2  \nThe harvest comes at the end of the growing season. This is usually a time when people have enough good food to eat. They eat as much as they want. They prepare and save some for the future when food is rare. But people also do something else at harvest time – they celebrate!\nVoice 1  \nPeople around the world celebrate the harvest during harvest festivals. During these festivals they eat good food. But they also give thanks for the great harvest. In today’s Spotlight, we will look at some of the ways people around the world celebrate the harvest and give thanks!\nVoice 2  \nPeople have been celebrating the harvest for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans both celebrated the harvest. Ancient Greeks worshipped many gods and goddesses. They held a harvest festival to thank and honor their goddess Demeter. Ancient Romans worshipped a similar goddess called Cerelia. During these festivals, people gathered together to eat and drink. They played games and danced. They brought offerings of food to the goddesses. They hoped that their offerings would please the goddesses so they would have another good harvest the next year.\nVoice 1  \nToday, people still celebrate the harvest. They still show thanks for the food that grows from the ground.\nVoice 2  \nIn Argentina, in the Mendoza Province, people celebrate the National Grape Harvest Festival. This province grows the fruit grapes. These grapes will be made into wine. Through December, January and February there are special events. One of these events happens on the last Sunday in February. It is a religious ceremony. The Archbishop of Mendoza puts holy water on the first grapes of the season. He thanks God for the harvest. The governor of the area also hits a plow – a tool for harvesting. This represents the end of the harvest. After this, people gather in the streets to watch parades. The celebrations end in early March. This is the main event. There is a show with lights, dancing and music. There are fireworks and even a beauty show. More than 20,000 people from all around the world attend this event.\nVoice 1  \nPeople in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is also called the Moon festival or Harvest Moon Festival. The Chinese have celebrated this festival for hundreds of years. It happens on the 15th day of the eighth month each year in the Chinese Han calendar. It is called the Moon Festival because the moon is very big and very bright at this time of year.\nVoice 2  \nThe moon is a symbol of unity. During this festival, people gather together with friends and family. They give thanks for the harvest. They give thanks for their relationships. Finally, they pray for a good future.\nVoice 1  \nDuring this festival, people also eat a food called Moon Cake. These cakes are round, like the moon. They are a symbol for coming together. People give these cakes to family members and friends. This is a wish for those people to have a long and happy life.\nVoice 2  \nAnother popular harvest festival happens in the United States. People there call it “Thanksgiving”. The origins of this holiday go back hundreds of years. There is no clear record of what truly happened. But the story begins with a group of Pilgrims. The Pilgrims were a group of people from Europe who went to live in North America. They had a very difficult time during their first year there and many of them died. The next year they finally had a good harvest. They were very thankful and they wanted to celebrate. They invited their Native American friends to eat with them. Together the two groups prepared and ate a huge meal of corn, fruits, vegetables, fish and meat.\nA painting called “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth”; (1914) By Jennie A. Brownscombe\n\nvia \nWikimedia Commons\nVoice 1  \nToday, in the United States Thanksgiving is a very important holiday. It happens on the last Thursday of November. Families gather together from far distances. They eat turkey meat, vegetables and sweet desserts. Some play American football and they go to parades.\nVoice 2  \nIn England, the Harvest Festival happens near the harvest moon. This tradition is very old. People in ancient England offered the first part of their harvest as a sacrifice to their fertility gods. Later, they used the last part of the harvest to make a doll. It was a symbol of the goddess of grain.\nVoice 1  \nEngland began celebrating their modern Harvest festival in 1853. That year, the leader of a church invited members of the church to a special event to give thanks. Today, people bring fruit and vegetables of the harvest into Christian churches to decorate them. They give food to people in the community who are hungry. It is a time to give thanks for food. It is also a time to share it with people who do not have enough food.\nVoice 2  \nMany countries around the world have harvest festivals. They give thanks for the food they have grown that year. They hope that the harvest will be as good or better the next year. Harvest time is also a good time to think about other things that people are thankful for – shelter, family, friends, health, love, and more.\nVoice 1  \nAt harvest time, who do we thank for these things? Many harvest festivals have religious importance. People thank God for providing for them. However, many people also show thankfulness to each other. People show thankfulness to other people in many different ways. They can write a note or tell a person thank you for a gift or act. Some people do good things for others who have done good things for them.\nVoice 2\nWhen you think about the harvest and giving thanks for it, whom do you thank? What are you thankful for? Where do the good things in your life come from?\nVoice 1  \nDo you celebrate a Harvest Festival in your culture? How do you celebrate? Are there special foods or ceremonies? Tell us about it.

                "content": "**Scroll down to listen to our conversation about this program**\nVoice 1 \nWelcome to Spotlight. I’m Liz Waid.\nVoice 2 \nAnd I’m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1 \nIt is Holy Week in Cuenca, a city in Ecuador. During this week, people prepare for the Christian holidays of Good Friday and Easter. Many people go to church. People who are very traditional even go to seven different churches in one day! People also prepare special food. They especially make fanesca. It is a tasty, thick soup, served in a round bowl. Today’s Spotlight is on fanesca.\nClick here to follow along on YouTube.\nVoice 2 \nThere are many good foods in Ecuador, but fanesca is a special holiday food. It represents many different traditions and symbols. Cooking and eating fanesca is often a family tradition. Jessi Franco is from Ecuador. He shared his thoughts on fanesca with Spotlight:\nVoice 3\n“My mom used to prepare the fanesca, but now she is too old. My older sister also knows how to prepare it. It is expensive with all the ingredients and quantities. I hope my sister prepares the fanesca this year and invites me!”\nVoice 1 \nPeople in Ecuador only eat fanesca during Holy Week. Holy Week is the week before the Christian holiday of Easter. It is the most important holiday for many Christians. This celebration happens every year in March or April. Easter is a time when Christians remember Jesus’ death and resurrection.\nVoice 2 \nJesus’ story comes from the Christian Bible. Jesus lived on earth more than 2,000 years ago. But the Christian Bible says that Jesus was not just a man. He was also God. He taught people about the love and peace of God. The authorities killed Jesus. But the Christian Bible teaches that, three days later, he rose again from the dead. In this way Jesus overcame sin and death.\nA Holy Week Parade in Quito, Ecuador; Cayambe, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 1 \nDuring Holy Week people remember the suffering that Jesus experienced when he was killed. Then at the end of this week, they celebrate his resurrection with the joyful holiday of Easter. It is a day of celebrating with traditional events and special food. People are full of happiness because they remember the new life that God gave them.\nVoice 2 \nChristians around the world have different traditions during Holy Week. Fanesca is one of these traditions. Fanesca is a kind of soup. It is made with many different foods. People use many different kinds of vegetables, such as sweet orange squash and corn. They also use many kinds of grains, like rice. And fanesca is famous for having many beans in it. These small seed-like foods are very healthy. Many kinds of beans grow in Ecuador.\nVoice 1 \nTo cook fanesca, people must first cook all the vegetables, grains and beans. They prepare each of these one at a time. They also prepare special fish called salt cod. Then, they mix everything together. They add milk to make the soup into a thick liquid. And at the end, people add the fish to the soup along with eggs and plantain bananas.\nMarcelo Gudino is a Spotlight listener. He says:\nVoice 4 \n“The fanesca soup is one of my favourite dishes. In Ecuador it is an old tradition to eat this food. We join with the family and everyone helps in some task. It takes a lot of work to make this soup. Finally all together we give thanks to God and enjoy it!”\nVoice 2\nMaking fanesca takes a lot of work and preparation. But preparing fanesca can be a fun family event. All the members of a family will join together to help make the soup. Each person has a job. One person may help by taking the corn off of the corn cob. Another person may take the skin off of the potatoes. Others may cut vegetables or cook the food.\nImage by kalhh from Pixabay\nVoice 1\nLayla Pujol has a website about Ecuadorian food. She now lives in the United States. But she says that preparing fanesca is a very important custom for her family. On her blog ‘Laylita’s Recipes’ she says:\nVoice 5 \n“As a child, I experienced all the local customs around Easter and helped prepare fanesca. Usually, the children had the job of peeling all the fresh beans and grains. I try to do the same with my children now. I want to make sure that they understand the real meaning of this holiday. I want them to learn about the customs that I grew up with in Ecuador. I have found that food is a great way to teach children about traditions and customs, especially if you involve them in the preparation of the food.”\nVoice 2 \nAfter the hard work of preparing the soup, everyone enjoys eating it together. People think fanesca tastes great! But for some people it is also part of the spiritual preparations for the Easter holiday. For the 40 days before Easter, some Ecuadorians do not eat any meat except fish. They do this to remember the suffering of Jesus. So fanesca is made with fish as a part of the fast before Easter.\nVoice 1 \nSome people also say that the fish has a symbolic meaning – it is an ancient symbol for Christ. The fish stands for the name ‘Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Saviour.’ Many people think that the grains and beans are also symbolic. Some people add exactly 12 different grains to their fanesca. Some Christians believe that these twelve grains represent the twelve disciples, or followers, of Jesus.\nBy JONAVIAG – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=71415716\nVoice 2 \nHoly Week is also around the time that farmers harvest many crops. This may be another reason why people eat fanesca at this time. During harvest season poor people would gather many grains and beans. They made fanesca because it is a very filling and healthy soup. The thick soup would fill people’s stomachs until they felt full. The people would then give thanks to God for providing for them.\nVoice 1 \nThese stories about fanesca are part of Ecuadorian tradition. In Ecuador, there are many traditions and cultures. They mix together, the same way fanesca is full of many different foods. Mixed together it tastes good and is very special. When people eat fanesca during Holy Week, they give thanks to God for all the many different but good things he gives us.\nVoice 1 \nThe writers of this program were Rebekah Schipper and Rena Dam.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nSeventeen hundred years ago, in the city of Rome, a man was put in prison. He was a Christian believer. And he had not obeyed the Emperor. He was sentenced to be executed. While this man was in prison, he met a young woman. She was the daughter of the prison guard. She visited this man’s prison cell often. They could not always talk together. So he and the woman began to pass notes to each other through the prison bars. They fell in love with each other. When it was time for the prison to execute the man, he sent her one last letter. The last note he sent to her was a love note. He ended it, “from, your Valentine.”\n\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 2  \nSome people believe that this is the story that started the holiday we now know as Valentine’s Day. All around the world people celebrate this holiday on February 14th. They celebrate it in many different ways. But the message is the same everywhere — love! Today’s Spotlight is on Valentine’s Day!\nVoice 1  \nNo one really knows if this story about the man, named Valentine, and the prison guard’s daughter is true. The holiday is actually named after at least two men, both named Valentine. Historians, people who study history, have little information about either of these men. Both men died because of their Christian faith – one died in 197 and one in 269. Historians believe that both men died on February 14th. Later, the Christian church recognized these men as saints — people of strong faith. And February 14th became Saint Valentine’s Day.\nVintage Valentine; Image by Oberholster Venita from Pixabay\nVoice 2  \nHistorical documents show that, originally, Valentine’s Day had little to do with love. A recorded link between Valentine’s Day and love did not appear until about 1,200 years later.\nVoice 1  \nIn 1382 Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a poem about love. He was a famous English Poet. The poem told about birds coming together half-way through the second month of the year. The birds met on Valentine’s Day, to mate. The poem influenced many people. And soon after, other writers began to use these ideas in their own writing. The link between Valentine’s Day and love became common!\nVoice 2  \nBy the 17th century, Valentine’s Day was celebrated all over Great Britain. About a hundred years later, people began to exchange small gifts or notes on Valentine’s Day. These gifts were an expression of love between family, friends, and lovers.\nVoice 1  \nToday, many people still celebrate Valentine’s Day in this way. They send a greeting card. These are usually just a simple paper note that expresses love or devotion. A person can send a Valentine’s Day greeting card to his lover, his parents, his co-worker, or even his doctor! In fact, the Greeting Card Association says that world-wide, people send over one billion greeting cards every Valentine’s Day!\nVoice 2  \nPeople in Canada, Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Australia all celebrate Valentine’s Day this way. But greeting cards are not the only thing people give or do. People may go out to a special dinner. They may buy each other a present, or just some good-tasting candy or chocolate. Other countries do different things.\nVoice 1  \nOn Valentine’s Day in Japan, women give sweet candy, chocolate or flowers to people they like. They call this chocolate ‘giri-choko.’ In Japanese, the word ‘giri’ means obligation, or, something someone must do. And ‘choko’ is a short form of the word for chocolate. A woman may also give ‘honmei-choko’ to a person she loves or is in a relationship with. Or she can give ‘tomo-choko’ to her friends.\nGiri-choko; “Happy valentines” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by chidorian\nVoice 2  \nThis may seem nice for the men. But men who received honmei-choko must also give the women a present. This happens on White Day, one month later. On that day, a man must give the woman a present worth two to three times more than the present he got! Sora News 24 is a Japanese news site. It shared results of a survey about this tradition. Most men do not like it. In the survey, one Japanese man wrote:\nVoice 3  \n“I like getting the chocolates. But I hate having to buy every girl something in return. Honmei-choco is even worse, because you have to buy something super expensive on White Day!”\nVoice 1  \nIn Finland they celebrate ‘Friend’s Day’ on February 14. This is not only a day for people in love. But, it is a day for celebrating and remembering your friends.\nVoice 2  \nSome places do not celebrate Valentine’s Day at all. But they do celebrate a different day for love. People living in Brazil celebrate ‘Boyfriend or Girlfriend Day.’ On June 12th, people in love exchange gifts like chocolates, cards, flowers, and even special clothes. Some women even use this day to perform special customs. They believe these customs will help them find a good boyfriend or husband.\nVoice 1  \nColombians celebrate ‘Love and Friendship Day’ on the 3rd Friday and Saturday in September. And many groups of people join in a popular tradition called ‘amigo secreto’ or ‘secret friend.’ Each member of the group chooses another member’s name by chance. He gives the person he chose a gift on this day.\nVoice 2  \nSo, people in different places celebrate a day like Valentine’s Day. They may celebrate it at a different time of the year. They may give gifts or greeting cards. They may write a special note to many people or to only one person. But there is a common idea in all of these actions. Valentine’s Day is a time to think about the people around you. It is a time to think about the people you love.\nImage by Gennaro Leonardi from Pixabay\nVoice 1  \nIt is important for people to feel loved. But often, we do not express our love for the people around us. So, Valentine’s Day offers people the perfect chance to tell other people how much you value them. Tell your wife or husband, or girlfriend or boyfriend how much you love them. Tell your parents or children how wonderful they are. Tell your friends how much you like to see them.\nVoice 2  \nDo you love someone? You should tell them! Then, tell US about what makes them so wonderful! You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nIn today’s Spotlight we tell a famous story. In fact, it may be the most famous story in history! This is the Christmas Story. It is about the birth of a special baby. The story begins 2,000 years ago in the small town of Nazareth in ancient Israel.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nNarrator  \nAt that time, a man named Caesar Augustus was the leader of the Roman Kingdom. Augustus wanted officials to count each person of his kingdom. So he ordered a census. Each family in the kingdom had to return to its home town. A man named Joseph lived in the town of Nazareth. Joseph was engaged to a woman named Mary. Soon, they would be married. Joseph’s family was from the town of Bethlehem. So Joseph and Mary had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem.\nImage by Ambroz from Pixabay\nThis trip from Nazareth to Bethlehem was long. And Mary was very pregnant. She would have a baby very soon. So Mary and Joseph had to travel slowly. As they travelled, Mary remembered a time before she was pregnant. One day about a year ago, an angel had visited her. This messenger of God called himself Gabriel. Gabriel said:\nGabriel  \n“Mary! You are truly blessed. God is with you.”\nNarrator  \nMary was surprised and frightened. But the angel said:\nGabriel  \n“Do not be afraid! God is very pleased with you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. He will be great and people will call him the Son of the Most High God. The Lord God will make him a king. He will rule forever over his people. His Kingdom will never end.”\nNarrator  \nMary was engaged to Joseph. But she was not married. They had never had sex. Mary wondered how she would become pregnant. But the angel said:\nGabriel  \n“God’s Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come over you. Because of this, the child will be holy. People will call him the Son of God.”\nNarrator  \nMary answered the angel simply.\nMary    \n“I serve the Lord. May it happen to me just as you said it would.”\nNarrator  \nNow Mary was pregnant, and travelling to Bethlehem. After almost a week, they finally arrived.\nJoseph began to look for a place to stay. He asked a man in a house nearby.\nJoseph  \n“I am Joseph. This is Mary. We are in Bethlehem to be counted in the census. And we are looking for a place to rest for the night. Can we stay here, in one of your empty rooms?”\nNarrator  \nThe man told him:\nInnkeeper 1\n“No, we have no room for visitors.”\nNarrator  \nJoseph continued to ask for a room at many houses. But no one had any room for the tired couple. Finally, one man told them:\nInnkeeper 2  \n“I see that the woman is very pregnant. We do not have any room inside the house. However, you can stay outside in our stable. It is not a comfortable room. This is where our animals stay. But, it will be a shelter and you can find some soft straw to lie on.”\nNarrator  \nJoseph and Mary agreed to stay in the man’s stable. In one corner there was a small manger. The manger held hay, a kind of grass, for the animals to eat. While Mary and Joseph were there, the time came for Mary’s baby to be born.\nMary    \n“Joseph it’s time! This baby will be born tonight!”\nJoseph  \n“Are you sure?!”\nMary    \n“Yes! Hurry! I am sure tonight will be the night! \nNarrator  \nIt was late at night. The stars shined brightly over the stable. Finally, Mary’s baby was born. Mary praised God for the gift of a healthy baby. She tied cloth around him to keep him warm. There was no place to lay him, so Mary laid him in the manger. The soft hay grass was the baby’s bed. Joseph and Mary named the baby Jesus.\nImage by Philip Walenga from Pixabay\nOn the same night, in a different part of Bethlehem there was a group of shepherds. They were watching their flocks of sheep. The shepherds settled down for the night. While some of the shepherds slept, others stayed awake to watch the sheep. Suddenly, a heavenly angel appeared in the sky. God’s light shined all around them. The shepherds were extremely frightened.\nShepherd 1  \n“What is that!?”\nShepherd 2   \n“I have never seen anything like that before!”\nShepherd 1   \n“Hide!”\nShepherd 2  \n“No, stay here, the angel is about to speak!”\nHeavenly Angel   \n“Do not be afraid! I am here to announce a great and joyful event. This event will bless all people around the world. A savior has just been born in Bethlehem. The savior will be the Messiah and King. Go and look for him. This is what you will look for: a baby wrapped in a blanket and lying in a manger.\nNarrator  \nImmediately, a large crowd of angels appeared. The angels sang “Glory to God in the heavenly heights, Peace to all men and women on earth who please him!” The shepherds were amazed by the angels.\nWhen the angels left them, they began to talk.\nShepherd 1   \n“We must go to Bethlehem!”\nShepherd 2   \n“Yes! We need to see this savior who has been born!”\nNarrator  \nSo the shepherds left their sheep. They began running toward Bethlehem to find the new baby. They searched everywhere. Finally, they found Mary and Joseph. They found the baby, Jesus, wrapped in cloth and lying in the manger. They fell to their knees to worship the newly born baby.\nAs the shepherds left, they praised God. They told everyone they met about what the angels had said about the baby. Everyone who heard their story was amazed.\nIn the small stable, Mary comforted her new baby. She held him close. She would remember this special night through her whole life.\nImage by janeb13 from Pixabay\nHost \nThis is the amazing story of Jesus’ birth. Every year at Christmas, Christians celebrate this event. They tell this story. Children and adults perform the story in plays. They tell it again and again to remember why they celebrate the holiday of Christmas.\nBut, Christians know that the Christmas story is only the beginning of a larger story. When Jesus grew up, he was a great teacher. He lived a perfect life. And he did many miracles. Jesus was not just any man. Jesus was God’s son. He was born on earth to save people from their sins – all the wrong things they do. This is the miracle Christians celebrate at Christmas. Jesus, God’s son, came down to earth as a weak and helpless baby. But, just as the angels said, he would sacrifice himself for all people, around the world. That is the true meaning of the Christmas story.\nThis telling of the Christmas story is based on Luke chapter 2. You can find our programs on the internet at www.radioenglish.net. This program is called ‘The Christmas Story’.\nWe hope you can join us again for the next Spotlight program. Goodbye.\nQuestion:\nHave you heard the Christmas story before? Do you celebrate Christmas? Tell us about it in the comments.\n"

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3  \nIt was the night before Christmas, When all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nThat is the beginning of a famous Christmas poem. It is called A Visit from Saint Nicholas, by Clement C. Moore. The poem describes a house on the night before Christmas. Nothing is moving, not even a small brown mouse. The family has hung stockings by the fire. Usually, they wear these stockings on their feet. But tonight, they hope that Saint Nicholas will come and fill their stockings with sweet treats and gifts. The poem continues, and tells a story about a father who sees Saint Nicholas bring these gifts to his house during the night.\nVoice 2  \nMany countries around the world have stories about Saint Nicholas. The stories are based on a real man called Saint Nicholas. Over time the details of the stories change. They are no longer real stories from history. But the stories explain different Christmas traditions. Today’s Spotlight is on the many Christmas stories about Saint Nicholas.\nVoice 1  \nThe real Saint Nicholas was born during the third century in a village near Myra, which is now in Turkey. His parents were very devoted followers of Jesus. And they raised their son to be a follower of Jesus too. When Nicholas was young, his parents died from disease. But he remembered the values his parents taught him.\nVoice 2  \nAs an adult, Nicholas remembered one particular teaching from the Christian Bible. It was to care for poor and sick people. In the Christian Bible, Jesus tells his followers to sell their things and give to the poor. Nicholas could not forget these words. He gave away lots of his money to the poor. And he helped people who were sick or suffering. There are many stories about his secret giving. It is not clear if these stories are true. But they show how much he cared for poor people. Nick Page tells one version of one of the most famous stories.\nNick Page\nA father had three daughters. At that time, there was a custom for marriage – a dowry. The father offered a gift to the man who wanted to marry his daughter. Without this gift, it was not likely for a woman to find a husband. But the father was very poor. He did not have enough money for this custom. So he planned to sell one of his daughters. He thought if he did this he would be able to care for his other daughters.\nNicholas heard about the father’s problem. He went to the father’s house the night before the daughter was going to be sold. The daughter had washed her stockings and hung them by the fire to dry. Nicholas threw a small bag of gold into one of the stockings. Then he left. In the morning, the man discovered the gold. Now he did not need to sell his daughter. Instead he was able to find a husband for his daughter. In a year, it was time for his next daughter to be married. But the man was still poor. Once again, Nicholas came during the night. And again, he threw a bag of gold into a stocking.\nThe Life & Miracles of Saint NicholasArtist: Alexander Boguslawski\nFinally, when it was time for his third daughter to marry, the man waited. He wanted to know who was giving the gifts. For a final time, a bag of gold came through his window. This time, the man was ready. He ran out of the house and the person he saw was Nicholas. But Nicholas demanded that the man keep this knowledge a secret.\nVoice 1  \nOver time, Nicholas became well-known for his kind, generous giving. People also knew that he was a follower of Jesus. He even became a bishop — a religious leader — of the city of Myra. As a bishop, Nicholas continued to serve poor, sick, and suffering people. Years after he died, people wanted to honor him for devoting his life to God and caring for people. So they named him a saint.\nVoice 2\nMany countries have created stories about Saint Nicholas as a secret gift-giver. Often the stories are for children. Saint Nicholas considers how children have behaved all year. Then, he gives them good gifts for good behaviour and bad gifts for bad behaviour. These stories explain Christmas traditions. For example, in many European countries, children leave their shoes out for Saint Nicholas. They hope he will fill their shoes with treats.\nVoice 1  \nThere are also other stories about Saint Nicholas. In Greece, he is not a secret gift-giver. Instead, he is the saint who protects sailors. It is said that in bad weather, sailors would pray to Saint Nicholas. Then he would appear to them like a dream. He would guide them to safety and could make the storms go away.\nVoice 2  \nIt is not clear exactly when Saint Nicholas died. But many people believe that he died in the year 343 A.D. He was then buried in the city of Myra. Because of his goodness, many religious people travelled to the place he was buried. But during the 11th century, there was war in the area of Myra. A group of sailors used the war as a chance to steal the bones of Saint Nicholas. They brought them to Bari, Italy. That is where Saint Nicholas is buried today.\nVoice 1  \nIf you believe the stories, Saint Nicholas is the Christmas saint. In many European countries, he is called Saint Nicholas. In Italy he is San Nicola. In the Netherlands they call him Sinterklaas. In the United States, he is Santa Claus. And in Britain, he is Father Christmas. He has many names, but the idea of the person is the same. He is a gift-giver who brings good cheer at Christmas time.\nErik Bro at Dutch Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2  \nBut Saint Nicholas believed in a very different kind of Christmas gift. Christians like Saint Nicholas celebrate Christmas as a time to remember Jesus’ birth. Christians believe that Jesus was a gift to the world. They believe he was both God and human. And because Jesus lived as a human, he knows what it is like to have pain and hurt, joys and happiness. Christians believe that in Jesus’ birth, God comes to earth. God brought the gift of hope to a broken world.\nVoice 1  \nDoes your culture celebrate a Christmas Saint? What stories have you heard about Saint Nicholas? You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 1  \nDo you know the story of Santa Claus? It is one of the most popular Christmas stories. He brings toys and gifts to good girls and boys. He flies in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer. The story of Santa Claus has changed over the years. It has been told in books, films, and music.\nVoice 2  \nIn 1939 Robert L. May wrote a new story about Santa Claus. This story soon became a well-known part of the story, or legend, of Santa Claus. This story has now been told in books and films. It is also a song. The song has even become one of the most popular Christmas songs of all time. Do you recognize it? Today’s Spotlight tells the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nReal reindeer live in groups in forests. They live in very cold places. They have large antlers made of bone on their heads. But in this story, reindeer can also fly! They guide Santa’s sleigh on the night before Christmas.\nVoice 2  \nRudolph was a young reindeer. He wanted to play games and climb trees with other reindeer. But the other reindeer did not let him. Instead, they called him names. That is because Rudolph was not like all the other reindeer. Their noses were black or brown. But his nose was red. And it was like a bright light. A bright, red, light. The other reindeer would say,\nVoice 3  \n“Ha ha! Look at Rudolph! Look at his nose! It is as red as an apple! But it is much too big! It is so bright that I cannot even look at it!”\nRankin/Bass Productions\nVoice 1  \nThese words made Rudolph cry. He knew that what they said was true. Still, he was a good reindeer. He listened to his parents. He tried to obey what they told him to do. But he was very lonely.\nVoice 2  \nOne year, on the day before Christmas, Rudolph felt excited. He went to sleep, knowing that Santa would come that night.\nVoice 1  \nBut Santa was having trouble. There was very bad weather. There was snow and fog. This would make it difficult for him to see where he was going. He would not see the stars or the moon. He would not know which way to go. He hoped he would be able to use house lights to guide his way. He was worried that he would not be able to reach all the boys and girls. But he called to his team of flying reindeer to come to him.\nVoice 4  \n“Come Dasher! Come Dancer! Come Prancer and Vixen! Come Comet! Come Cupid! Come Donner and Blitzen!”\nVoice 2  \nSanta loaded up his sleigh with toys and gifts. He connected each reindeer so they could pull together. Then off they all flew into the air. It took all of Santa’s skill not to get lost. But they crashed into the tops of trees. They almost hit an airplane as it flew through the clouds. Santa was able to continue to leave presents by using the lights from houses. But as house lights went out, it got darker and darker.\nVoice 1  \nThe next house he visited was Rudolph’s. It was very dark now. Santa fell down and hurt his knee. He fell down again. Now he was very worried that he would not be able to continue. Then he entered Rudolph’s room to leave a present. To his surprise he found light. It was not a lamp. It was a nose! This gave Santa a wonderful idea. He woke Rudolph from his sleep. Rudolph could not believe what he was seeing. Santa was here!\nVoice 2  \nSanta told Rudolph of all the trouble he was having. He told him about the fog and the dark. He told him about getting lost and crashing into trees. He told Rudolph how he was afraid that the boys and girls of the world would be sad if they woke without gifts. Then Santa asked Rudolph if he would help.\nRankin/Bass Productions\nVoice 4  \n“You may save the day. Your nose is so wonderful. I need you to help me tonight. To lead all my deer on the rest of our flight.”\nVoice 1  \nRudolph smiled. No one had ever said that his nose was wonderful – especially not someone as important as Santa Claus. For a reindeer, the best honor was to be chosen to pull Santa’s sleigh. Rudolph could not believe what was happening. He ran outside. He took his place in front of all the other reindeer.\nVoice 2  \nSoon, Santa was flying through the night again. Now he could go fast. Now they did not get lost or crash. They finished giving all the gifts just as the sun began to rise. All the other reindeer were just now waking up. But Rudolph was not in his bed! They wondered where he had gone.\nVoice 1  \nThen they heard the sound of bells. Santa and his reindeer flew out of the sky. Could it be? Was that Rudolph? Rudolph landed in front of the other reindeer. They had all called him names and not let him play with them. Now, Santa told all the reindeer that he had never seen a reindeer so brave as Rudolph. Santa told everyone that when it was dark or there was fog, Rudolph would lead the sleigh again.\nVoice 2  \nIn fact, this Christmas, if you listen carefully, you may hear them call, as they drive out of sight: Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!\nVoice 1  \nThe story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer has many versions. But in every story, one thing is the same. Rudolph learns to accept who he is. In the beginning, Rudolph has a part of himself that he does not like. He feels shame. But by the end of the story, it is that very thing that everyone celebrates!\nVoice 2  \nWe are all like Rudolph in some ways. We all have things about ourselves that we feel shame about or do not like. But this Christmas, maybe we can be a little more like Rudolph. We can find a way to shine our light and make the world a little brighter.\nVoice 1  \nTell us what you think about the story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1 \nChristmas is one of the few holidays celebrated all around the world. But every country has its own ways of celebrating Christmas. These celebrations pass from one generation to another to create special traditions. In this way, people of every age can enjoy the excitement and stories of Christmas.\nVoice 2 \nAll the different celebrations, traditions, and Christmas stories are also similar. This is because they are all based on one story. It is the story of the first Christmas — the day Jesus Christ was born. The word “Christ” was not part of his name. The word Christ is a special name for someone who would rescue people. It was a special name for a new kind of King.\nVoice 1 \nJesus was born in the ancient city of Bethlehem, in the Middle East. After he was born, a star appeared in the sky. At that time, there was a tradition about new stars. A new star appearing meant that a new king was born. A small group of important men lived very far away from Bethlehem. Today, many people call these men the Magi or the Wise Men. The Wise Men saw this star. They wanted to bring gifts to this new baby king. So they travelled to find the baby. They had to travel far. But a star is not a map. It does not give a perfect location. The Wise Men had to stop and ask if anyone had heard of a king being born.\nVoice 2 \nThis story is the starting point for our program today. It is a legend. It probably did not happen exactly as it is told. But it is a story that tells us something about the world or the way we should live. Today’s Spotlight is on the Russian Christmas legend of Babushka.\nVoice 1 \nThis Christmas story begins in the land that is now Southern Russia. It happened a long time ago on the night when Jesus was born. It was winter. Snow covered the earth. Ice covered the tree branches. And the cold wind blew. An old woman called Babushka was alone in her home. But she was happy that she had a fire to keep her warm. She did not have to go out into the cold.\nVoice 2 \nSuddenly, there was a noise at her door. Someone was knocking! When she opened the door, three old Wise Men were standing there. They were wearing the clothes of kings. They carried gifts and packages. They said to her,\nVoice 3 \n“Babushka, we have travelled from a far away country. We have stopped to tell you of the Christ-child who was born tonight in Bethlehem. He comes to rule the world. And he will teach all men and women to be loving and true. We are bringing him gifts.”\nVoice 1 \nBabushka invited the men to stay and get warm. She gave them hot food to eat. They told her about the star they were following. Babushka wished that she could see this little baby King. The men invited Babushka to come with them.\nVoice 3 \n“Come with us, Babushka! Then you can bring a gift of your own!”\nVoice 2 \nBut Babushka looked out the window at the cold night. She thought of going out into the cold. She decided that she did not want to leave her warm room. So the three men continued on alone in the cold winter night.\nVoice 1 \nBut that night Babushka could not sleep. She kept thinking about what the old men told her. She kept thinking about the wonderful chance they offered – to see the baby Jesus. Finally, she decided that in the morning she would go to see the Christ-child. And she hoped that on her way, she would see the old men.\nVoice 2 \nIn the morning, Babushka filled a container with gold balls, wood toys, and other play things for children. Then she put on her coat and went to see the baby Jesus. But Babushka remembered something. She had not asked the three Wise Men the way to Bethlehem. And now they had travelled so far during the night that she could not find them.\nVoice 1 \nBabushka decided to continue on. She hurried up and down many roads. And she asked every person she met,\nVoice 4 \n“I want to see the Christ-child. Where is he? I am bringing him beautiful toys.”\nVoice 1 \nBut no one could tell her the way. Each person told her,\nVoice 5 \n“Continue on Babushka, keep going.”\nVoice 2 \nSo Babushka kept travelling. She travelled for years and years. But she never found the child. In Russia, they say she is still travelling and looking for the baby Jesus. And every year, on the night before Christmas, she comes into the towns carrying her bag of toys. She enters each house when the children are sleeping. She holds a light close to the little children’s faces. She says,\nVoice 4 \n“Is he here? Is the baby Jesus here?”\nVoice 1 \nThen she shakes her head sadly. But she leaves a toy from her bag next to each sleeping child. Then Babushka continues on her way.\nVoice 2 \nPeople tell the story of Babushka every year at Christmas time. Often, these Christmas legends explain how a particular tradition began. The story of Babushka explains how presents appear while children sleep. Many cultures or countries have different legends that explain the mystery of surprise gifts. There is a story from Italy that is similar to Bubushka. It is called La Befana. Some parts are the same, but other parts are different.\nVoice 1 \nAnother story that explains the tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is the story of Saint Nicholas. This story has changed a lot from the story in the Bible. The most well- known version has become Santa Claus. But the Santa Claus story that is in films today has snow, elf helpers, and flying reindeer. This is a very different from the story of the Wise Men bringing gifts to a baby Jesus.\nVoice 2 \nStories like Babushka may not be true. But these stories are important. They help us explain traditions. They help us understand the world and make meaning of our lives.\nVoice 1 \nHave you heard this story of Babushka before?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nChristmas. It is the most celebrated holiday in the world. Around the world, over two billion people celebrate this holiday every year. Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ – an event that happened over 2,000 years ago.\nMost people in the world celebrate Christmas on December 25th. However, some Christians from countries like Russia, Egypt and Ethiopia celebrate Christmas on January 7th. Traditionally, the Christmas season lasts for 12 days. However, in many places, people celebrate only Christmas day and the day before, called Christmas Eve.\nAround the world, people follow many different Christmas traditions. But no matter how or when people celebrate Christmas, everyone celebrates with food! Today’s Spotlight is on Christmas foods from around the world.\nFood is an important part of most holiday celebrations. Large meals, or feasts, bring people together. And often, holiday foods represent what the holiday is about. Join Spotlight as we tell about these Christmas foods.\nVoice 2 \nIn the United Kingdom, people eat a large Christmas meal. When they are done, they eat a sweet dessert called Christmas pudding. Christmas pudding contains ingredients like dried fruit, alcohol, butter, sugar, eggs, flour and spices. Many people make Christmas pudding with 13 ingredients. This number has a religious meaning. It represents Jesus Christ and his 12 closest followers, called the disciples.\nTraditionally, people begin making Christmas pudding five weeks before Christmas! They begin by combining and steaming the pudding ingredients. Some people only mix the ingredients in one direction – from east to west. They do this to remember part of the Christmas story. The Christian Bible says that a group of wise men came from the east to see the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.\nAfter cooking the Christmas pudding, people let it set for a few weeks. On Christmas day, they cook it again. Often, they pour an alcohol called brandy over it and set it on fire. It is a beautiful thing to see.\nMillions of people in the United Kingdom eat Christmas pudding at Christmas. However, today, many people choose to buy it instead of make it.\nVoice 3 \nIn northern Europe, many people celebrate Christmas with another kind of pudding. In Iceland, it is called Mödnlugrautur. And in Sweden, it is called Julgröt. This sweet pudding is made from rice, sugar, salt, milk and spices like cinnamon. In Denmark, people call it Risalamande and they serve it with a sweet fruit sauce on top.\nThis pudding is part of a Christmas game. The person that makes the pudding hides a whole almond nut in it. They serve the pudding to everyone at the end of the meal. Each person eats their pudding and hopes to find the almond in their bowl. Finding the almond means you will have good luck in the coming year. The person who finds the almond also gets a special present or treat. People all across northern Europe celebrate this fun tradition.\nVoice 4 \nGermany also has many wonderful Christmas food traditions. However, the sweetest of these is stollen. Stollen is a sweet bread. People have made stollen during the Christmas season for 600 years! In the 1400s, stollen was not very good-tasting. It was made of only flour, oil, water and yeast – for helping the bread rise. However, over many years, the recipe for stollen has changed and developed. Today, the German people make stollen with sugar, colorful dried fruit, nuts, spices, alcohol and a lot of butter.\nPeople make stollen in the shape of a long bread loaf. Then, they cover it with a sweet, white, sugar icing. The Bible says that after the baby Jesus was born, his parents covered him with white cloth. The stollen’s white icing represents this cloth. And the loaf represents the newborn Jesus.\nDuring the Christmas season, stollen fills Christmas markets around Germany. And there is a famous stollen festival in the town of Dresden!\nVoice 5 \nNext, we travel to several European countries to learn about their Christmas Eve meals. In the country of Italy, many people do not eat red meat in the weeks before Christmas. They are waiting for the celebration of Christmas. On the day before Christmas, they eat a special meal that does not include meat. It is called the Feast of the Seven Fishes. In the Bible, the number seven represents perfection or completion. This meal completes the season of preparation for Christmas.\nIn Russia and many other Eastern European countries people also celebrate a special meal on Christmas Eve. The meal includes 12 different foods. The 12 dishes are usually fish and vegetables. The number 12 represents Jesus’ twelve disciples and the end of the 12-month year. Many other parts of the meal represent parts of the Christmas story, when Jesus was born. Some people call this Christmas Eve meal the “Holy Supper.”\nVoice 6 \nOur next Christmas food is popular all over the Spanish- speaking world. It is called rosca de reyes. This means “King’s ring”. From Spain to Mexico to South America, people make, buy, and eat King’s ring. They celebrate the end of the Christmas season, called Epiphany.\nLike stollen, King’s ring is a sweet bread. However, King’s ring is large and round with a hole in the middle. People decorate the ring with colorful, sweet dried fruits and candies. But, the most special thing about the King’s ring is what is INSIDE it.\nEvery King’s ring has a small figure hidden in it. It is a symbol of the baby Jesus. Everyone wants to get the piece of the King’s ring with the baby Jesus figure in it. People believe it is a blessing. In some cultures, people bring the figure of Jesus to church with them later in the year. In other cultures, whoever gets the baby Jesus figure must cook the meal at the next holiday! Today, millions of people celebrate the end of the Christmas season with King’s ring.\nVoice 1 \nThese are just a few Christmas food traditions from around the world. But there are thousands more! And almost every person who celebrates Christmas has their own particular Christmas food traditions!\nWhat about you? Do you celebrate Christmas? If you do, what special foods do you eat during the Christmas season? If you do not celebrate Christmas, what foods do you make during your special holidays? You can leave a comment on our website.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nVoice 1\nThis time of year is special in many countries. Soon it will be Christmas. Christmas is the day when Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, but all kinds of people celebrate Christmas as a holiday. In today’s programme, we look back in history to a time before Jesus Christ was born. We think about the people who were waiting for someone to rescue them from their struggles. Their concerns were for the problems that were affecting them at that time. But the Christmas message goes beyond that. We consider how hope for a better future can help people in their present situation today – however difficult it is.\nVoice 3\n“A child is born to us. A son is given to us. God has given him the right to govern. People will call him a Wise Guide, powerful God, Father for ever, the Prince of Peace.”\nVoice 2\nThese words are from an English translation of the Bible. In fact they are from the older part of the Bible. This part of the Bible is important for both Jews and Christians. The original words were written in the Hebrew language, more than 2,500 years ago! But they were talking about future events. The man who wrote them was a prophet, a messenger of God. His name was Isaiah. Isaiah lived in the land of Judah – part of modern day Israel and the West Bank. Judah was ruled by one king after another. Some were good kings, but most were bad. When Isaiah wrote his words, Judah was about to be attacked by its enemies. The people were afraid. And so God told Isaiah these words to speak to the people:\nVoice 3\n“A child is born to us. A son is given to us. God has placed the right to govern in his hands.”\nVoice 1\nIsaiah’s words helped many of the people at that time. The promise of someone who would govern a kingdom of justice and peace was like a light in their darkness. In time, a new king came to power In Judah. His name was Hezekiah. He trusted God and saved his people from the attackers.\nVoice 2\nJewish belief is that Isaiah’s words were only about the good king, Hezekiah. But some of the words seem to go beyond describing any normal king – words like mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace. Not even a king could live up to these words.\nHowever, there is a second part to the Bible. This second part is part of the Christian Bible, but not the Jewish Bible. From this newer part of the Bible, Christians understand that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. We need to remember that Jesus was not born until seven hundred years after Isaiah. Christians believe that God gave these words to describe the birth and power of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not a normal ruler. He did not have a kingdom on earth. But Christians believe that Jesus is alive today in heaven. They believe he rules God’s kingdom – and he rules in their hearts. And they believe that Jesus will come again to earth, and he will be seen to rule over everything.\nVoice 1\nChristians remember the period of waiting before Jesus arrived, 2,000 years ago. They call it, ‘Advent’ – looking forward to the arrival of someone that people have long been hoping for. So, Advent also marks the Christian hope that Jesus Christ will come again.\nVoice 2\nAll this raises questions. How does anyone know that Jesus is ruling in their hearts? How does it show in the lives of normal Christians in the 21st century? Most Christians would say that their problems do not go away – but they say they can live with their difficulties, and still have inner joy and peace. They say they do not lose hope. Here is one example of this:\nFor the people of Zimbabwe, trusting God is the main thing that helps them survive. This southern African country has experienced severe economic problems. Local people lack necessary things such as clean water and bread. Yet in the middle of this difficult situation, some Zimbabwe Christians can still speak of their faith in God.\nVoice 1\nJoseph drank some water from a pipe, but he did not know that the pipe was broken, and the water was dirty. Since that time, he has suffered constantly from stomach problems. He talks honestly about his situation:\nVoice 4\n“What is my hope? That is a difficult question. I would say that God has got the answer to this situation. I know someone out there can help me. Someone can understand the problems I and my family face. Someone can give me some food, some clothes, some financial help. I think prayer can be an answer to all these questions. I would say so, because I believe in God.”\nVoice 1\nMannymore agrees with these words. He is a church leader in the town where Joseph lives. He says:\nVoice 5\n“We have tried to solve the problems ourselves. We have tried politics. It does not work. The only one who can help us is Jesus Christ. Often there seem to be no choices. But at those times he provides us with something to eat and something to drink.”\nVoice 2\nJoseph and Mannymore face huge problems. But they are waiting and living in hope of a better world – just like the people of Judah long ago. It is a time of advent for them.\nChristians traditionally remember Advent on the four weeks before December the 25th – Christmas Day. On each of the four Sundays in advent, there is a small ceremony. In the ceremony, someone lights a candle. They remember the people years ago, waiting for Jesus to come. And they remember people today who are waiting for him to come again. A fifth, gold candle is kept for Christmas Day. It represents Jesus, the light of hope shining in a dark world.\nVoice 1\nFor many Christians, Advent is a time to stop and think. It is a time of quiet before the busyness of Christmas celebrations. It is a time to remember the birth of Jesus. And it is a time to look forward to a better world. They may pray a prayer, such as this:\nVoice 3\n“Come, Lord Jesus – do not delay. Give new courage to your people who trust in your love. Amen.”\nVoice 1\nThe writers of today’s programme were Ruby Jones and Mike Procter. The producer was Ruby Jones. The voices you heard were from South Africa, Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom and the United States. All quotes were adapted for this programme. This programme is called, “Advent.”\nVoice 2\nThank you for joining us today. Goodbye.\nQuestion:\nChristians in many countries will celebrate Christmas this month. Do you celebrate Christmas? Are there Christmas decorations where you live? What kind of things do you see?\n\n\n\n\n"

She is cold and hungry. Where can she find help on a cold winter’s day?\nVoice 2\n“Matches! Light your fires with my matches! Would you like to buy some matches sir? What about you madam? They are the best kind! Strike them against any wall! They will burn! Someone must want some matches – anyone?”\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story. Hans Christian Anderson wrote this story. He wrote many children’s stories in the 1800s. People like to tell the story of the Little Match Girl during the Christmas season. Both adults and children enjoy it. But is it a sad story or a happy story? Liz Waid tells the story of the Little Match Girl.\nVoice 3\nA cold wind blows across the town. People hurry along, holding their warm coats close to their bodies. It is a cold winter! They will be happy to get home to their warm fires and nice food. Street sellers count their money at the end of the day. But for the little match girl, there is no money to count. No one wants to buy her matches. So, she is afraid to go home. Her father will beat her for sure.\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nThe little girl walks across the street. The snow falls on her long hair. She looks up at the tall, beautiful houses as she passes. She can hear people laughing inside. The smell of food cooking rises in the air. The people are preparing their last meal before the New Year. The little match girl walks to a quiet street corner. She sits down, holding her knees. She tries to pull her feet under her body. They are so cold. She has no shoes or coat. Her feet are blue from walking on the cold ground. Maybe she should go home? But even her home is not warm. Her family has no money.\nThe little girl puts her head in her hands. A tear wets the side of her face. If only she could be warm – for just a minute. Then, she has an idea – matches! She has her matches!\nHer father would be angry if she wasted any matches. But she only wants one, just one. Maybe it will warm her freezing fingers. The little girl gets a match. She strikes it against the wall – fire! The warm orange light shines in the darkness. The little girl looks hard at the small dancing fire. She imagines that she is sitting by a warm cooking oven. It seems so real! She can see the oven. She can feel its heat. She stretches her legs and warms her feet. How the fire burns! Then, the fire from the match goes out. The oven disappears. The little girl is once again in the cold darkness. Only the half-burnt match remains in her hand.\nThe little girl is so sad. Her happiness had come and gone so quickly. Maybe she could burn one more match? She takes another. And she strikes it against the wall. Fire lights up her sad face. She smiles. This time, she sees the wall become thin. It is almost like paper. She can see through it! Behind it, she sees a room. Such beauty! There is a huge table with hot food on it! She can almost taste the hot food. She reaches out for a little to feed her hungry stomach. But suddenly the fire from the match goes out. Once more, everything disappears. Only the grey wall remains before her.\nSo, the little girl strikes another match. The golden fire burns again. This time, she is under a huge Christmas tree! Beautiful bells and flowers hang from the tree. Lights shine from its green branches. It is the most beautiful tree she has ever seen! She reaches her hands toward the lights. Then, the match goes out. But the Christmas lights begin to change into stars in the sky. One of the stars falls back to earth.\nThe little girl thinks to herself,\nVoice 2\n“Someone must be dying”.\nVoice 3\nThe little girl starts to think of her dead grandmother. Her grandmother told her that when a star falls from the sky, a soul goes up to God. She misses her grandmother so much. The little girl lights another match.\nThis time, standing in the light, she sees her grandmother! Her grandmother was the only person who ever showed her love. She looks beautiful. The little girl cries:\nVoice 2\n‘Grandmother! Take me with you! I know when the fire goes out you will disappear! Please take me with you!’\nHinko Smrekar, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 3\nThe little girl takes all the matches. One by one she strikes them against the wall. She burns them quickly, so the picture does not disappear. The light shines brighter and brighter. It is as bright as day. She sees her grandmother more clearly. Her grandmother has never been so beautiful. The little girl reaches out to her grandmother. Her grandmother stretches out her arms to receive the little girl.\nThe grandmother takes the little girl in her arms. They fly together in joy high above the earth. There is no cold, hunger or fear. They are with God.\nIn the corner on the street, the little girl is leaning against the wall. She has red cheeks and a smiling mouth. But she is frozen. The New Year’s sun rises on the sad figure. The child sits there still and cold. She is holding a bundle of half-burned matches.\nOnly a few people walk on the quiet streets. They stop at the street corner. They see a small body on the ground. The people comment, “Poor thing. She was trying to keep warm,”\nHans Tegner, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nBut no one knew the beautiful things she had seen. They did not know how happy she was to be with her grandmother. She had gone happily into the New Year.\nVoice 1\nThe Little Match Girl is a popular story at Christmas time. It is an imaginary story. But people see many messages in it. Some people say the little match girl makes them think about people who have less than them. They think about people who may be poor or lonely at Christmas or the holidays. The story encourages them to help people in need.\nOther people see a message behind the pictures in the story. Each vision made the little match girl feel happy. But the picture she wanted to stay with her was the one of her grandmother. This was the only one that offered a different kind of happiness – love.\nUnconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God’s love and heaven – especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day — heaven.\nHave you heard this story before? Do you think this story was a sad story or a happy story?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\n\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube.\nChildren\n‘Let me put the sheep in.’‘I want to put the wise men in.’‘Can I put the baby in?’\nVoice 1  \nThese children are not just playing. They are making something together. It is something they build every year. It helps them remember an important event. Many people around the world build something like this every year at Christmas. It is a Nativity scene.\nVoice 2  \nAt Christmastime they remember the story of the birth of one special baby, Jesus. He was born over 2000 years ago in a small town called Bethlehem. He was born in a stable, the place where animals were kept. The animals ate from a manger, or animal feed box. The baby used a manger as his crib or bed. Shepherds with their sheep visited him. And wise men from the East brought him gifts.\nVoice 1  \nAll of these things are included in this model of the night of Jesus’ birth. The Nativity scene contains small figures or statues of the baby Jesus, Mary his mother, and her husband Joseph. Figures of the animals and those who visited the baby are also included. People put nativity scenes in their homes to remember Jesus’ birth. Today’s Spotlight is on nativity scenes.\nPhoto by Myriam Zilles on Unsplash\nVoice 2  \nNaples, in Italy, is a city that is famous for making nativity scenes. The people of that city have used nativity scenes in churches for almost a thousand years. The nativity scenes from Naples are very special. Sometimes people build them in the shape of a tall triangle with a star at the top. A star guided the wise men from the East to Jesus. The nativity scenes always include Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus. But they also have lots of extra every-day people and objects. The largest nativity scene in the world is in Naples. It has 162 people, 80 animals, angels and about 450 smaller objects.\nVoice 1  \nNativity scenes are also very important in the country of Malta. Maltese people first built them in the 17th century. An organisation called the ‘Friends of the Crib’ was formed in Malta in 1986. It has over 500 members. In the weeks before Christmas the Friends organise a show of about 100 nativity scenes. They are in all shapes and sizes. Some even contain mechanical figures that move.\nVoice 2  \nIn some countries the figures in nativity scenes move for a different reason. They move because they are alive! They are part of living nativity scenes. In Spain many towns create these living nativity scenes. Local people dress up as people from the story of Jesus’ birth. They act different parts of the story. The main nativity scene is always the birth of the baby Jesus.\nVoice 1  \nLiving nativity scenes are also popular in Italy. In both countries some living nativity scenes are simple and basic. In other towns living nativity scenes are larger. Several hundred people may take part. They perform as characters from the story and people who lived in the town. And the performances can take place in the streets. Many people enjoy visiting these living nativity scenes.\nVoice 2  \nSome of these living nativity scenes are even famous. Over 100,000 people visit the island of Gozo in the weeks around Christmas. They come to this small island off Malta to experience a very special living nativity. Franco Ciangura is the mayor of the village of Ghajnsielem. He told the Guardian about the long tradition of building nativity scenes on the island.\nVoice 3  ‘\nFor generations, making nativity scenes has been a big thing at Christmas. Every home in Gozo has one. Sometimes they take up a whole room in the house. Families start making them in early December.’\nVoice 1  \nBut in 2008 Mayor Ciangura and the people of his village did something amazing. And they have done it every year since then. They created a life-size nativity scene. But they also created more. They created a whole village. They made a model of the village of Bethlehem from 2000 years ago. They built the ‘Bethelehem’ village on fields near their own village. It covers a large area of over 20,000 square metres.\n“Nativity scene, birth of Jesus” (CC BY 2.0) by wuestenigel\nVoice 2  \nThis ‘Bethlehem’ village looks very natural. People perform real jobs. A real baker and his wife make bread. A real carpenter works with wood. He is happy to talk to visitors about his work as he uses tools such as a lathe. This ‘Bethlehem’ also has a market that sells fresh fruit, vegetables and fish. And people can meet friends and eat and drink at the village inn. It looks like any normal village would from 2000 years ago. Mayor Ciangura told the Guardian newspaper why the village is like this,\nVoice 3  \n‘People have criticised me for making it too ordinary or normal, but this is how it really was. It was just an ordinary village. And in a stable a baby was born. And few people noticed. Just like here, life was going on as normal all around.’\nVoice 1  \nBoth local people and visitors enjoy the ‘Bethlehem’ village experience. Some people even stay in the village overnight. The story of Jesus’ birth says that 2000 years ago Mary and Joseph stayed in a stable. That is because there was no room for them anywhere else. But there is room for visitors today.\nVoice 2  \nAnd just like in Bethlehem 2000 years ago a baby is in a stable. In fact, more than one newborn baby plays the part of the baby Jesus. When Jesus was born, no one knew who he was – except the people represented in the nativity scene. He was just another baby. But in this living nativity Bethlehem everyone notices the baby. They know he is the reason people are celebrating. The baby born 2000 years ago is the reason for the celebration of Christmas.\nVoice 1  \nHave you ever seen a Christmas nativity scene?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nIn today’s Spotlight we tell a famous story. In fact, it may be the most famous story in history! This is the Christmas Story. It is about the birth of a special baby. The story begins 2,000 years ago in the small town of Nazareth in ancient Israel.\nClick here to follow along with this program on YouTube\nNarrator  \nAt that time, a man named Caesar Augustus was the leader of the Roman Kingdom. Augustus wanted officials to count each person of his kingdom. So he ordered a census. Each family in the kingdom had to return to its home town. A man named Joseph lived in the town of Nazareth. Joseph was engaged to a woman named Mary. Soon, they would be married. Joseph’s family was from the town of Bethlehem. So Joseph and Mary had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem.\nImage by Ambroz from Pixabay\nThis trip from Nazareth to Bethlehem was long. And Mary was very pregnant. She would have a baby very soon. So Mary and Joseph had to travel slowly. As they travelled, Mary remembered a time before she was pregnant. One day about a year ago, an angel had visited her. This messenger of God called himself Gabriel. Gabriel said:\nGabriel  \n“Mary! You are truly blessed. God is with you.”\nNarrator  \nMary was surprised and frightened. But the angel said:\nGabriel  \n“Do not be afraid! God is very pleased with you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. He will be great and people will call him the Son of the Most High God. The Lord God will make him a king. He will rule forever over his people. His Kingdom will never end.”\nNarrator  \nMary was engaged to Joseph. But she was not married. They had never had sex. Mary wondered how she would become pregnant. But the angel said:\nGabriel  \n“God’s Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come over you. Because of this, the child will be holy. People will call him the Son of God.”\nNarrator  \nMary answered the angel simply.\nMary    \n“I serve the Lord. May it happen to me just as you said it would.”\nNarrator  \nNow Mary was pregnant, and travelling to Bethlehem. After almost a week, they finally arrived.\nJoseph began to look for a place to stay. He asked a man in a house nearby.\nJoseph  \n“I am Joseph. This is Mary. We are in Bethlehem to be counted in the census. And we are looking for a place to rest for the night. Can we stay here, in one of your empty rooms?”\nNarrator  \nThe man told him:\nInnkeeper 1\n“No, we have no room for visitors.”\nNarrator  \nJoseph continued to ask for a room at many houses. But no one had any room for the tired couple. Finally, one man told them:\nInnkeeper 2  \n“I see that the woman is very pregnant. We do not have any room inside the house. However, you can stay outside in our stable. It is not a comfortable room. This is where our animals stay. But, it will be a shelter and you can find some soft straw to lie on.”\nNarrator  \nJoseph and Mary agreed to stay in the man’s stable. In one corner there was a small manger. The manger held hay, a kind of grass, for the animals to eat. While Mary and Joseph were there, the time came for Mary’s baby to be born.\nMary    \n“Joseph it’s time! This baby will be born tonight!”\nJoseph  \n“Are you sure?!”\nMary    \n“Yes! Hurry! I am sure tonight will be the night! \nNarrator  \nIt was late at night. The stars shined brightly over the stable. Finally, Mary’s baby was born. Mary praised God for the gift of a healthy baby. She tied cloth around him to keep him warm. There was no place to lay him, so Mary laid him in the manger. The soft hay grass was the baby’s bed. Joseph and Mary named the baby Jesus.\nImage by Philip Walenga from Pixabay\nOn the same night, in a different part of Bethlehem there was a group of shepherds. They were watching their flocks of sheep. The shepherds settled down for the night. While some of the shepherds slept, others stayed awake to watch the sheep. Suddenly, a heavenly angel appeared in the sky. God’s light shined all around them. The shepherds were extremely frightened.\nShepherd 1  \n“What is that!?”\nShepherd 2   \n“I have never seen anything like that before!”\nShepherd 1   \n“Hide!”\nShepherd 2  \n“No, stay here, the angel is about to speak!”\nHeavenly Angel   \n“Do not be afraid! I am here to announce a great and joyful event. This event will bless all people around the world. A savior has just been born in Bethlehem. The savior will be the Messiah and King. Go and look for him. This is what you will look for: a baby wrapped in a blanket and lying in a manger.\nNarrator  \nImmediately, a large crowd of angels appeared. The angels sang “Glory to God in the heavenly heights, Peace to all men and women on earth who please him!” The shepherds were amazed by the angels.\nWhen the angels left them, they began to talk.\nShepherd 1   \n“We must go to Bethlehem!”\nShepherd 2   \n“Yes! We need to see this savior who has been born!”\nNarrator  \nSo the shepherds left their sheep. They began running toward Bethlehem to find the new baby. They searched everywhere. Finally, they found Mary and Joseph. They found the baby, Jesus, wrapped in cloth and lying in the manger. They fell to their knees to worship the newly born baby.\nAs the shepherds left, they praised God. They told everyone they met about what the angels had said about the baby. Everyone who heard their story was amazed.\nIn the small stable, Mary comforted her new baby. She held him close. She would remember this special night through her whole life.\nImage by janeb13 from Pixabay\nHost \nThis is the amazing story of Jesus’ birth. Every year at Christmas, Christians celebrate this event. They tell this story. Children and adults perform the story in plays. They tell it again and again to remember why they celebrate the holiday of Christmas.\nBut, Christians know that the Christmas story is only the beginning of a larger story. When Jesus grew up, he was a great teacher. He lived a perfect life. And he did many miracles. Jesus was not just any man. Jesus was God’s son. He was born on earth to save people from their sins – all the wrong things they do. This is the miracle Christians celebrate at Christmas. Jesus, God’s son, came down to earth as a weak and helpless baby. But, just as the angels said, he would sacrifice himself for all people, around the world. That is the true meaning of the Christmas story.\nThis telling of the Christmas story is based on Luke chapter 2. You can find our programs on the internet at www.radioenglish.net. This program is called ‘The Christmas Story’.\nWe hope you can join us again for the next Spotlight program. Goodbye.\nQuestion:\nHave you heard the Christmas story before? Do you celebrate Christmas? Tell us about it in the comments.\n"

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\nVoice 3  \nIt was the night before Christmas, When all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.\n\nFollow along on YouTube\nVoice 1  \nThat is the beginning of a famous Christmas poem. It is called A Visit from Saint Nicholas, by Clement C. Moore. The poem describes a house on the night before Christmas. Nothing is moving, not even a small brown mouse. The family has hung stockings by the fire. Usually, they wear these stockings on their feet. But tonight, they hope that Saint Nicholas will come and fill their stockings with sweet treats and gifts. The poem continues, and tells a story about a father who sees Saint Nicholas bring these gifts to his house during the night.\nVoice 2  \nMany countries around the world have stories about Saint Nicholas. The stories are based on a real man called Saint Nicholas. Over time the details of the stories change. They are no longer real stories from history. But the stories explain different Christmas traditions. Today’s Spotlight is on the many Christmas stories about Saint Nicholas.\nVoice 1  \nThe real Saint Nicholas was born during the third century in a village near Myra, which is now in Turkey. His parents were very devoted followers of Jesus. And they raised their son to be a follower of Jesus too. When Nicholas was young, his parents died from disease. But he remembered the values his parents taught him.\nVoice 2  \nAs an adult, Nicholas remembered one particular teaching from the Christian Bible. It was to care for poor and sick people. In the Christian Bible, Jesus tells his followers to sell their things and give to the poor. Nicholas could not forget these words. He gave away lots of his money to the poor. And he helped people who were sick or suffering. There are many stories about his secret giving. It is not clear if these stories are true. But they show how much he cared for poor people. Nick Page tells one version of one of the most famous stories.\nNick Page\nA father had three daughters. At that time, there was a custom for marriage – a dowry. The father offered a gift to the man who wanted to marry his daughter. Without this gift, it was not likely for a woman to find a husband. But the father was very poor. He did not have enough money for this custom. So he planned to sell one of his daughters. He thought if he did this he would be able to care for his other daughters.\nNicholas heard about the father’s problem. He went to the father’s house the night before the daughter was going to be sold. The daughter had washed her stockings and hung them by the fire to dry. Nicholas threw a small bag of gold into one of the stockings. Then he left. In the morning, the man discovered the gold. Now he did not need to sell his daughter. Instead he was able to find a husband for his daughter. In a year, it was time for his next daughter to be married. But the man was still poor. Once again, Nicholas came during the night. And again, he threw a bag of gold into a stocking.\nThe Life & Miracles of Saint NicholasArtist: Alexander Boguslawski\nFinally, when it was time for his third daughter to marry, the man waited. He wanted to know who was giving the gifts. For a final time, a bag of gold came through his window. This time, the man was ready. He ran out of the house and the person he saw was Nicholas. But Nicholas demanded that the man keep this knowledge a secret.\nVoice 1  \nOver time, Nicholas became well-known for his kind, generous giving. People also knew that he was a follower of Jesus. He even became a bishop — a religious leader — of the city of Myra. As a bishop, Nicholas continued to serve poor, sick, and suffering people. Years after he died, people wanted to honor him for devoting his life to God and caring for people. So they named him a saint.\nVoice 2\nMany countries have created stories about Saint Nicholas as a secret gift-giver. Often the stories are for children. Saint Nicholas considers how children have behaved all year. Then, he gives them good gifts for good behaviour and bad gifts for bad behaviour. These stories explain Christmas traditions. For example, in many European countries, children leave their shoes out for Saint Nicholas. They hope he will fill their shoes with treats.\nVoice 1  \nThere are also other stories about Saint Nicholas. In Greece, he is not a secret gift-giver. Instead, he is the saint who protects sailors. It is said that in bad weather, sailors would pray to Saint Nicholas. Then he would appear to them like a dream. He would guide them to safety and could make the storms go away.\nVoice 2  \nIt is not clear exactly when Saint Nicholas died. But many people believe that he died in the year 343 A.D. He was then buried in the city of Myra. Because of his goodness, many religious people travelled to the place he was buried. But during the 11th century, there was war in the area of Myra. A group of sailors used the war as a chance to steal the bones of Saint Nicholas. They brought them to Bari, Italy. That is where Saint Nicholas is buried today.\nVoice 1  \nIf you believe the stories, Saint Nicholas is the Christmas saint. In many European countries, he is called Saint Nicholas. In Italy he is San Nicola. In the Netherlands they call him Sinterklaas. In the United States, he is Santa Claus. And in Britain, he is Father Christmas. He has many names, but the idea of the person is the same. He is a gift-giver who brings good cheer at Christmas time.\nErik Bro at Dutch Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nVoice 2  \nBut Saint Nicholas believed in a very different kind of Christmas gift. Christians like Saint Nicholas celebrate Christmas as a time to remember Jesus’ birth. Christians believe that Jesus was a gift to the world. They believe he was both God and human. And because Jesus lived as a human, he knows what it is like to have pain and hurt, joys and happiness. Christians believe that in Jesus’ birth, God comes to earth. God brought the gift of hope to a broken world.\nVoice 1  \nDoes your culture celebrate a Christmas Saint? What stories have you heard about Saint Nicholas? You can leave a comment on our website.
